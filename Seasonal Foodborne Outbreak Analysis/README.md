**README:** Foodborne Outbreaks Seasonal Analysis

# Foodborne Outbreaks Seasonal Analysis ðŸ¦ 

Project Overview: This project investigates the seasonal variation in foodborne illness outbreaks using data from the CDC (1998-2015). The analysis aims to determine whether foodborne illnesses peak during the summer months (June, July, August) due to warmer temperatures and increased outdoor cooking activities.


**Features**

â€¢	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handles missing values and ensures data quality.

â€¢	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses histograms, CDFs, and other statistical methods to identify patterns and correlations.

â€¢	Seasonal Analysis: Examines the prevalence of outbreaks across different seasons.

â€¢	Visualization: Provides clear visual representations of the findings.
