"very fast paced, demanding job, lack of communication",either you were working 40+ hours a week or getting almost none. management were never on the same page so you would be told one thing and then get yelled at by another for doing what you were told.,2,Former Employee,"Automotive Tech, Cashier, Customer Service Desk ","Portage, WI",1/21/18,2018,1,21

Good place,a typical day at Walmart will be depending on the section you were located at. I learn how to communicated with customers and learn how to solve problems. management is always on point the associates and there is conflicts. The hardest part of Walmart is nothing really. The most enjoyable part of the job is the associates.,3,Former Employee,Sale Associate / Phone Operator ,"White Plains, NY",1/21/18,2018,1,21

Big company little benefits,Wal-Mart is a big company and the associates can and do get lost in the shuffle sometimes. My personal experience was one that I would say was not very favorable to the needs of my family. Which is why I left the company when I did.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Festus, MO",1/21/18,2018,1,21
Enjoyed working at Walmart,Working at Walmart was a great experience.  I made life long friends with some of my co-workers!  Working at Walmart helped prepare me for future jobs.,4,Former Employee,TRUCK UNLOADER AND TIRE LUBE EXPRESS TECHNICIAN ,"Olathe, KS",1/21/18,2018,1,21

It was a friendly environment.,"A typical day included, unloading trucks, preparing items to be stocked, and stocking. I learned how to properly and safely use equipment, such as pallet jacks also balers. Management was very understanding tough situations. The most difficult part of the job was getting the trucks unloaded in a reasonable time.",3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Midwest City, OK",1/21/18,2018,1,21
Its a job,"The employees there were great and some of the management staff were as well but there's always some sour apples. It was like a new team came in and got rid of the ""old timers"" and kept the new people who didn't work as hard or did as much as the old staff.",2,Former Employee,orderly product displays ,"Erwin, NC",1/21/18,2018,1,21
Longs hours,"What can i say, its retail.  Your work life Balance is absolutely terrible.  Your pay is from what i understand batter than most.  Hard to hire good quality help.",2,Former Employee,Shift Manager ,"Columbus, OH",1/21/18,2018,1,21
"Stressful sometimes, but can be fun","Being a cashier here was not too bad for the most part. The worst part was that customers would sometimes get mad about things you don't have control over, such as the prices of items. It was also not very fun to have to wait for a customer service manager to help you out, as a lot of times, they would be very slow about responding, sometimes because they are too busy goofing off instead of working. That would sometimes make the customer even more angry. _x000D__x000D_It was also not fun when there were a lot of call-ins or co-workers running late. If it is the end of your shift, most of the time you could turn off your lane's light and get ready to leave on your own. However, some of the front end managers would get angry and try to force you to stay past your shift without asking if you could or not. _x000D__x000D_The best part about the job is the good and friendly customers. I did have a lot of rude ones, but there were also many that were understanding even when things would go wrong. Those customers made the job worth the troubles. The best was seeing the regulars and recognizing them, and they would also recognize me. _x000D__x000D_The pay is also great, compared to a lot of other retail jobs. You also get a 10% discount on certain items when you work here.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Lafayette, CO",1/21/18,2018,1,21
Terrible place to work,"Only thing about this job that's good is you get an hour lunch and two fifteen minute paid breaks which sometimes management won't let you take. Management sucks, they're unorganized stand around and do nothing but yell at their associates. Wonder why their turn over rate is terrible.",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Johnson City, NY",1/21/18,2018,1,21

Fast-paced and stressful with good benefits.,"My experience at Walmart was somewhat mixed. Most of if not all of my fellow employees were extremely nice and friendly people. The supervisors were all kind and willing to help if you ever needed anything. However, management is another story altogether. Walmart has a stigma for having ""dumb"" employees. The problem is even management believes the stigma to a certain degree. I'm not saying all managers do, but the majority of them believe that. I was constantly talked down to by managers that didn't even work close to the area I did. Luckily the manager in my area was one of the few who didn't immediately assume you were an idiot. This stigma is also the main reason why advancement is so difficult at Walmart.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Chippewa Falls, WI",1/21/18,2018,1,21
Good environment,"Good to work for and the employees treated each other like family. Store Manager, Co Managers, Assistants and Supervisors were very understandable and always available when needed.",4,Former Employee,Accounting Office Associate ,"Deltona, FL",1/21/18,2018,1,21
"Good company culture, but inconsistent work schedule","A company that values respect for the individual at its core for fellow associates and customers.

Work schedule can be varied, but is usually available 3 weeks out to plan.",4,Current Employee,Co-Manager ,"South Bend, IN",1/21/18,2018,1,21

It is an okay place to work.,"Its a job, managers are fair an friendly, be flexible, learning everything you can in the store is very useful, the work place is very cultured, so try to get to know your co-workers, hardest part of the job is probably all the heavy lifting and running around when short handed. The enjoyable part of the job is when the customer walks out the doors happy.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Emporia, KS",1/21/18,2018,1,21

It's a ok place to work,"I believe if they communicated more with their employees, it would be a good place to work.We have some very good assistant manager, once again the communication needs to be better. I also feel like they choose who they will let move up, instead of giving everyone a chance to move up.",3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Vacaville, CA",1/21/18,2018,1,21
Undergoing changes,"Walmart was undergoing lots of changes in the areas I worked at, I had few associates to work for me and I managed to do most of the work myself.  Very tiring.",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"San Diego, CA",1/21/18,2018,1,21
Productive and fun workplace,"I love working for walmart, typically it is a fast pace environment. Management is great here, and I am able to learn from each and every manager. Walmart carries a strong value in ethics; we believe in treating everyone the same and respecting their culture and values. The hardest part of the job is allowing myself to understand that everyone blunders during the work, but keeping the mindset to exceed in everything I do. On the bright side, I love meeting new people and leaving a positive impact on their lives.",5,Current Employee,Customer Services Representative ,"Huntsville, TX",1/21/18,2018,1,21
High paced and customer oriented,A large part of your job at Wal-Mart will be interacting and helping customers.

Walmart,"working there everyone treats you like garbage, I did my job and did it well, the hours they gave me, I really didnt have time to do anything a normal person would, like leaving work at 12 am, and for the pay of the work in combination with the work environment was not worth in to me to stay.",1,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Rocklin, CA",1/21/18,2018,1,21
It is what you make it.,"If you want to work hard and move up, you’re generally able to do so. However a lot of people don’t which puts more on your plate because you have to pick up the slack. Management is rotated semi frequently which effects how things go in a day, some managers have different agendas as others.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Kansas City, MO",1/21/18,2018,1,21
Great company with tons of advancement opportunities,"After 20 years of working for Walmart, the only reason that I am currently seeking other employment is due to a corporate restructure that is likely to eliminate my current position.  Despite popular belief due to constant negative media reports about the company, Walmart is a great place to work!  The pay and benefits are comparable, and often better, than at similar employers.  There are advancement opportunities for anyone who applies themselves and contributes positively to the company.  I would recommend Walmart to anyone who is interested in working in retail.",5,Current Employee,Co-Manager ,"Hillsboro, OH",1/21/18,2018,1,21

Not the best place to work,"Really not the best place to work, especially after getting a new store manager.... The whole store is going down hill. And they are making us less staffed then it already was, and making it impossible to have a life outside of work because they think everyone needs to have open availability and that they can change peoples schedules the day before because it suits management better.",1,Current Employee,Associate ,CT,1/21/18,2018,1,21

Friendly co-workers,The experience was okay. I had a lot of fun working with the co-workers since they were all friendly. Hardest part about the job is you have to deal with customers who don't care about anything but what they want and will rush you. Hope you have a tolerance for that.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Ooltewah, TN",1/21/18,2018,1,21

It was an ok job.,I liked some of the management and my position. I liked the pay. I did not like the lack of holiday pay. I did not like the part time positions. Wal-Mart does not hire any full time employees at this time unless you can jump in at a management position. I do not like how hard it is to advance within the company.,3,Former Employee,Retail Salesperson/Bakery Associate ,"Fort Collins, CO",1/21/18,2018,1,21

Stressful and unrewarding job,Basically your a tool. You do what management says regardless of policies or laws. you can't get overtime unless it;s christmas due to them not wanting to hire enough to cover areas. The store is to big to be taken out of your area to help another and they leave your area understaffed a lot.  They try to work with less and less so management can get a better bonus. Most of the employees will stab you in the back to get a better position and rarely use good work ethics or teamwork to accomplish anything. they don't care about your health or well being for the most part and will find any excuse to fire an employee over health issues.,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Clinton, TN",1/21/18,2018,1,21

A job to work your life away,At Walmart the amount you get paid is fair and even though you get offered benefits as a full-time employee they work you right to the make as a full time employee but still keep you right there where you are accounted for a part time employee position so they don't have to give you benefits. If you are someone looking to gain customer service experience this is not the place it is overly stressful and out of control this will ruin customer service for you. The management isn't the best because none gets paid enough to care. The only enjoyable part of this job was knowing i had a pretty stable amount of hours each week. The hardest part of this job is not losing your sanity.,2,Former Employee,Cashier and Customer Service representative ,"Westminster, CO",1/21/18,2018,1,21

Retaliation and special treatments towards certain associates are rampant. Consumer demand outweighs corporate guidelines for payroll and much needed help. Because of lack of training, managers expectations are textbook dreams. If you love what you do and love giving your 100% this job will consume you, ""burning out"" is an everyday occurrence.

trouble rolls down hill,"I had never worked retail.  I decided to give Wal-mart a chance, seeing that I did most of my shopping there.  The deli work was fast paced and I liked that.  Unfortunately the pay was low.  The management had a hard time keeping our deli fully stocked.  This made customers frustrated.  It also affected our productivity and sales.  The Deli Manager resigned while I was there.  There was no replacement brought on board.  This caused more stress in the deli and also a lot of gossip and employee's trying to position themselves for the job.  The Managers were becoming more and more frustrated and it trickled down to the deli workers.

In 3 years all but 5 managers have changed and I've seen those positions get filled over and over because managers don't like working there. Schedules are erratic and hours fluctuate a lot. Shifts are random with very few managers willing to make it regular for their associates.  Associates and management team are not trained I  a way that everyone is on the same page.  Different managers are trained different in policy and process. In turn associates are trained different depending on the manager.

My Thoughts On Walmart,"They do offer flex schedules for certain positions so the flexibility is a plus but for the job we are expected to do we do not get sufficient compensation.  I like working at Walmart as it is a very relaxed environment, there is no micromanagement, and as long as you get your job done you have all the flexibility you need.  I do appreciate that.  My only major issue is the pay, and their holiday practices.  I don't understand why we should have to use our vacation (which isn't allotted to us at the beginning of the year, we have to accrue PTO as we work) if we wish to get paid for a national holiday.  The center is closed so we don't have the option of coming to work but if we want to get paid for holidays we have to either use our vacation, make up the time (depending on the which day the holiday falls on), or take it unpaid.

Depending on location and your supervisor, one can be given a lot of latitude.  My work experience in Odessa, Texas afforded me a lot of latitude because of my work and dedication to my work, and dedication to those subordinates that needed my support, regardless of type of support.  On the other hand when I transferred to San Antonio, Texas, I was clipped and the store had a broken system of cronyism within management and subordinates alike.  In other words, management lacked professionalism, and as a veteran I was targeted for removal, as well as other veterans within Walmart.

I would ensure the machines and drink fridges were spotless and there were enough bags for each self use machine. All throughout my shift I was on constant watch for possible theft attempts, and deterred any suspicious customers. I worked for Wal-Mart for well over a year, and passed the test to become a Customer Service Manager, but because of poor management, I was never given the chance to fill my desired roll. The part of the job I enjoyed most was, engaging with the customers. It allowed for me to interact with the people of my community and better understand what kind of people I shared a hometown with.

Walmart,since I have been working at Walmart I have dealt with verbal abuse from both costumers and management. My managers want us to my robots and always be happy even when we are being yelled at for no reason. I have gotten in trouble many time just because someone didn't like my personality.

They understood when we would work our hardest and didn't complete our task. They stood beside their employees. I always enjoyed the people I worked with. We was our own little family.

I enjoyed my years with Walmart and would recommend working there.,I learned many valuable skills in my twenty seven year career with Walmart. I began as a warehouse associate and worked my way up to manager of the grocery warehouse.  A typical day in the grocery warehouse is always fast paced working with vendors from numerous different venues.  The most difficult part of my job was verifying the inventory coming in matched the invoices.  I was the go to person if there was a discrepancy. I would research it and make the necessary corrections.  The most enjoyable part of my work was all the people I have met over the years.,4,Former Employee,Direct Store Delivery Manager ,"El Paso, TX",1/15/18,2018,1,15
Average,"Walmart pays there store managers well.  Benefits are great, stock options, 401k.  If you're a workaholic then you will be fine.

You are in charge of every aspect of the store, and it falls on your shoulders when its crunch time.  You need to have managerial courage when it comes to your salary members of management.  You must be fair, firm and consistent.  Workplace culture is ""put the time in.""  _x000D__x000D_Hardest part of the job is that there is no work life balance, and the talent pool to find good managers and employees is terrible.

"It started off great, and got progressively worse","The place demanded too much of its employees by the end of my employment. We moved 100 thousand plus cases a day, just on my side of the warehouse, and management was completely clueless. the hours were insane. Overall, while the pay was impressive, and the benefits were good, it took too much of a toll on your body, at work by 4 am, sometimes not off until 5 or 6 pm.

Bakery,"I enjoy working with customers in the bakery. The tasks are reasonable when there are enough associates available to work together (which is not often the case). I either bake or do donuts-anywhere from 4 am to 6 pm, depending on the schedule. Stock the floor,when there is time. Hardest part of the job is the freight-pallets are extremely heavy and time-consuming to break down and many of the associates have to be taken away from their main duties to do this-then our jobs suffer-we don't have regular freight persons to do this-it would make our job more efficient if we had that help. Many of the associates are pleasant to work with.

productive and hard work,"Working here wasn't to bad. A lot of people complain, but I found it very rewarding to further my management skill and helped me understand the other side of retail. It's hard to make a career here though, as the prospects for advancements are next to none. But the pay is amazing for someone who is looking for a great paying job to pay the bills.

Fast paced,"I was a pharmacist technician and we filled 700 plus prescriptions daily. It was very busy. I loved my job there but honest to God I felt over worked and underpaid!!! I was so unhappy I had to put in my two weeks notice. They are very hard on their employees. I honestly feel their technicians deserve $15-16 hourly with that work load and with the cost of living the Technicians honestly deserve that ! Instead, the pay was horrible it was more like $10-$11 hourly..... Wal Mart is a Billion dollar company there is no way they can’t meet the demands of those who desire and deserve a higher wage/salary ! It’s a great investment because most employees there spend the money they earn from the company right back into the company!!!!

I honestly believe cashiers do so much and get paid so little and some don't even work at all. It has been a while sine I last worked with them, although I would enjoy working there again. I just hope that management is more adamant about making sure that they work as a team and not slack off. The last time I worked there I was a customer service associate and cashiers weren't very helpful in their tasks. Some would just leave their carts full of returns and just walk around doing nothing and I would have to sort it all out when that was supposed to be done by them.

Average,"I stocked shelves and set up displays for a vendor not Walmart directly, but had to work with Walmart Associates and Management to do my job. Very poor customer service observed. Customers were always coming up to me a VENDOR-NOT A WALMART EMPLOYEE, for assistance because they couldn’t find any other Walmart Associates to help them. I mostly worked in the electronics Department. I liked my job and pay Through my Vendor was good. Just not enough hours. I work Part-Time.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Princeton, IN",1/14/18,2018,1,14
Learned new things daily and worked with several different personalities,"The typical work day is fast-paced and you're constantly busy. If you're not busy, something will be found for you to do. I learned many customer service skills such as telling the customer in terms of their vehicle what services were done and gave them suggestions of what to get fixed on the vehicle. Management is very peculiar on who is in the ""in-crowd"" and who is not. Most higher-up management were friends and if one manager doesn't like you, they all seem to have something against you. The entire environment is cliqued up and if you're welcome in the store all depends on how certain people feel about you. The hardest part of the Job would be the customer service. You always need to have your feelings put to the side when dealing with customers whether they are happy, sad, angry, or just calm. Most of the time, they hear a small change in your voice and assumptions are made. The most enjoyable part of working at this job was gaining the knowledge and skills I didn't have walking in.  I learned a new thing every single day and do not regret the experience and knowledge I have gained.",3,Current Employee,Service Writer / Certified Service Technician ,"Murfreesboro, TN 37128",1/13/18,2018,1,13

Walmart,"I worked for more than one location and each of them and each position was different.

Stressful workplace that is very customer centered.,"A typical day at work consisted mostly of running around the pharmacy in a state of ""controlled chaos"".

great long term job unless you want fast and fair advancements,"Was a wonderful job and was very fun and every day was absolutely different._x000D_However, very stressful for a cashier.

Awful,"Absolutely an awful place to work. Management is too worried about their own backs to realize they are the problem. If something goes wrong it falls on sales associates, cause management will throw everyone under the bus. They do not train you on the salesfloor, they just throw into a position and expect you to know what you're doing. Place is like a high school, gossip, back stabbing, and everyones mating. If you try to go above managements heads and talk to cooperate they will find out, and they will retaliate.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Bloomington, IN",1/13/18,2018,1,13

Management,"I worked at the Taylor Road exit for only five months. Could have been more, but I strongly disliked the area I worked due to the fixed hours for my schedule and the managers. For the fixed hours, you couldn't change it to your liking. It wasn't set like doing 3-11pm every Mon, Wed, and Friday. No, it was the company that would choose some random hours which was a BIG conflict to my school schedule at the time. This also ties to the managers. No one really listens to you and when you voice out your opinion and why your upset about something you have to be sent to a chain of different managers who have most of the time aren't even present. I'm glad I left the job. Only people I miss working with was the co-workers who I got close too.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Reynoldsburg, OH",1/13/18,2018,1,13

You are given contrary advice by just about every associate and manager, it is very rare to get a straightforward answer, and most times you are fed misinformation which is then fed to customers, which as a result creates frustration that has to be resolved by the very same managers who gave the incorrect information to begin with._x000D__x000D_Teamwork is few and far between, every associate I've worked with seems to be out for themselves and does not consider their fellow employee. This behavior is also displayed by members of management. Rarely if ever do they stop to work collaboratively with their associates. They seem to disappear into the back rooms and offices and rarely if ever work with their department on the floor. _x000D__x000D_Departments are characteristically understaffed at all times, meaning that associates from completely different departments have to rush to help others when they have received no training whatsoever on the procedures and products involved with the other departments, once more adding to the abundance of misinformation and confusion._x000D__x000D_Personnel/HR staff is also notorious for being completely useless at their very best.

Boarder line business practices,At the bottom level they intentionally keep employees under full time employment so as to not pay out insurance and benefits. however their human resource office is well versed in the local welfare options and how to apply for them. Also working to miniaturize work force as much as possible (self-checkouts).

Which is alright on occasion, but is very draining on a weekly basis. I have a production department (bakery) meaning we set-up and bake bread as well as decorate cakes. The sales for the department have been increasing since the start of me managing it. Although our hours and staffing has decreased. The co-manager and store manager always adding more to your existing work load which would be manageable if there was proper staffing. _x000D_I have learned a lot about managing people and motivating people to go the extra mile. I really enjoy working with associates and achieving a common goal. _x000D_The company as a whole does offer decent benefits. I personally have used the dental and vision.

"HRSS is relaxed, but....","Corporate Walmart is still subject to the same rules of Retail Walmart, and when you have a Corporate presence in a city with other major corporations, that won't keep quality associates. _x000D_Our city is full of Fortune 500 and 100 companies, who offer Paid Holidays. Walmart Corporate does not do that, so colleagues are left to use their PTO, go unpaid for the holiday, or work the Saturday prior to the holiday to make up 7.5 hours of the missing 8._x000D__x000D_What I noticed in my time there is that they also heavenly promote from within, which is commendable.

I sincerely hope not all Walmart's have the same type of blind eye management when it comes to workplace culture. The hardest part of the job were the co-workers and management. The best part were the customers. When I accepted the job, I thought the hard part would be interfacing with so many different types of customers. They were the best part.

It's the Walmart everyone already knows it to be.,"I worked here for about five months. I was fine with the overnight stocking position.

They don't micromanage but it's definitely very disorganized,"It was an easy job and I didn't mind it but the pay is very low and they started me off with a full time schedule, then once they raised our pay from 10.50 to 12.50, they cut my hours to where I was only working like once or twice a week",2,Former Employee,Cap Team 1 Associate ,"Renton, WA",1/10/18,2018,1,10

"Stressful expectations, great co-workers and great hours","A typical day at work would involve unloading our daily two trucks, keeping the backroom clean, restocking store shelves, and taking care of whatever problems customers have given any opportunity._x000D_I learned a lot about proper zoning, stocking, department organization and management as a CAP Team Associate. At Walmart, depending on where you work, you'll be working at a snail's pace or at 10 miles/minute. From management constantly changing the workplace, abnormally high truck freight(before AND after the holidays), to fluctuating expectations from the higher-ups, Walmart is indeed a super-stressful place to work. But with such a high responsibility and a high task, it's a great place to make friends with co-workers. If you need a good amount of hours at the expense of a rough workload, I would recommend, but don't throw caution into the wind.",3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Team Associate ,"Merritt Island, FL",1/10/18,2018,1,10

Poorly Managed,Everyday you had to do someone else's job along with your own. I learned to make sure I am always taken care of first due to poor management looking out for themselves. The culture was cut throat. I enjoyed helping the customers. And that is why I stayed.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Burlington, NJ",1/10/18,2018,1,10
Public image is important,"It's all about the public image. Yes, they provide great benefits. Yes, they start you out at a great rate of pay. Yes, you do get yearly raises. This is all for their public image. The truth is that the $10 an hour they started someone with zero experience out with, doing the same job as someone that's been there 5 years and making $9. It no longer matters how great or terrible of an employee you are, because in February you will receive a 2% raise the same as everyone else. Which is 15 to 30 cents and approximately covers the new cost of insurance. So, in short you cannot get ahead.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Dothan, AL",1/10/18,2018,1,10
Productive good place to work,"I worked as an orderfiller for Walmart, my Co workers are pretty cool management sucks.

pays the bills when you have hours,stores made up of good and bad customers and workers. wide variety of people and no apparent limits on vertical mobility if you're up for the task. managers are hardest part of job due to variation in ability and difficulty finding one to help. most enjoyable part is the good people that make days go smooth and the bonuses received when accidents are avoided,4,Current Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"San Antonio, TX",1/10/18,2018,1,10

Overall Walmart,"Walmart has taught me many lessons in life, one of the most important was to get everything in writing.  The easiest job you can ever have is cashiering, but it is hard to learn through experience.  Everyone is willing to help because they have all been there before and it really helps build teamwork when you ask questions and get the answers you never knew you needed.",5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Broomfield, CO",1/10/18,2018,1,10

Productive fun work environment,"Was trained as a cashier. Worked as a cashier for a couple of weeks. A quick change artist asked me to make change for him several times. The next day my manager called me into the office asking why my register was short by a few hundred dollars. I hadn't stolen any money, but the quick change artist had come in. I suggested they review the security tape so they could see my actions during my shift. They reviewed the footage and moved me to the garden center, worked there until I was injured with a hernia.

They had to many regulations that did not allow us to go above and beyond our job descriptions to help the customer.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"San Diego, CA",1/10/18,2018,1,10
A good place to work but no value for HR,"I loved my position at Walmart and worked there for many years. But as an HR professional I was consistently dismayed and disappointed in how undervalued and underutilized the function was. The most senior executive HR positions were always held by operations leaders waiting for their next Ops role. Field HR is tactical and administrative and spread VERY thin, considering each store does not have an HR manager.

Was ok at best,"I worked at Walmart for 6 years and at first was alright but as time passed it was a downhill roll. The hours were completely inconsistent, management spent way too much time micro-managing associates and was never on top of important things. I was pulled from my department on an hour to hour basis and was often coached for not completing my responsibilities. Overall the worst is part of my experience was working for so many years and still making the same pay as those walking in the door if not less so. Now my experience may have ended on a sad note but I did have a slew of opportunities to learn skills for the workplace and took as many as I could get. The benefits were ok but they at least offered health vision and dental insurance. The discount could have been much better and not controlled my customer complaint.",2,Former Employee,Wireless Sales Associate ,"Cherryville, NC",1/10/18,2018,1,10

My (Current) Experience with Walmart,"Usually busy, handle many types of people everyday and it definitely builds up on the stress factor because you can get a wonderful person then next thing you know someone will be screaming in your face (though i think that's retail in general). You do learn how to handle all sorts of people, however, which is a good takeaway from the position and can move to different departments fairly easily. Management is constantly changing and you'll have at least 4 or 5 new assistant managers every year, a new store manager every other year, etc. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part can be juggling between responsibilities (if the position you're in requires you to) though all that is really expected of you is to provide excellent customer service. _x000D__x000D_The most enjoyable part are the coworkers because you'll meet all sorts of people there and it's easy to find someone else you can mesh with. Another is leniency on sick days you can take, full time or part time.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",1/10/18,2018,1,10
Slow paced and favoritism is the key in Jet.,For the  most part there really isn't enough work. They hire too many people and end up vtoing half the time. Most of the managers are power tripping and treat employees like they are just completely beneath them. The managers honestly have more issues and drama compared to the associates.

"If you liked being stabbed in the back, this one is for you.","Work there is really not that hard if you apply yourself,  However, if you do not kiss butt, disagree with management and are repressed from voicing your opinion, not for you.  Management would rather back customers that are wrong and give them anything they want instead of backing up their employees.  Not allowed to defend yourself and they don't enforce their own rules and policies.  Instead, they discipline their employees for trying to enforce their policies and hate anyone who disagrees with their decisions.

Steadily been going down hill,"While many blame our new store manager, I don't believe they're solely responsible for the decline in work culture. It seems Corporate has shifted more from taking care of their employees in favor of taking care of customers. _x000D_I do understand this move since if we have no customers, we have no business thus lose jobs however a company should try to balance this. Because, as Sam Walton once said, ""If we take care of our staff, they will take care of our customers"". We've recently undergone a new system change which has slashed the hours of those who can not have open availability. It feels like punishment for wanting to have a life outside the company and is especially baffling when you consider they're cutting hours in areas that need constant attention such as sales counters. _x000D_I didn't want to leave because I do receive good benefits and there are many employees I consider friends. But between the cut hours, the long drive to and from work and the almost suffocating atmosphere of new policies, I feel no choice but to move on. _x000D_Wal-Mart has taught me a lot and I look forward to implementing those skills into future careers such as handling unique, sometimes difficult customers.

Easy,"Walmart is not the place to work if you're looking for friendship or comrades. Sure the work is easy, but also monotonous. A typical day at work started with me clocking in, and then going to a check out lane to start working. The cashiers would constantly be pulled out to do stocking for a manager who had no jurisdiction over us. We shouldn't have to do a job we aren't being payed for. Our job is to check customers out and make sure they had a pleasant shopping experience while maintaining the front end of the store. The management team was sarcastic and rude. They weren't understanding of myself or others. If I could give a zero star rating in management I would. There is no workplace culture, it's every person for themselves.

"Horribly Managed, Stressful, Low Pay","In my experience, working at Walmart was stressful to say the least. The actual job isn't hard. I've worked all over the store, and nothing is too difficult.

And again. And again before any issue is solved. Even basic duties (like finalizing schedules, etc.) that they are supposed to do without anyone asking don't get done until the last minute, or later. Everyone you work with only does the bare minimum of what's required. The store is extremely disorganized, employees steal other employee's work tools when they lose their own, departments go without required work tools, and of course the customers suck. I cannot stress enough how much the customers suck. The pay sucks. The people suck. Just do yourself a favor and work somewhere else.",2,Former Employee,"Accounting Office Associate, Personal Shopper ","Wharton, TX",1/9/18,2018,1,9

Good hard working management crew,"Walmart is a super fast paced work environment..red bull/rock star and monster energy drinks are consumed like water. Never a dull day, associates will run you ragged on mundane issues while corporate(market/region/division) keep the pressure on as well as emphasis on the ever evolving new and better processes. My only complaint was no work/life balance for management. Interestingly enough department managers and support managers/hourly,have great schedules and 40hrs.(OT is voluntary and rare at a well run store). A common misnomer is that associates don't get many hours and suffer low wages. Hard working associates get hours and raises...go figure. Many part timers are students and retired and_x000D_they fit perfectly and the pay is competitive plus.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Fort Collins, CO",1/9/18,2018,1,9

"Simple work, but must be done quickly. There is no room for laziness.","The work is very simple, but requires teamwork. You must be a team player and have good communication and conflict resolution skills. The work is split between team work when unloading trucks, and individual work when stocking shelves. Make sure that you can lift heavy boxes and work in hot conditions for at least 2 hours at a time. You must work quickly and efficiently to get everything sorted in the allotted amount of time. If you appear to be lazy or slow, then your teammates will quickly realize this and pressure you to do better. If your performance falls too low, then management will give you a warning and proceed with disciplinary action if work does not improve.",4,Former Employee,Cap2 Associate ,"Newport, AR",1/9/18,2018,1,9

The manager in the pharmacy department wasn't exactly a good or professional manger, but the mangers throughout the entire store were spectacular!

Its an easy job sometimes.,"Your experience depends on the type of management at your particular store. The managers I work with are always giving tasks to be done with an unrealistic time frame for it to be done in. They also say one thing and a week or two later change their minds making more work for the associates. Sometimes the changes come from home office, but it's mostly from the assistant managers & up.

Not the best at times.,"When I first started our schedules were set with 2days off in a row. Now that there is a new manager at that store no hours are safe and days off are split. I went from morning shifts to almost every other day morning to night to mid to night to morning. With lack of sleep and days off I ended up falling asleep at the wheel with my child in the vehicle with me. Tried to change my schedule to set hours so this doesn't happen again and lost hours because of it. I am the soul provider, I needed to leave in order to make sure my family is safe.

Quick summary of being a cashier,"As a cashier I found the customer service managers hard to find or often talking to other associates a lot, sometimes more than necessary.

Starter Job,I believe everyone should work in this type of environment at some point in their lives. It builds character to be able to put up with customers that really do not care for your store.

No lunches,"No lunches, always mandated overtime, management is horrible and invisible, and lazy. Pay is only good thing here, they’re taking everything else away.

"Great job, Great culture, suggestive management","Most people you will encounter are amazing and will give the shirt off their back.

Terrible management and poor handling of time,"Management tended to either leave the associates to themselves and nothing would get done, or breath down everyone's necks, which for someone with certain anxieties about being snuck up on, this is not a very good situation. The only enjoyable part of this job was a few of my fellow associates who happened to be decently competent at their jobs.",2,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Pensacola, FL",1/8/18,2018,1,8
Great place to work,Walmart has many opportunities for advancement if you want to move up! They take into consideration if your are a student when doing scheduling and work around your school schedule! A typical day at Walmart is very busy and fast paced.

Problematic management style,"Managers abuse their authority and are unwilling (most of them) to do the same work they assign. Often they expect you to work in every other department doing other people's jobs, but then give punitive responses when your work isn't finished. Employees are often overworked because the store is not properly staffed. Management shows preferential treatment of certain individuals and allows drama to continue needlessly.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Meridian, ID",1/8/18,2018,1,8
Fun and friendly work environment,"I worked as a Cap 2 associated and then transferred to the bakery department. Cap 2 taught me how to be efficient on the line, and  how to stack numerous boxes onto a pallet without having it fall as you bring it onto the sales floor later in the shift. I've learned a lot from the team that I have had with different locations. The bakery was a lot of fun and helped me get better with time management. it's all about baking and bringing it onto the floor at a certain time.

Loved some of my coworkers...,"I like everybody. But the company doesn't often inspire motivation, neither does management. And unmotivated workers make your day more stressful and means more work for you if you're a hard worker. Which makes it frustrating. And I get it, it's a stressful low paid job. Some people are just there for school and don't care about the job. _x000D__x000D_A typical day at Walmart: me working pretty much non-stop, 4 associates walking around talking, thus I have to help every customer, so that I can let other people chit chat all day and get paid the same amount of money. Then after feeling like I'm doing a great job despite this, management comes along and says why aren't you done yet? Also we need you to go cashier in this random other side of the store or do this other thing. _x000D__x000D_But don't worry, they'll never bother with the chit chatters cause they know they don't work. Sometimes there's not much they can do. Also there are some pretty amazing managers too, but people are people. And stress comes to everyone. Just smile do your share and don't stress over it. _x000D__x000D_I've had a lot of fun with the coworkers I worked closest with, and often completed tasks with.

Poor management and bad training,"There was almost no support when you as an associate needed help with something. They make you watch videos and then throw you into it.

I learned that it is beneficial for me to help more, for advancement of time and productivity. Management was decent, although my manager was rarely around it felt. The workplace culture was very odd for me, the upper-level managers were very encouraging and friendly. While, the workers would play into it, behind closed doors they were rude to each other and had cliques. The hardest part of the job was I did not feel challenged enough, and would result in disappointment for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was unloading the trucks, watering the plants when that time would come, as well as actively engaging the customers and making sure their needs were met.",3,Former Employee,Garden Center Associate ,"Alva, OK",1/8/18,2018,1,8

Productive workplace,Everyday i came and clocked in at the service desk and set up my work area making sure it was clean and there was supplies and enough money for financial  transactions. As customers start to come in I would take care of them while organizing merchandise that was returned and delegating associates in departments to help with getting merchandise returned and stocked in their areas. If lines became long and there were other associates to cover the desk I would assist with cashiering in the front end. I would also assist with zoning and setting up displays around store.I learned how to provide fast and friendly customer service to customers and manage my team assertively to get our job done.The culture was very diverse. The hardest part was not being able to be in multiple positions when staff was short. I really enjoyed  my coworkers ability to work as a team and be respectful to one another. I also learned how to recognize scammers and handle escalations.,5,Former Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE ASSOCIATE ,"Alpharetta, GA",1/8/18,2018,1,8
Poor experience,I had a very poor experience for the 11 months I worked at Walmart from the first store I was hired from and the second store I was transferred to. Poor management as well as poor hours. A typical day at work for me involved scoldings from managers and absolutely rude customers. My experience nonetheless is nothing like what some of my coworkers experienced. It depends on the person being hired on. I did however love the Walmart holiday parties thrown in the break rooms. It always felt like a big family gathering.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,NV,1/8/18,2018,1,8

The most enjoyable part of the job was getting off of work.,1,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Youngstown, OH",1/8/18,2018,1,8
My concern,Walmart should work with the employer school schedule and never ask a employer to pick between there education or there job. Walmart manager will ask their employees to work over time then the next day tell you tell leave early because you can not get paid over time. I worked for Walmart for 4 years and never got promoted for my hard work. A customer called Walmart Corporate to give me a compliment   about my customer service ethic and I did not get recognize for my hard work.,3,Former Employee,Electronic/Wireless/Photo Sale Associate ,"Marietta, GA",1/8/18,2018,1,8

Good place to work at one time,"So much has changed so it hard to give an opinion of Walmart today. Management always needs more training at WalMart. Some do not have skills to know how to talk to their associates. I'd say that if I had to recommend any additional training it would be in active listening. Still, the other associates you will work with are some of the best people you will ever meet. You learn to work as a team or you will find it difficult to work there. I worry about some of the new policies I have heard that they are implicating this year. I'd say that the best part of working for Walmart is the coworkers you will work alongside.

Some of the other CSMs don't even work; others will be lazy when a certain person is working. On most days I am forced to carry the workload of at least 5 supervisors. With that much of a workload, coupled with constant instruction and intimidation from management, I've eventually had panic attacks and was forced by a medical professional to take a leave of absence. Upon returning from leave, nothing has changed; in fact, the work environment has gotten worse. This is a hostile and toxic work environment.

It has many good things she some not so good.,4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Lincoln, NE",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Friendly Fast Paced,"Overall Wal-Mart is a fast paced , friendly environment. Management is open and workable with hours or shifts that need to be adjusted for personal reasoning. Most enjoyable part is exceptional training and experience you receive to become a resourceful Wal-Mart family member. Challenging part would be the customer interaction which is sometimes not so great. Ensuring a great work atmosphere for yourself never take anything personnel.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rancho Cordova, CA",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Do not work here,Walmart may have great items to purchase but they're a terrible employer. They treat the employees like lower class citizens that are not worthy of anything.,1,Former Employee,Employee ,"Indianapolis, IN",1/4/18,2018,1,4

Good Experience,I have to say that I learned a lot working at Walmart. I began as an overnight stocker and I advanced to over the counter Pharmacy Department Manager within a 3 year period. It is a very big company but as long as you go to work and do your job you shouldn't have any problems.,2,Former Employee,Department Manager/Sales Associate ,"Royal Palm Beach, FL",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Employees are treated poorly and not appreciated,"A good place to start and can keep a job or move up indefinitely if you are willing to be treated poorly and taken advantage of. The company chooses to keep the wrong people around such as, people with bad work habits and low work ethic. There are hard workers and good people but are out numbered by comers and goers.",3,Current Employee,Deli Associate/stocker ,"Albuquerque, NM",1/4/18,2018,1,4
walmart,"don't be expecting great pay or great hours, they will constantly change and you will be expected to work weekends, nights, and all holidays. Walmart is a good first time job and move on after you found something better.",2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Crystal Lake, IL",1/4/18,2018,1,4
The hardest part of the job.....,I would have to say dealing with rude and uncooperative people. The best part was making someones day by finding what they were looking for or helping that one person who you can tell is having a rough day. Not to mention getting a compliment to the manager from a shopper about how great you are.,4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Tarentum, PA",1/4/18,2018,1,4

Walmar is a good first job or a job to get you on your feet.,"If Wal-Mart is your first job or if you are struggling to get on your feet then its a decent place to work. Overall, the company is poorly run. They only give the store so many work hours for each week and expect the limited number of associates to get all the work done otherwise they cut everyone's hours and hire more people. They rarely hire full time associates anymore and even when you have been there they do not offer full time unless you are promoted to department manager. They expect one associate to do the job of 3 people and then scold you and write you up when you don't get it done. They are unorganized, undisciplined and figure since they are so well known and recognized they do not have to work as hard to get customers to shop there. I have been to numerous other retailers who have their stores organized and clean, with well trained employees who actually know their store. They claim to have the lowest prices on everything but I notice I end up shopping at other retailers due to sales even with a decent discount on general merchandise. If you are looking for a job where you never get to spend any time with your family, or get a weekend off (or holiday) you can go into the medical, fire, or law enforcement field or you can work at Wal-Mart.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Bowling Green, KY",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Good stable place to work,"It is a good place to work, friendly and calm._x000D_The management, however, need to be review. Too many customers during the rush time, and not enough workers.",3,Former Employee,Cashie ,"3795 Buford Mill Dr, Georgia 30045",1/4/18,2018,1,4
A fun place to work,"A typical day  at work was busy. I was a department manager for the connection center I had daily reports  and inventory  to run. I assisted in two  other departments.  I learned  how to run the photo lab and learned all of the working aspects of  the retail environment. Management at times were great ,the workplace culture was wonderful. The hardest part of my job was not enough hours in the day to get everything done. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the public for the most part very enjoyable and rewarding.",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Indianapolis, IN",1/4/18,2018,1,4

It was pretty fast pace,typically we would stock inventory. I was night shift so everything was still pretty fast pace. i learned about customer service and how to talk to people. Management.. i felt like they had there favorites at times. the hardest part of the job was when you had to restock candy and zone that place as well.. it was the worse. the most enjoyable part was i had friends there an we would help each other with the work load.,3,Former Employee,Stocker Associate ,"Sunnyside, WA",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Being a Cashier is Hard,"I struggle with anxiety, so I know that played a huge factor in my leaving this position, but being a cashier at Wal-Mart is not easy. People will give you a verbal beating about anything from expired coupons to difference of shelf prices to tag prices to ID-ing for alcohol (alcohol is by far the worst). The worst part is that cashiers can't do anything outside of the policies they're required to uphold. What put me over the edge though was a manager who laughed at me when I told them I  had been transferred to a different department for the weekends and told me to ""go to number 7."" A lot of the cashiering management was like that. I liked my coworkers, though.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Apparel Associate ,"Stillwater, OK",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Productive and fun place to work. Happy customers.,Wal-Mart is a fun and productive place to work. Lots of opportunity for job advancements and promotions. Very dedicated to bring customers low prices. Save money. Live better.,4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Sacramento, CA",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Great place to work,"I really enjoyed my time working with Walmart. My biggest gripe would be that stores will vary depending on who your store manager is. They have good structure that they are supposed to follow but Walmart allows some deviation at the store managers discretion. This can sometimes cause micromanaging and lead to distrust. Managers often have communication issues and could use assistance with delegation. If you enjoy helping customers, or just have superb customer service skills, Walmart is a good place for you. Good customer service is rewarded very often.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"West Des Moines, IA",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Sales,Selling everything in the department from Tv's to alarm clock radios.  Every day learning something new about the job. Work as a team or by yourself for all walks of life.  The hardest part of the job is staying fresh with new technology.  Helping people which is what I like to do on a daily basis.,3,Current Employee,Electronics Cashier and Sales Associate ,"Jackson, TN",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Stressful and (mostly) Unaccommodating,"I went in informing them I had conditions that needed to be accommodated. The store I was at treated it like it was a burden, and those to did genuinely try to help were washed out by the higher ups. I felt very disposable and not at all cared about. It felt as though my achievements were nothing compared to my mistakes.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Indianapolis, IN",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Fun place to work,It was a very relaxed place to work at. I would run the floor and take care of customers for most of the day. I would also be in charge of taking care of the inventory and running photo lab. It was never stressful.,4,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",1/4/18,2018,1,4

Good Place to work with decent benefits,Wal-Mart overnight shift is a fast-paced stressful environment. while the job doesn't sound difficult the complex and multiple levels that the jobs has can be overwhelming. The management staff are decent on overnight and are willing to develop all associates to advance to management positions.

it was a fun place to work,"A day at walmart was good i enjoyed working there the employees where great . i  learned about my job was learning how to put up fraight on the shelves the proper way . managers where nice to help out.

Dreaded going in to work each day,It was a very low paying job. It was very difficult to get noticed for being an above and beyond worker. You are not compensated fairly for the work ethic you put in or for the work that they require you to do. There are strict working guidelines and they don't consider you to be of value to the company.,1,Former Employee,Accounting Office Associate ,"Wilmington, NC",1/4/18,2018,1,4

Not as what is advertised to work there.,"I was more than capable of doing whatever job needed doing but never got to advance to management because other people were favored more than myself. I am capable of building bikes and barbeques at a fast pace. I am very knowledgable in games and computers and the new types of TV's. Fun to work with a lot of people but unfortunatley some were liked more than others. Some of the managers were cool to work with but few that no longer work there never did their job right. If I can, I would love to return to work at Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Fresno, CA",1/4/18,2018,1,4
It's a decent job.,"Friendly people to work with, but not much incentive for a temp to stay unless a full-time opening comes up fast. If you can make it to 90 days as a temp you get an employee discount card.",4,Current Employee,Fraud Prevention Specialist ,"Bentonville, AR",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Overall management was my biggest issue,The manager over the cashiers was horrible. She would always wait until last minute to make your schedule. There were some instances where the schedule would come out but you were not scheduled. She never made time to make the schedule. Most of the time other managers would have to do it for her.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Hendersonville, TN",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Lowest pay ever,"Working as a CSM at Wal-Mart taught me a lot about managing employess but, the pay was way to low for any management especially when considering it was $8.50 an hour and you are the one face to face with any all complaints and are responsible for resolving them all.",5,Former Employee,CSM Customer Service Manager ,"Winfield, KS",1/4/18,2018,1,4

Very fast paced,It is a fast paced environment and the managers I had worked with me with getting certain day off that I needed for medical reasons. It may depend on the manager but I think over all they can be accommodating. And depending on the crew you work with they are fairly friendly.,4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Lamoine, ME",1/4/18,2018,1,4
Over worked underpaid,Wal-mart was one of the worst work experiences i had in my life. Managers played favorites to other managers. Regardless of how hard you work or the know how you have for something if you aren't the managers bf you are not getting promoted. They definitely do not give you enough time to grieve when there is a death in the family. Three days of bereavement is not enough time in my opinion.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"San Diego, CA",1/4/18,2018,1,4

Good people.. Not good management,"I have been with this company for almost ten months. I was supposed to be hired on full time, was working 40 hours a week. When it came time to enroll for benefits I was unable to, when i asked why I was told it's because I'm part time. They then said that you have to work full time hours for 12 weeks in a row to be bumped from full time to part time. I was on week 11, the next week they cut me down to 30 hours and I was unable to receive full time status or benefits. They then kept my hours low until around christmas where I began averaging 34 hours a week, and then they would ask me to stay for overtime, with no overtime pay until i reached 40 hours. It is now. In this time frame we received a bonus, but because i was ""technically part-time"" I only received $16 out of almost $400 of the bonus. NOW it is after the holidays and hours are cut even more, with the average being about 30 hours a week and dropping... Anyways what I'm trying to say is unless you find a place with good management that won't screw you over I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!

It is a career building company that offers promotion in several areas. You can further your education if desired and Wal-Mart has a scholarship program to help with that. There is not to many companies that provide this for their assocates, to move forward with their career with Wal-Mart or to move into another field.

"Productive Work place, poor management and communication","While Wal-Mart has a good and productive work place, the managers and supervisors can be very rude and try to be competitive with one another. I don’t recommend applying for the job unless you can hold your temper to the managers and supervisors. Not all of the managers and supervisors are ridiculously rude. However, in Wal-Mart #1035, the store manager is very un-qualified for there position and while they may try to keep the store in perfect shape and make it presentable to the public, they didn’t  grasp the full responsibility of their position. A manager is supposed to listen to his/her employees and keep charge of making sure everyone did there job as intended. Communication is a big error in the company because hardly any member of management would listen to there employees and some managers and supervisors would have you do something completely different from your job so they could say there Department was being productive when in actuality they had you do there job for them. This may be how chain of command works at Wal-Mart, but not to me. Each and every person has a responsibility in there position and that’s how it should be.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Spartanburg, SC",1/4/18,2018,1,4

Great company if you work at the right store.,Overall a good company. Management can be very good or very bad. Good benefits if you work the right amount of hours. Always read the fine print. You must earn all PTO and use it before the end of the calendar year. They do not care about your personal life and will make you work around their schedule and change it without notifying you. It is nearly impossible to have a life outside of work.

Walmart doesn't care about employees,Poor managment. Assistant manager talked to us like a dog. People walked out and quit or cried after speaking with her.

"I miss the job, not the company.",one of the issues with working for Walmart I found most challenging was a lack of teamwork and unity amongst its employees.

It was ok.,I had to come in at 10 pm each night and take loads of boxes off of pallets in the coolers of the frozen and dairy sections. I then would have to put the boxes in sections depending on what and where the item belonged. After that we would stock the shelves. I learned about the circulation process of products such as dairy. Management were friendly and for the most part would listen to what was requested and would then try to help the employee as best as they could. Pretty hard working people trying to get their jobs done like everybody else. Hardest part of the job was easily my back. Also being in a cooler for 3 hours moving packages every single day gets to a person.

Becareful Working There,"WalMart prides themselves on being family orientented, but in my experience it was far from it. When I was working there I worked a shift that was perfect for me, during the hours that my daughter was in school, didnt have to worry about a baby sitter or anything. After 8 months of working there I was let go because I wouldnt open up my availability and change my shift to fit their needs. I was an outstanding employee, didnt miss any work and was never late.

New customer care program doesnt benifit employers.,When I first got hired at Walmart I was working 33 hours maximum 28 minimum. When they adopted the new customer care program it totally wrong to the employees. I went from 30 + hours to 13 hours and there is no fixing it in the computer because the computer was the way it is. Very little or no help from management they were just as frustrated too they were only allowed to fix so many things and we're not allowed to fix other things. Therefore I had no funds to pay my bills things are being shut off and I needed to go where I could work. They don't accept doctors notes Sedwick takes forever to compensate your points. I don't understand why Walmart would do this to their employees nobody will ever work full time unless you're grandfathered in or work in the warehouse or on the docks. It's supposed to be about the customers but the customers are mad too and because the employees aren't happy so they can't give good customer quality,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Warsaw, MO",1/2/18,2018,1,2

The job wasn't hard at all and my co workers were fine that's also another reason i staid before termination. I can say management there wasn't all that good. Had some managers that didn't really try to work with you and some that did. I didn't really like the point system do the fact that you only had 4 points within a six month span . But all in all i'll recommend people to work there as a great start up job, but if you have a high tolerance for ignorance in some of the managers you can possibly make a career out of it.",5,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Colonial Heights, VA",1/2/18,2018,1,2

"Can be stressful, but overall great job/career.","The hardest part is when cashiers call out or when customer service managers send too many cashiers on break at the same time, you have to work 10x as hard and your line gets backed up. Holidays are VERY stressful. It's hard remembering all the codes at first & the Rockmart store doesn't have computer registers so it's harder to learn. Coworkers become family. My store manager was amazing. Bonuses every 3 months. Raises every year. Some customers are really great & friendly. Alot of customers shop lift & cashiers can't say anything to them or do anything about it. Point system is stupid, can't use doctor notes. They have options for advancement but you have to have open availability and they'll work you constantly.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rockmart, GA",1/2/18,2018,1,2

good learning experience,Walmart is a good place to work. I learned many thing working at walmart's pharmacy for example medication names what the medications are used for and so on. Working at walmart even helped me in school for my nursing major.

Terrible company to work for,"Worst job ever. Management is incompetent and doesn't understand we are people too. The only thing that has been good is the hours I work but they hang that over my head as a threat to change it if I don't get something done.

GO ME!",1,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Peoria, AZ",12/31/17,2017,12,31
I wouldn't recommend Wal-Mart to someone who is looking for a job.,At Walmart you would be forced to complete things at a fast pace even if there wasn't a full team on the clock that day. The managers would not treat you like people. If you were sick and came in there was almost a 0% chance that you could go home. They would say that you could change your position in the store but if you signed up for CAP2 there was no chance that you were going to leave that position. They also said that CAP2 was the best place to be noticed to move up to supervisor but I personally think that was a lie. They didn't tell you that you would have to complete an online training course to make more money. You would start out at $9.00 but you have to complete that online training to make the $10.00 you were promised at the interview. Overall Walmart is not a company that you would want to work for.,1,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Strongsville, OH",12/31/17,2017,12,31

Work,"A typical day at Walmart is chill depending on what time of the year it is. I learned that you have to pace yourself and dont overwhelm yourself if alot of put on you.

I learned that its better to stay away from drama and that work is always work. Management is very understanding and very pleasant to be around.

"Great job, if you're out of high school, nothing more","Summary pretty much says it. Low pay, poor management, NO OVERTIME unless the company magically approves it. You get overtime that's unapproved, you are punished, regardless of if you meant to get overtime or not. Scheduling sucks, you have to check every week if you have the same days off cause they will switch it up on you with no notice. People will call out and if you're good at stocking and get good times, they will put you in a foreign and sometimes poor territory. During inventory week or when ""big-wigs"" are in the area, you MUST stay late and face the store while they let most the people with overtime leave. Then you get overtime are rushed to finish your area the next night so you can leave and that's if they let you.

Terrible place to work. Wouldn’t recommend,Management do not know what they’re doing more than half the time and only care about the front end during holidays for their bonus. Unfairly treats employees but then tries to lie when you call a manger above them outside of the store. They change policy’s as they see fit and don’t give us any warning until an issue is engaged with a customer. Do not stick up for their employees at all.

Good Job to get work experience,"This was a great first job to get experience. However, there was a lot of frustration that came with it regarding management's unrealistic views and expectations. They expected you to be able to perform a department manager's job even if you were just a new hire or entry level position. But, there was a lot of stuff you got to learn if you were willing to advance in a position. Another drawback was most associates don't stick around because they just want to laze around and not work. Walmart is a job where it is very fast-paced and the will work you for your money. This is not a job for lazy people or people who physically are not capable of lifting, bending, and kneeling, and climbing.",3,Former Employee,Grocery Stocker ,"Hurricane, UT",12/31/17,2017,12,31
Kept me busy and managers tried to work with me,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Walmart. I learned fast for my job duty. I learned you have to watch people carefully due to high risk of theft.

Decent option if you need to get a job,"Walmart is a good option if you really need a job. The company hires all sorts of different people. If you are applying as a cashier it can be difficult to become full time if you want to. At my location I was the only full time cashier that worked til close. I was able to find good friends among other employees. The store is open most holidays which can be frustrating if you want to spend holiday time somewhere else. The attendance and PTO policies are strange and confusing. New employees have to complete training procedures on the computer which I didn't believe properly taught cashiers how to use the register. The wages are a bit low but the particular store I was employed at offered higher wages than most other Walmarts and the local Target store. At my particular location a lot of equipment such as the registers, the card readers and the self checkouts were slow or faulty all together. The equipment would rarely get fixed or stay fixed. This was very annoying when I need that equipment in order to do my job. The store can become very busy and it can be stressful if you're not prepared for that. As with any customer service or retail job customers can be very rude but it's worse at Walmart stores and my particular store had a reputation for the worst customers. I actually had a customer threaten to beat me up and my manager got spit on by the same customer.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Saint Paul, MN",12/30/17,2017,12,30

Not for everybody -Especially me,"The work that I did was freight unloading. The backroom was always a mess when we started in the afternoon. And pressure was always heavy to hurry and get everything done even though the first hour or more was cleaning up messes left by others overnight and in the morning. The work itself was hard, which I didn't mind. But it was also poorly organized for quick unloading and movement of freight to the floor. We were often short people. My manger was fine, and so were a couple of others. But several seemed to think screeching at people is the right way to get things done. I finally left when the backroom lead quit and one of the other managers came in and started threatening people's jobs and everything else to get everything done when we had been moving at the usual pace even after the lead quit. In fact, most of the people there didn't know the lead quit until they wondered why they were being threatened. A lot of workers in other departments didn't seem to be much happier. Most of them acted more resigned to putting up with abuse than actually enjoying what they were doing. They told me when I started to give them 6 months before making up my mind. That's what I gave them, then left.",3,Former Employee,CAP2 Associate ,"Kansas City, MO",12/30/17,2017,12,30
Flexible fast-paced environment,"I've been with this company for nearly 3 years and the biggest complaint I have is about the attendance system. It takes way too long for the points to ""fall off."" These points also count against you when you try to move up within the company, so you could be an extremely hard worker, but if you've been absent or late for any reason too many times in a 6 month period then you will be passed over for promotions. I do the work of a manager but I am not allowed to advance and have been passed over multiple times, but I am still expected to do management work without the pay grade.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Montgomery, AL",12/30/17,2017,12,30

"Stressful but rewarding, Expect Long hours and Transient Management","Typical day at work starts an hour before scheduled time and often an hour afterwards. High expectations about work quality (e.g. Max. 4 errors/yr).

Favortism and Laziness,"I can't speak for all Walmarts... but the management at the one I worked at was AWFUL. They would stand around talking or just not even be on the floor when an associate needed help with a customer. And it's very obvious managers play favorites. They talk to each other on Snapchat / Facebook, a line that should never be crossed to be honest. It doesn't matter how hard you work. It's just a matter of how much they like you. Oh, and if you're sick and need to be out for a few days, sucks to be you. They don't excuse doctors notes.

Liars and bad management,"Management was known for only advancing and helping those who were out of work friends. They constantly lied and used graphs for months against employees for production, even when they were on Leave of Absence or any type of leave, as it did not actually specify days, and they refuse to show that. Management always told you one thing, and than threw employees under the bus by stating they never said it, requests for trying to get what was said in writing were ignored. They were the best at smiling to your face, but treating you like bad while doing so. We always got paid less than other companies for what we did. Walmart is a pro at telling everyone bad news, and trying to convince them its good for them. HR always sides with management and if you contest anything, they only refer you to talk to the same management that you have the issue with. The company refuses to actually help associates. The only good thing is the culture, as it is interesting and very wide spread.",1,Former Employee,Disputes Specialist ,"Bentonville, AR",12/28/17,2017,12,28

Management sucks there,"I worked there for 3 years and it wasn't all bad. Management however, is horrible. No one is ever on the same page, (upper to lower management) one manager would tell you to do one thing and the other would say that's wrong, and you would get fussed at for doing what the other manager told you. They definitely played favorites and didn't want to help you. I worked in customer service so I needed them a lot more than the cashiers and other associates. THERE ARE SOME GOOD MANAGERS THERE WHO KNOW HOW TO GET THE JOB DONE. _x000D__x000D_The pay is really good and so where the hours. It got a little hectic during the off season cause you would be busy but only have 3 people scheduled the whole day; an opener, mid-shift, and a closer.

somewhat stressfull,"Walmart was a good place to be employed. I did not agree with everything that Walmart did, but they treated me very well. The pay raises were far and few in between.

Started off good but management changed for the worse,"Was a decent job when I started out switched a to a few different areas and was making decent money at the time. Was always a hard worker the managers would agree. I would say 9 out of 10 managers there were good when I started. But do to rotation and other places paying more for managers we lost most of our good ones. When I left I would say there was probably only 3 good managers.

Unrealistic Expectations,"The team I was on was supposed to have 14-16 people, usually operated with 7-10. Fully expected to get everything done with far fewer people than we are supposed to be given, and we were punished when we couldn't complete the tasks. All I learned from this position was that working on a team is a terrible idea at walmart, since they hire just about anybody who's willing to walk through the door. 3-4 good workers would get disciplinary action taken against them for the actions of the whole team, and when said workers went to management about the people in question, asking for something to be done, nothing would be done about it, and those willing to actually work eventually got fired or quit.",3,Former Employee,Cap team 2 ,"Kewanee, IL",12/27/17,2017,12,27

Great pay,"Personally, my job at walmart was not the best job, but the pay made up for that. It was worth getting up and going to work everyday.

The job however wasn't the worst place to work at.",4,Former Employee,Deli Worker ,"Denton, TX",12/26/17,2017,12,26
hate,it was fun and a nice place to work at when i first started but as i got to see what it was really like and how management talk to you yea they say its like family but it is really not i hate it i didn't want to be at work sometimes and i'm a hard worker but that place make you stress out,2,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Saint Petersburg, FL",12/26/17,2017,12,26
"Poor management, Very fast paced and cut throat with very unrealistic expectations and production goals","This place seems to be a great place to work ON PAPER! it has competitive pay, multiple work shifts, good benefits, 401k, stock options,  health vision and dental insurance.  BUT!!!!! Working at this place for 10 years I can only compare it to a prison. They don't care about you or anything els but NUMBERS and how much of a bonus you can get them.  You are just a number to them.  The managers are poorly trained, and don't care at all about their associates.  They are too busy worrying about themselves and watching their own back to help you out.  If you are looking for a place to advance and move up,  good luck! They play favoritism and pick and choose who they want to advance, rather giving everyone a fair chance. On top of that,  they would much rather hire someone out of house who has a two year degree with no managerial or warehouse experience; someone that has manager experience at mcdonals or marshals; or someone just coming out of the military for a manager position instead of promoting someone in house who already knows the job and has years of experience. Furthermore,  Wal-Mart answers to no one! They are not unionized,  so they do what they want, how they want and when they want.  They will enforce or not enforce rules and policies to fit as they need.  Again,  they do not care about you.  You are just a number to them.  They will fire you and hire someone else and pay them less.  That place is a revolving door.   Their extremely high expectations and production goals are unrealistic. They expect you to hit high numbers,  even if those numbers are not there to hit. - more...",1,Current Employee,Receiving Unloader ,"Sealy, TX",12/26/17,2017,12,26

Overall it's a good first job to have.,Managers were not very interested in the needs and obstacles in the way of associates.

Depends on your store.,"Walmart isn't a terrible company to work in, it's just a matter of what store you're working in and where. I was fortunate, and yet, unfortunate enoough to end up working in a new store. This means there was a lot of test runs happening for this store when it came to the change of seasons and holidays. Add that to constant switches in management, management and supervisors constantly quitting and being switched to different stores, and the lack of communication in the store, and you get one big mess. Things weren't terrible, but they could've been much better. Other Walmarts that I've shopped in seem to have happier, more put together staff and management in their stores.

Hectic and non-productive workplace.,If you are planning to become a department manager I suggest you change your mind and run as far away as you can.

Each one of these managers could discipline me as they saw fit, and it was incredibly hard to remain on nine people's good side! _x000D__x000D_Walmart does have an ""open door"" system that allows associates to escalate their concerns if they feel they are being treated unfairly, but I found that it never helped and really just made me a bigger target. _x000D__x000D_I genuinely cared about my work and my associates and fought to protect them whenever possible.

Management only cared about building themselves up,"Walmart says its a family based company but in reality at least at the store i worked it was all about who can i run over to get myself better, as a parent with small children if emergencies came up with them or a death in the family management treated it as if you were stealing from their pocket if you had to take the day off. My son had to have emergency surgery and i was out for several days i get demoted from my position even knowing the situation.",1,Former Employee,Walmart Cap 1 Supervisor ,"Clovis, NM",12/19/17,2017,12,19

Do NOT work here!,"When I first started working for the company, all of the managers seemed positive, nice, and friendly. Then, after I'd been working for a couple weeks, I realized that it was just a front and once you had started the job, they didn't care about being nice anymore. They yell at you constantly, no matter how hard you are working. Nothing is ever good enough for them. The harder you work and the more you give, the more they expect out of you. They make you stay after (and accumulate overtime) and then make you leave early to cut your overtime at the end of the week. (Pretty sure that's illegal, but I'm not sure.) The managers do NOT care about your personal life or about you as a person, they care about getting a job done, money, and their bottom line. Horrible work environment. Started looking for a new job after one month of working here.

To many chiefs not enough indians,Working at walmart was pretty competitive with other employees for advancement.

"One worker, Five Jobs","Management would expressly state that they expected one person to do the work of five in order to keep crew size low. Many women I worked with had children they never got to see, and were never put forth for promotion in order to keep them at part time so they would not have to be provided benefits. Many coworkers had to get a second job just to stay afloat. Heat exhaustion from having workers pushing carts outside for an extended period of time was common.

Don't get me wrong walmart is not a bad job but I gets BUSY._x000D__x000D_When I got called in for an interview they said it was for a Cashier position, when I got there they offered me a job as a Self Checkout Host. I thought to myself ""awesome this is going to be a super easy job, I just stand there and watch people checkout"" well I don't know if I just never has shopped at walmart during the busy hours or maybe it was because I was never a person who had the urge to shoplift but I was wrong. This job is crazy. You get people who don't know what self checkout is trying to get you to scan their items for you, you constantly have people shoplifting. You are not allowed to leave self checkouts unattended but CSM's are impossible to get a hold of (even when you can see them just standing around talking. The self checkout machines break all the the time (or they run out of money)._x000D__x000D_But if you can survive all of that is not really that bad of a job. The coworkers and pay are what make that job work it. The breaks are a plus too (just don't except to get your breaks on time).",3,Former Employee,Self Checkout Host ,"Springfield, MO",12/18/17,2017,12,18

Management is there to help you in anyway they can, though sometimes lack of communication makes it difficult. The culture of the workplace is friendly, though at times can be demoralizing. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a good attitude during stressful times of the year. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding a customer exactly what they need and sending them on their way with a good experience.",3,Current Employee,DEPARTMENT MANAGER ,"Helena, MT",12/17/17,2017,12,17

There is no culture, everyone just does their job and goes home. The hardest part of the job is in the middle of winter if you are on maintenance because you have to go outside and get carts that it specifically says in big red letters in the handbook you are not supposed to do on overnights. The most enjoyable part of the job was making fun of how ignorant the managers are with other associates. New policies every few months, 2% raise once a year.

Productive and a great place to work.,"Walmart was a very great place to work for me, pros are that it was laid back, not to hard of work, people are nice(some) cons are that some managers shouldn't be managing, they use favoritism a lot, at least the ones I had. Don't get me wrong, there are a few managers that work there that I love, but some I dislike as well. Deli was a lot different from overnight. Deli, you barely ever get your breaks, get a lunch on your 6th hour, super fast faced, sometimes short handed. Unlike overnights, set breaks every 2 hours, lunch on time, slow paced, not short handed.

Fast paced and extremely physical workplace,Walmart Distribution is a warehouse that is climate controlled so it is unlike many warehouse environments. It is however very physically demanding and is not suitable for everyone. They have high expectations of their employees when it comes to attendance and production. The hardest part of my job is the heavy lifting and being on my feet on concrete floors for 12 hours a day. This is why I say it is not for everybody.

It was nice working place,It was a great place to work just wished that there was more hours that I was able to get  in a week time but other then that I didn't really have a problem.

There is a lot better out there,"Management did not care about the staff & a lot of the time the store it self. Pretty much all the associates are part time with little to no chance of getting a FT position. The hours are erratic split up in such a way that it makes it extremely difficult to get a needed 2nd job. You may get 30 hours a week but some days you will work 5 hours other days only 3. As soon as they would find out that you have or are even looking for a 2nd job, you are immediately dropped from the schedule, or they cut you hours down to less that 10 - 20 a week & will spread those out over 5 days & various shifts with no consistency.

Inflexible,"Typical day would include clocking in, reviewing orders, speaking with management and preforming straightening and facing shelves. I taught myself the inventory, layaway, and instore pick up processes. Management was inconsistent. Workplace culture was depressing. Often scheduled to work a six hour shift with no lunch break and told to clock out before the shift reached six hours so you would not be required to clock out for a lunch. If you did not clock out you were penalized for not taking a lunch. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. Hardest part of the job was never seeing my family due to evening shift.

Its a job...,"I was hired as a sales associate back in 2007 so I'm sure things have changed so I'll give a review on my experience. I was hired part-time and worked from 3pm to 10pm 5 days a week (no particular order).

The work itself is not hard at all but you can be burdened with a workload if your fellow associates are always on break and not doing their share (those who smoke were allowed more breaks than those who don't smoke). Only true complaint I had was I  constantly had hurting feet from standing so long and walking all over the store because when one manager gives you a task another manager comes along and tells you to go do something else it was like a tug of war some days!",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Selma, AL",12/14/17,2017,12,14

Its an okay place to work for.,Some positions were more fair than others. The work made the day go by extremely fast. However policies changed in my time there along with management and demands became rediculous. Management will literally kiss your rear until your no longer useful. My coworkers were a steady mix of great and just plain dead weight. Work at times got stressful due to demands. Hours were great and steady everyday same times which is one of the best perks a job can offer. The pay was great at first and is very competitive to keep employees there. The longer you are with them the more benefits you recieve. If you can handle the job I would say it is for you  if you can't handle a decent work load don't waste your time.

my experience,"Walmart uses a point system that is integrated with your sick time which I highly disagree with because in the event of an emergency, if one does not have ""points"" then a person would be conflicted with taking care of ones health or going to work.  They also pay the unloaders terrible.  10 dollars an hour to do back breaking work while people in the front on cash registers in customer service make about 12 dollars.  Even a deli associates are making more than the people who are the reason why the store has product to move.  I was told I couldn't leave my position because I was A: good at it and B: they needed to find someone to fill my position.  I waited 3 long months and it appeared that no one even remembered my request, so I put in for a transfer and still nothing.  I was told so many different excuses before another employee and myself just found other jobs and left.  They won't give out overtime and you're technically working a 9 hour shift, you just get a 1 hour break.  Also, you can't have the PTO you worked so hard for if you don't stay for a year, so it's practically worthless unless you plan on staying a while.  Also, my raise was only 18 cents.  It's a shame how employees are paid and treated.",2,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Mishawaka, IN",12/14/17,2017,12,14

stressful long hours with minimal positive reinforcement,days were 14 hours plus and many incompetent personnel occupied the floor.

Results were sometimes unreasonably expected and the building was well beyond its capacity which was unsafe but not focused on. The hardest part of the job was the 14 plus hour days.

Easy yet stressful place to work.,"Walmart recognized my hard work and rewarded me with full time and benefits. There are are days that salaried management get frustrated and take out frustration on hourly associates, especially during the holidays (black friday, christmas, etc.), Hardest part is when certain managers build a trust with particular associates and rely on them individually to do the work of three or more associates.

I enjoyed working here,I liked my position at Walmart but I didn't like working overnight. I could have applied to work day hours but I wasn't willing to lose the $1 extra pay I received from working the overnight shift. I thought the management team was great to work with.

If you have a pulse, You can work here with a stable job._x000D__x000D_Management: Absolutely worthless. Upper management hides out in the back and never shows up half the time.

Overall for Walmart in general, I really love the fact that when I was working they had their own ""debit"" card so I could have some of my check go to the card and the rest in a bank account or wherever. This really helped manage my funds. The discount isn't bad, especially considering that you will most likely spend most of your check at work.

Based on that we would find things that would need to be stocked. See whats on the shelves and we we need to order. I learned some very good communication skills. Asking questions can never hurt you. When I started out, I had a hard time assisting customers with finding certain items but as time went on I learned the store inside and out with the help of asking my co workers for help we all learned where things were together because that specific shift is a team. We were the CAP Team 1 so we had to collectively stock the store whether we were in the same department or not. The workplace is very diverse in culture.

It helped me with my communication skills, be more social and meet new friends. They made the job tolerable for the job as a whole was stressful. The job itself wasn't hard but the standards/expectations that management wanted from us was insane. As in, they required us to unload the truck in maybe 2 hours or less but we can't do that when we have so little people to work with. The people on your team sometimes vary since not everyone have the same work days but work the same hours nonetheless from 2 to 11 pm. You find yourself getting a workout from moving so much, pushing, pulling and lifting items constantly because of that deadline. I lost weight doing this job.

ok but could be better,"Walmart on TV is nothing like the actual store. Maybe it could've been just the one I worked at. Too many managers and Assistant managers trying to fight for overall authority. As a truck unloader I was lied to about starting pay. I was making the same amount as a cash register associate but worked 4x harder than anyone on the floor. Not to toot my own horn but theres no way anybody should work that hard and receive no recognition, a raise, or even a simple balanced work schedule without all of the managers complaining or threatening to fire you. One more thing. The store owner supposedly was a nice guy that you can come and talk to yet he was hardly in the store. No one including other managers could ever reach him. I honestly felt that i had no one to go to talk about the extreme working conditions. I wouldn't recommend making Walmart a career.

There are days when customer can be a challenge but then again the most rewarding feeling is overcoming a challenging and knowing that you helped a customers out.

Okay place to work,"It was easy to get the job here. I was apprehensive about working overnights and doing schooling at first but has been working out for me so far. The only down side to working here was the management. Some just had a bone for scolding employees for small things that aren't even scolding worthy.

Pay is better than fast foods, and gets better the longer you work there! Eventually, leaving can be hard, as other retail will have hard time matching, but will take years to get there! You get benefits even at part time, some paid holidays, some paid time off, and some benefits, not a lot, but better than TARGET for sure!

The only thing that would get to me is when I would come in to work and find that there was far more work then the previous day and it kept seeming to stack up as if the other shifts didn't do anything.

Good introductory job,Working in big box retail is an acquired taste. You either learn to love it or grow to hate it. Several departments and positions would lead you to believe there’s lots of room to grow and move up but that isn’t always the case. Cross training in other departments isn’t utilized enough so when you apply for an open position in other departments you are on the same level as outside applicants because of “no experience” especially when it comes to management.,2,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Rogers, AR",12/5/17,2017,12,5

"Work hard, there is room to grow here","Constant moving of product to sales floor-Most days you will feel like a donkey dragging product to sales floor day in and day out!

Pay is better than fast foods, and gets better the longer you work there!  Eventually, leaving can be hard, as other retail will have hard time matching, but will take years to get there!  You get benefits even at part time, some paid holidays, some paid time off, and some benefits, not a lot, but better than TARGET for sure!  Customers are on lower end of wage scales, education and hygiene.  Stealing seems to be a full time job for most and frustrating for store employees to witness hourly!

Incredibly stressful but worth the money,"A typical day consisted of running the register for several hours, interacting with hundreds of customers, and carefully conducting transactions. The management was decent, though I don't believe that there were always enough managers on duty. I quickly learned to be patient with customers, and I mastered the 'customer service' voice and facial expressions. I perceived the workplace culture as tense, but somewhat positive. The most difficult part of the job were the long hours on my feet, rude customers, and frequently finding myself covered in mysterious sticky substances. On the other hand, the most enjoyable parts of the job were the pay, and frequent interactions with my coworkers.

"Stressful, unorganised, unprofesianal, and drama filled",I loved my job at first but then I started to see favoritism and unprofessionalism. My electronics manager only cared about gossip and having her friends come up to the store so she could talk instead of working. Managers talked to you like you were stupid and work you as hard as they can so they don't have to do the work.

It's a great place to work if you want to learn about the business world and how cut throat it can be.

Management has been a rollercoaster for the past year, and recently there's been ridiculous changes in production standards. Not only did they make weekly quotas more than 5x harder to meet, but they count ""down time"" (cleaning from the shift before, setting up, changing batteries, broken stuff, entire trailers full of broken stuff, entire trailers full of a hurricane of things that are non-palletable and TAKE FOREVER TO FINISH) against you. I was let go last month, as well as several others because of this. Most employees there now have been there less than six months, so the quotas they have to meet are still in easy mode. I was there for almost 2 years and outlasted almost every one of my original coworkers.

The managers running it is highly biased towards certain individuals and is extreamly a sneaky to everyone. They writes up only people they dont like, and others get off. Makes up rules that walmart would never allow. Dont get me started on the pay, the shipping side employees get paid more than a registered pharmacy texhnician. And from what i know the supervisors get paid not even a dollar more than regular pharmacy technicians. Where do they get these managers? Smh. The central pharmacy needs a major change, but we all know it's harder to change behavioral characteristics. So that means you better not be on their bad side if you work there.

The managers take a very long time assisting you when you call for help. Walmart believes the customers when they lie on employees just to get a gift card.,1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Lake City, FL",11/30/17,2017,11,30

"productive,hard working workplace.",a typical day at work was a day of just showing up and doing my job without being bothered. i learned how to keep things organized and cleaned. Both my department manager and assistant manager were the two best managers there. The workplace culture was not bad ut was not the best either. I can say that the good really only came along as long as i kept dong my job and respected my higher ups and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was making sure i did not get into any trouble with the managers that were watching me and the ones watching me were not even the managers i worked for.The most enjoyable part was to hang out with my co-workers that worked in the same department as i did.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Florida,11/30/17,2017,11,30

Every Store is Different,"You cant really base your decisions to work at walmart based on reviews. every store is different, management is different, and the operation of each store is different. you would have to take to employees at the store you wish to work at to get an idea of what to expect. Pay is good. a typical day depends on customers, time of day and time of year.",4,Current Employee,Order Fulfilment Associate ,"Conway, AR",11/30/17,2017,11,30
Difficult Environment,Depending on the position that you are in the typical work day can change. My most recent position at Wal~Mart was a sales floor associate so the typical job duties were to pull inventory from back room bins and place it on the shelves in the appropriate department. Always making sure that the area is neat and clean and organized. I learned a great deal from working at Wal~Mart this job gave me the majority of my retail work experience. Unfortunately. management at my particular store was the reason that I left. The store manager refused to get on board with Company wide changes and assistant managers could not control their department managers and the department managers left their work for others to do. The hardest part of the job was being good at your job because it meant you did everyone else's job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to complete a task.,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Poulsbo, WA",11/30/17,2017,11,30
