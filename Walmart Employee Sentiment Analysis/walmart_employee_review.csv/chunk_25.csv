11 year driver,"Would be nice if they didnt just screw the more senoir drivers than me over. People that have been home every day for years making 90k+ a year being told theyd have to sleep in a truck again hasnt gone over well. That being said its still a great paying job, holidays are always crazy, and 34 days a year is hard to leave. Much respect all around, were the best of the best so they say. Do your job, kinda set your own hours as well. Seems lately the Save Money Live Better moniker only applies to corporate lining their own pockets and defeating Amazon which will never happen. Great gig but after years of being here in hindsight its always been take take take from employees. Im on the hunt for a new job tho ill stick it out til i do. End of the day for a driver here as long as me i still make bank, but theyve taken every incentive away for new drivers to want to drive here....enter the rookies with attitudes that are no better than Swift drivers constantly tearing equipment up.

Managers,"At Wal-Mart, the managers will do things and blame it on you just to cover themselves. I've seen a lot of people come and go in my short time there due to their managers giving them a schedule to follow and the system sets them another (but them telling you to listen to them). It was really chaotic working there!",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Person ,Replenish shelves,11/29/17,2017,11,29

"Hostile work environment, unfair treatment &","A typical day at work for me is very structured. I have specific instructions to follow and am allowed a certain amount of time to complete tasks. At Walmart I learned how to work at a fast pace, and stay focused on the task at hand. The management at my store isn't terrible. However, there are some people in management that act very unprofessional, and don't always do the right thing. _x000D_The hardest part of the job is dealing with the work environment. There is virtually no professionalism, and it is not uncommon for people to be blatantly rude. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my team. I enjoy and respect everyone on my team and I love working with them. However, I would never recommend Walmart as a place of employment. I believe there is something far better for everyone.",2,Current Employee,Receiving handler ,"Kalamazoo, MI",11/29/17,2017,11,29

Managable if you just want to work,"If you just wanted to work for a paycheck, walmart was a good idea but if you wanted to be able to have a place where you enjoyed working or that you were hopeful for advancement/raises, i wouldnt suggest it. they do raise people to higher ranks fairly quickly but that is mostly because they had a high turn over rate. the stress alone of constantly going through management people was that everyone had their own opinions on how things were to be ran and no one ever communicated from the different ranks. too many chiefs, not enough indians i noticed. gosh forbid you get hurt at work or a diagnosis they dont like(like Cancer) as they will find a way to not be liable for anything but if they do admit fault or negligence of some form, they will do what they can to fix it",3,Former Employee,Grocery Associate ,"Hammond, LA",11/29/17,2017,11,29

"A little stressful, associate lounge was the best part of the job.",In the department I work at it is considered one of the easiest departments to be assigned to.

Management is really professional and courteous especially when it comes to bad situations, shoplifters, and a possible fight about to breakout from conflict or stupidity from alcohol intoxication at a high level or illegal hard core street drugs not to mention undercover security guards and calls to the 5-0's/Police when directed or as needed for further investigation or proto call.

Integrity,"Wal-Mart is a Great company, good pay and benefits; however, not enough full-time positions, and management is a constant issue.Local store management tends to lack integrity in various ways, and this poorly impacts workplace culture and moral.  For example, in my experience, at the location i work at, full-time employment and promotions and excused absences tend to be applied on favoritism basis, not necessarily merit and experience basis.

The task of stocking or zoning was mindless so i had to keep thinking of other things or entertaining myself in various ways to continue with my work. The radio is on an 8-hour loop so i would hear the same songs at the beginning of my shift as the end.,4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Princeton, MN",11/29/17,2017,11,29
Stressful and harsh but open to advancement,"Walmart can be a company you can advance in, but only if you submit yourself to the brutal and disrespectful atmosphere managers push on the associates under them. Your work experience is dictated by far too many things to accurately estimate what YOUR experience will be. Fellow associates, managers, and even neighboring departments can affect how enjoyable or stressful your job can be. However, considering the kind of people they hire regularly just to keep the place running it can take 6 months to a year to finally gather a group of associates worth keeping in your department.",2,Former Employee,Fresh Food Associate ,"Midlothian, VA",11/29/17,2017,11,29
Keeping Up With The Changes,"Walmart is a constant sea of changes and that is for the better.  However, with this change, lots of jobs are affected in that they are eliminated or redifined.

Okay place to work at,It's a decent place to work at. Most of the co-workers are friendly and hardworking. Some of the upfront supervisors can sometimes lack on their job.

Long days but good benefits,"Field Project Supervisor is a traveling job. Traveling is fun but because of being away you tend to work longer hours. You have an opportunity to get a close bond with you team because of being away for so long. You tend to lose track of your work home balance, and your days off don't always line up with normal days off so its hard to hang out with your friends and family when you are home.",4,Current Employee,Field Project Supervisor ,"Indianapolis, IN",11/29/17,2017,11,29

Was nice at first then it quickly changed..,"At the beginning working at Walmart was a pleasant experience but then after a month or two things changed drastically. Co workers were rude and talking about each other, running to management lying on other employees. They cut my hours for two weeks. Hours became ridiculous. Worked every single weekend for 6 months straight, 4 & 9 hour shifts turned strictly into 9 hour shifts so I had no personal life outside of Walmart because I wasn’t getting off until 10 or 11 at night. Management was always in there own little bubbles and never got stuff done when it came to schedules or anything else for that matter. I would say make this a part time job because if you do full time it will drive you crazy and tired, to much stress and repetitive work.",2,Former Employee,Apparel Sales Associate ,"Charlotte, NC",11/29/17,2017,11,29

After I received  my new manager, things went downhill. He had it out for me. Causing me to have more medical issues and extreme stress. I was worn down from each time I reported my manager, it got worse from him. He was trying to build a case to fire me and wasn't succeeding.

Customer based workplace but with employees in mind,"A typical day at work for me was based around customer service, stocking shelves and organizing products, and overall doing what I could to help the appearance of the store. I learned several skills such as how to operate a fork lift and a scissor lift, how to mix paint, and how to process photos. Management was always friendly and hands on, and the workplace was usually filled with employees who got the job done, whatever the job may be. The hardest part of the job was balancing school with my full time hours, but my managers helped me in any way they could.I literally had a great time all the time working at this Walmart, even though I know this review sounds cheesy.",5,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Assembler/Overnight Modular Team ,"Oakdale, LA",11/28/17,2017,11,28

Fast pace productive work enviroment,Management has a meeting with the associates before every shift to assign workers to areas with certain time for the freight that is on the floor to be worked before the shift is over. The hardest part about third shift stocking is time management we have a certain amount of time to finish the freight and have it off of the floor before our customers are back in the store in the morning. Being a GM Stocker I enjoy the feeling of getting the job done with time to clean my area before we open the store to customers in the morning.,3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Charlotte, NC",11/28/17,2017,11,28
I would never go back they only discipline people.,"When I first started I wanted to learn the routine and they told me ""There is no routine just go fast in fact you are wasting time by asking questions"". I was not impressed. If you did not get 10,000 picks done by 12 am we got disciplinary action. That and if we were getting too close to overtime they would make us shave down the time by taking longer breaks and threatened to fire people. I was disgusted by Walmart.",2,Former Employee,Inventory Control Specialist ,"Wadena, MN",11/28/17,2017,11,28

Poor management and lack of advancement,There was a management shift in my store which has caused many problems for employees. Availability is not something that is checked so many of us are scheduled on days and times we cannot work. Our manager constantly yells at and berates associates on the front end not only in front of our peers but in front of customers as well. Associates who are lacking at their job are praised and offered promotions when the ones who bust their butts and try to get promoted are told no or are constantly put down. I have been told twice now that I cannot move up nor can I move to a different department by my department manager. Moral is low and many of us are stuck there because we have bills to pay. Corporate doesn't even listen to our concerns. Policies change day to day. None of the management is ever on the same page about how the store is run. It's just a mess at the store and we all feel like our complaints and concerns go unheard.,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Tucson, AZ",11/28/17,2017,11,28

Great teamwork are two words to express a typical day at work,"Great teamwork are two words to express a typical day at work for me. I learned that completing a task as a whole works better when teamwork is involved. Together, we will reach the mark and reach our main goal. Management was very poor with decision making and showed simply no compassion towards me during the loss of my husband. In result of his sudden death, I lost my job at Walmart due my absences for the planning of his funeral. I loved the urban, up-beat culture. The hardest part of the job was keeping the toy department well  organized during the holiday season. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and answering their questions. A happy customer always makes my job even more happier.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Chicago, IL",11/28/17,2017,11,28
Good and bad things,The good things were some managers were willing to work with you and its a laid back place. Mostly bad things happened. How you were talked down too. Lack of communication. A lot of people dont work there really. They just look like there doing something only a set few would actually work. Plus over 50 people quit the 8 months I was there. Me I was working as much as 3 people I was training people when I wasnt trained my self.

It's Walmart,"I worked at two Walmarts between two states and in several positions (Cart collector, Sporting goods, hardware, domestics, toys, pets, freight, overnight stocking) and the same issues occur between both. Management with limited or no prior retail experience and even less people management skills. Understaffed sections lead to strain with customers, even outright confrontation in some scenarios. No sick pay, vacation pay, or maternity leave (had a child during my time there and time taken off counted against my allowed call-ins for the year). You're almost guaranteed to start at minimum wage unless you work in the deli or electronics. Annual raises are a joke. They claim you can earn up to an extra dollar an hour if you've acquired skills to work in more parts of the store (mixing paint in hardware, making keys in Tire and Lube, etc) but they often fail to recognize these skills and will not allow you to negotiate when time comes for your annual review, so raises tend to be in the 30-40 cents an hour range. Last i heard since I stopped working there, they have even removed the extra dollar an hour you could make by working graveyard. _x000D__x000D_Never work at Walmart unless you have literally no other options, or you have a degree in business management and want to make a salary equivalent to $20 an hour, experience be damned.",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocking Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",11/27/17,2017,11,27

My Walmart review,You punch in. Do your job punch out. I learned how important team work is. The culture is ok.

I had to further confirm which of the three freezers the freight was located when the reply was freezer.  Additionally, I was told to wait for a coworker (who was schedule to show up in 30 minutes) to arrive to assist me, but to start the task immediately.

This has honestly been a horrible experience,Management at this job is a living nightmare. For them to have so many levels of management you would expect them to coordinate and be on the same page but every manager wants to do things differently and it all results in serious issues for the bottom employees.

No go as they had no one to take my place.,3,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Rochester, MN",11/25/17,2017,11,25
Productive and fast-paced,I loved my role at Walmart. I enjoyed working with the other associates and all of the customers. I have always been a frequent shopper of Walmart so I of course loved the discount. They do their best to work with your schedule. If you cant do direct deposit they have their own 'money card type' account they can give you which is extremely convenient. The shift that you work will most likely depend on the work pace.,4,Former Employee,Overnight Cashier/Stocker ,"Powhatan, VA",11/25/17,2017,11,25

A very stressful but well paid place,Walmarts overnight crew can be incredibly stressful  the amount of work you are required to do can be overwhelming and the do not treat employees equally. however the pay is much better then other entry level positions and i do recommend it if you can work overnights and dont mind being stepped on from time to time.,3,Former Employee,Overnight stocker ,"Carson City, NV",11/25/17,2017,11,25
No Advancement from Certain Managers,I do have to say I have been with Walmart for 10+ years and have no way to move up. I have a Bachelor's degree in Business Management and just 1 of 7 managers congratulated me on it and I was not happy.

"It's a job.  If you need somthing to pay the bills, this will work.","Not a great place to work, but it's a job.  I worked in TLE (Tire Lube Express).  Walmart nickles and dimes everyone, including their employees.  As of this writing, ""no overtime"" has been management's catch phrase in the store I work at.  If you work overtime, they make you knock it off on your lunch hour.  Also, they don't pay time and a half on government holidays.",3,Current Employee,TLE Technician ,"Alpharetta, GA",11/25/17,2017,11,25

"Favoritism is real at jet, if ur not in with the managers ur nothing","Once u get up to a decent wage they will fire you. Managers show favoritism. People can start months after you and get promoted faster just because of who they know. U work hard for nothing pretty much. They let me go once I got up to 14$ hourly.

Overall,Walmart is a company with great potential to advance and treat there employees with better pay. I think over the years they've forgotten what there niche is. They've focused so hard on profit that they've dismissed the team in which makes all the sales. Honesty is something I've never felt within the company over the 2-3 years of working there. Over all i think the company itself is a great stepping stone for other job opportunities.,2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Spokane, WA",11/25/17,2017,11,25
Responsiable,A typical day at WalMart is slow in the morning and about noon more customers start coming in so your day isn't slow anymore. I learned to never argue with the customers and some days the management is a great or not so great. The workplace culture might be happy or just ready to get the day over with and the hardest part of the job was when we was busy for the holidays and the most enjoyable part of the job is when it's time to clock out and go home.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Watson, LA",11/25/17,2017,11,25
Walmart Employment,"I worked for Walmart for many years. The first 6 were great. Management was fair and treated you as an employee/person well. We received great benefits. When I had issues medically doing my job they found me a comparable position in the store to move to. When the Management changed is when the store changed. They are not fair to all employees. If you are not someone who brown noses them you will get singled out and treated poorly, especially if you have any sort of medical problem. _x000D__x000D_I had many great managers and I learned so much from them. I learned how to treat customers and employees with respect and compassion. the sad thing is that those managers left, due to unsupportive upper management. I tried to manage as they did, and I was not tough enough. I gained the respect of employees under me and I gained respect for them. They helped out in other areas without fail, but when they would get talked to about doing their job that all went out the window. _x000D__x000D_My most enjoyable part of my job was my customers and my fellow employees.

Working in the work-area I was at, was very hot, sticky, uncomfortable, and sticky. I get hot very fast due to me getting in the ZONE with my work habits. I stay focus until the job is done.

Good management; bad customers,"The pay was not bad for someone in college and working part time, however, there is no amount big enough to pay me to continue to work for Walmart. Many times I was tested by the public and at times, threatened. The people that shop at Walmart have no respect for the employees or people around them in general. It was very difficultly for me to have a positive attitude at Walmart. Many times I was tested when people would come in and try to steal. If i did not catch the items being stolen, they would come back on me and management would get on to me. I did NOT like feeling this way every time I was on the clock. I was always scared of losing my job =, just because people do not want to pay for their things. I knew I did not need to stay with Walmart after witnessing this situation multiple times. I was good at my job and several employees loved me due to my positive attitude, and ability to pick up shifts, however, every night I went home in a bad mood due to the way I was treated by customers, and the way I was spoke to by customers. Again, Walmart is not a company I would ever stay with.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Indianapolis, IN",11/24/17,2017,11,24
"fast paced, enjoyed working with public","I had never held this type of position before, so I am grateful that they took a chance on me. I really liked working with the public, it was fast paced, and a new learning experience. I needed more actual training in some areas, but, since it was the holiday season, it was a learn as you go type position. I was impressed by the store management, because during busy times they were on the registers,helping where needed, and seemed to really care about their employees as well as their customers.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Pendleton, OR",11/24/17,2017,11,24

Productive work environment with an emphasis on safety,"Working at Wal-mart was a good experience, enabling employees to gain meaningful experience in a fast-paced, physical environment. Company policy allows employees time to become accustomed to the physical aspect of the job and will often work with employees who struggle to be proficient in certain job duties. This often results in success and long-term stability for Wal-mart employees.",4,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Loveland, CO",11/24/17,2017,11,24
loved working with my co-workers,"at the beginning of night I would line up 14 grocery carts to ready for processing of apparel, basics and table items. racks were used to hang clothing, overstock was marked and brought to back room and then zoning of tables and walls till shift ended. I learned to organize and plan out my night by the amount of freight that had to be worked. There were nights when I was the only one who worked apparel otherwise I had two other co-workers. Management was changing quite often and it seemed as though every time you turned around there was someone new. The hardest part of working at Walmart was doing the best job you could do and watching others play around, come back from lunch late and just the laziness that I observed. I enjoyed leaving in the morning knowing that I had accomplished a great deal and took pride in my work, I have taken pictures and have an album of areas I zoned.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Worcester, MA",11/24/17,2017,11,24

Not the cream of the crop,Minimum of 50 hrs per week as a manager. Always held over or told to come in on days off to fix problems. Store Mgr. is not a working manager.

Depends on the store....,"Walmart is a good place to work to get a little extra cash. Now that they have changed to customer first scheduling however, it is hard to live off of the salary. They have cut hours and only schedule people four and a half hours a day. Since I live far away, it doesn't make since for me to drive so far for a short shift and such few hours. I've been working at this store for almost 3 years, and the saving grace has been my coworkers. They are the reason I keep going. But now that my hours have been cut, I got a notice that my health insurance is going to be cut at the beginning of the year. Walmart as a company likes to surprise people, and they try to work against you to get the most money out of you.

Again if you have the right management team it's a really good place to work. As an associate I made $10.00 an hour and as a department manager I made $12.50 an hour. And you get pay time off per hours worked. As a full time.e employee I earned 4 hours of paid time off every 2 weeks. And they really try to work with you on days you need off.

Better than you hear,"All Walmart locations are not always the same. The few stores I worked at (started at a Neighborhood Market and ended at a Supercenter) were the best I ever worked and shopped.

"Over all, a great place to work.","The benefits are great, once you qualify for them, just seems near impossible to qualify.  Occasional cliques happen though, which makes things difficult.  There can arise an issue of being too good at your job, which makes promoting out of your current position difficult. Biggest drawbacks I've found is the overly harsh disciplinary system, and some times a lack of appreciation shown towards the employees.  As for the positives, I've actually met some very interesting and engaging people, both fellow associates, and customers.  You feel pride when you finish your tasks, especially when your hard work is acknowledged.

Gets a bad rep,"Before i worked at walmart, i constantly heard of them treating their employees poorly and the shame on walmart situations going on and wondered how bad could it really be? And then i began to work there and, to be completely honest, i saw nothing of what was being said about them. Now, as with every job there is, sometimes remote things happen (manager is buddy buddy with this person, so and so has been here for so long but hasnt been promoted etc etc) but the fact of the matter is, its one of the rare places where as long as you come in, do what needs to be done, which actually usually isnt much unless there are call ins or a holiday is approaching, you are treated and compensated very well and can move up very fast.",4,Former Employee,Bakery Dept Manager ,"Oneida, NY",11/20/17,2017,11,20

However, I do love the challenge of trying to get the job done as quickly and as professionally as possible. The team that I work with (CAP-2) can vary from being a really positive group of people, to them creating a very toxic working environment. Most of the customers brought a very positive attitude with them which made the job very pleasant at times. It helped me gain a new level of patience and confidence in my work.

It’s a great starter job,If you can just focus on your department in Walmart it would have been a piece of cake. They were many times due to the lack on associates on the shift you would get moved around.,4,Former Employee,cashier ,"Valley Stream, NY",11/19/17,2017,11,19

Stressful,"Walmart was very stressful, mainly due to the lack of communication between management. One manager will tell you to do one thing, the next will say something to you for doing it. There was also favoritism. A LOT. There are some associates (management included) that don’t have to work, it’s ok for them to clock in and walk around, Be or their phone, or sit down at the computer; meanwhile I’m the only cashier on register for 2 hours and my line is backed up because it’s so busy, and i didnt receive any help, so along with customers having an attitude with me higher management said it was my fault. Even though it was the csm who was standing around on their phone no where to be found. _x000D__x000D_Also, Lack of pay. I was Trained in customer service and money center. I even Was trained as a customer service manager.

Walmart was a very nice and smooth job and i very much enjoyed it.,"At work we had to unload pallets and locate the merchandise to their homes in the store. After thats done we make sure we place all items on shelves in a organized form. i learned how to work pallet jacks at that job and how to use some of Walmart devices. The only bad thing that i experienced was a rude manager who had it in for me. She didn't act like a manager because she wanted to act as if she was a friend of the coworker. The workplace was quiet and we were allowed to have headphones in, also the workers were very polite and had great customer service. The hardest part was zoning and keeping everything in order. The most enjoyable part is the fun times we all had as a team for everyones birthdays.",5,Former Employee,Over-Night Grocery Stocker ,"West Allis, WI",11/19/17,2017,11,19

Use to be a great company to work for,Walmart is changing everything and making it harder and harder to have a life outside of Walmart they own you if you're a manager you can't leave until things are done you work on your days off. you were there 10 hours or more. They don't care about their people anymore some management tries to protect them but they can't protect them from the district managers and higher-ups they only care about making money. It's nothing like it used to be and it's ruining the company._x000D_People have worked there 15-20 years and they're all leaving they don't care if they make less money the district manager is terminating the employment of all the store managers in one District it's not a safe place to work anymore for your career. Which is sad I would've stayed forever most of the people they've lost management wise really cared about their store and their people it's sad,1,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Goshen, IN",11/19/17,2017,11,19

Staffing process is poor and taking under appreciated.,1,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Harvey, IL",11/19/17,2017,11,19
It pays the bills,"I get enough hours to make sure I can pay the bills I need to pay, I would like more fixed hours so I can spend more time with my family and have time during the day or weekends to have some form of a life. Management isn't that great, you have to tell them multiple times if you need PTO or days off approved and even then it still wont get done. And it really sucks that we have to work major holidays when we could be spending it at home with our families and loved ones instead.",3,Current Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Goodyear, AZ",11/19/17,2017,11,19
Ok,"There were good and bad days but it seems that nobody is on the same page. Too many managers making changes that you will never satisfy their expectations.

walmart,the store manager and the market are the ones who need to get FIRED they DO NOT know how to talk to people. they think of their associates as slaves. they have no respect for the individual. instead of bringing people up and saying positive things they are always putting the associate down and speaking to them not like a human but something less than that.,1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Goose Creek, SC",11/18/17,2017,11,18
The Worst Best Place to Work,"All in all a generally great job. My time with Walmart has been pleasant, however when it comes to aspects of the job other than the tasks themselves things get a little hairy. For example after meeting the qualifications for benefits I was quickly transferred so that my time in the position would negate the potential benefits I needed to get and now no longer receive. The hours I receive are OK, not what I requested to work, as well as not the number of hours I was hired to work, this caused friction between me and my management who just act like nothing happened so all in all its a decently beneficial job if your trying to stay in the same tax bracket doing the same things the rest of your life.",2,Current Employee,Produce Associate ,"Pullman, WA",11/18/17,2017,11,18

I always listen to my customers. They all have different needs and different request.  That's why it is so important to be a listener. Even when they are upset listen for the key words so you can resolve their issues with a resolution. The hardest part of the job for me is when I can't supply what the customer wants in our own location, even though when I have to call another Walmart it is still Walmart when we don't have the item or items.

"Stressful work enviornment with bias management, porr customer service and unrealistic expectations of employees",I expected much more from such a successful company.  Management mislead me into thinking I had a solid chance of moving up the ranks. They were also biased to certain employees and made decision without consulting lower management subordinates. Job culture was stale and employees are given no incentive to help customers as management sees that as a distraction from your job at hand.

He is also very flexible with scheduling hours, and if you needed a day off, he would make it work. He is hard working and doesn't give himself enough credit for how well he does.

They give jobs to do but before you can finish one job they pull you to another then get on to you for not completing the first job. You never really get to stay in your area hired for due to the understaffed decided by corporate office. Schedules are bad due to stores not able to assign work schedules as needed. Associates get upset because schedules can be changed daily and the associate isn't told about it. Schedules must be checked daily since it's your responsibility to show up at your scheduled time.

A general overview of Walmart,"Depending on the department that you work in, the average day consists of stocking and organizing your department. Managers may pull you to assist departments that are short-staffed but most of them stay short-staffed. As long as you stay on task, the work is usually not too overwhelming.

Wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemies,Management is awful and they do not care about their employees the least bit. I was forced to go out almost daily and get carts cause the store could never keep any cart attendants. I live in Florida so sometimes its 90 degree weather outside so to pay someone minimum wage to get carts in that heat is outrageous. I recommend working at Target over Walmart.

Better Than Nothing,"As a sales associate the hardest part of the day was having to deal with customers as well as the list of chores management wanted done by the end of the shift. I often found myself doing tasks that were suppose to be management task as well as overworked in the just the five hours I was there. The workplace was often stressful especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas. The best part of the job was when I was dealing with customers that were really appreciative of the service that I was providing them (trust me many aren't, and act as spoiled children).

"Its a decent place to work, just try different departments","I liked working there, spent some time in almost all the departments.

Good sense of unity within the company,"A typical day at work involves engaging with the customers, cooking the hot case foods and constant cleaning up. Working in the deli and fresh food areas require a food handlers card and knowledge of basic, non-negotiable food safety procedures. Management can be very poorly constructed at times and it can be a hassle for them to find hours that work around your schedule both academically and personally.

Worst place to work,When starting I loved this job but as time goes by you adjust. The meaning to adjust is that managers sometimes have picks and favorites of people that wont get in trouble for coming in late or calling in. They ask you to do things and sometimes you get in trouble for the things that you are doing when another manager tells you that your suppose to be doing something else than this.,2,Former Employee,Stock Associate/Customer Service ,"Mesquite, TX",11/16/17,2017,11,16

Great Place to work,"I love working for Walmart. I work overnights stocking shelves, and my favorite thing is the managers assign what areas you're working, and they leave you alone to do it.

The management team were nice people, but to me they need to learn to compromise with each other and to not really have favorite people. The culture was very diverse like there was a lot of different people. The hardest part was having to do a lot of task in a certain time length.

Poor Management at Certain stores.,"I loved going to work in Virginia (Store 5779) it was nice, everybody was friendly management actually helped you do things. They would genuinely have a conversation with you. It was like they were friends not managers. Which was nice. And then I moved to Oklahoma, and the management basically didn’t know I existed. I worked the garden center in Oklahoma, and my breaks would be hours late even though I would call management and ask for someone to come back so I could have a break. What I mean is my lunch would be scheduled for 5 and my shift would be 1-10. But I wouldn’t get my lunch until 8 o’clock sometimes. That Walmart is the reason I quit. And when I quit they had no idea I was gone, I called in after 2 missed days and they thought I was coming back. Granted I quit after I had called out a Saturday using the Walmart1 app and it never got reported to my store and they thought I no called no showed and discontinued my discount card that day. They never made a phone call to me to see why I didn’t come in or why I didn’t call out. I had no idea the app didn’t notify them as there are glitches in the system sometimes. So basically they had already fired me when I called that day because my card was canceled, and they said “oh we can rehire you!” Some managers just aren’t responsible nor are they caring. If you’re mistreated by management, just leave.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service / Garden Center ,"Norman, OK",11/15/17,2017,11,15

Stressful work envionment where mangement uses bait and switch tactics upon hiring.,"Typically a cashier will be worked as much as they can be when the store is short staffed.  I learned that in order to receive the most hours in this position, you must be willing to be used. Most management is only concerned with their bottom line whether breaks are given or not.

When I asked how to do something and receive more training I was treated like I was stupid. The management team didn't know the basics of locations and treated most employees like they're a nuisance.  I was constantly feeling like I was being set up to fail; They punish you for taking sick days, constantly schedule you for 8+ days in a row even though company policy is that you're not allowed to work more than 6 in a row.

Very Male dominated,"I have been working at Walmart for almost a year. And I learned a lot of problems have been occurred but never be solved. Even though, we, at Walmart, to be train to do it 1-best-way. But rarely, you would see anyone do it. In order to get promotion to full-time, you have to be quite, and no complains to your supervisor if there is any problems occur. And if you do, you would get retaliated with no chance of promotion. Employees are ""plugging"" that what we call. And the ones are working correctly, never get promote, and cutting hour, and no chance of transferring to another stores. That's the reality, working at this Walmart for me.",3,Current Employee,CAP 2 Associate ,"Vienna, WV 26105",11/15/17,2017,11,15

Decent,"I have been working at Walmart for almost over a month now. I work as a customer service associate/cashier in the cosmetics department. I loved just being a customer service associate, which consisted of zoning, stocking, and assisting customers. I was originally hired as the cashier for the cosmetics department but the register wasn't open until about a week ago and needless to say I don't care for it. I always have customers complaining about taking cosmetics out from the department in security boxes or having to pay at the register. Don't get me wrong there are people who ask if they need to pay or if it has to go in the box but I just don't care for having to say pay or I need to lock it up. I don't enjoy making customers feel as if they are thieves. My management is AMAZING, I could never complain about that since they are such kind and helpful people. They work around my schedule and that really helps considering I have a 3 month old son and attend school online. I did enjoy being a cashier in the front end since it did make the days go by faster.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Corpus Christi, TX",11/15/17,2017,11,15

The management where I work is not all good they either listen to your problem but not do anything or do something about your problem but a month later. The workplace is  splendid because I get along with everyone I meet. The hardest part of my job is working so many things, handed so many tasks but having little to no time to work on any of it because other associates or customers have question that I am the only person I can answer.

purgatory is an appropriate description,"Do not work here. Positions are only categorized as ""part time"" no matter how long you work.It also doesn't matter what department you work in. I worked at the same store for about 11 years...I did an AVERAGE of 37-39 hours every single week and was intentionally categorized as ""part time"" to limit my benefits. The only people who are ""full time"" are department heads and MANAGERS. Everyone I worked with was consistently poor, stressed out, and sick. Almost every person I worked with was on food stamps or some sort of public assistance including low level managers! Expect little to no mercy if you are injured or sick. If you don't come to work they will FIRE YOU. I have covered shifts for people so they could go to funerals, tend to sick children, or take care of themselves. I have worked with people who have had major broken bones (hands, arms), people who were recently hit by cars (think like going back to work in the same week for fear of being out) those with major illnesses. (An older woman I worked with had a heart attack or a stroke and was back at work in about a week) If you work here you will miss your family. To get ""hours"" you need to have an almost unending availability. For about 9 years I was available every night, every weekend and every holiday. The only time of year I got to spend with my family was Christmas Day (they are closed one day a year). _x000D__x000D_I liked most of my coworkers and I really enjoyed my regular customers, they made even my worst days better.I will miss my regular customers.

Not easy to get time off for becoming a foster parent.,"Walmart puts up a lot of barriers when associates ask for time off to adjust to a major issue such as becoming a foster parent to a grandchild. They try to discourage associates from accessing benefits such as a leave of absence, which is greatly needed when taking on a 2 year old foster child. They will fire you if you reach 9 absences in a rolling six month period, even if those absences were due to taking a foster child to his medical appointments, or babysitting them when they are sick, or when their daycare is closed for a holiday.

Unfortunately, in my experience this mentality seemed to have been all, but abandoned with him gone.  Walmart boast high starting pay rates and advancement opportunities, and then trains its employees with videos that assert your importance to the company, but in my experience as an employee, the general mentality of the workers was that we were viewed as easily replacable if our contribution wasn't worthy in the warehouse.  In my observation, this fear didn't seem to go away, even when you had moved up.  It didn't bother me much at first as I felt I was putting an honest effort into the job, but as I moved toward advancement in the company, I shared some ideas to help us improve operations, one of which she told me that she had suggested the same thing and was told by the engineers that, ""She did not make enough to worry about these things.""  I pushed for some of these ideas that I felt would improve operations, but I would always agree to stand united with them when she explained that Walmart wants us to do it another way, in spite of the desire to point out that the training videos say that Sam Walton loved to hear his employees' ideas and often made very successful changes based on them.

Summary of Working at Walmart,"Hardest part about working at Walmart is always understaffed, having to do other associates work due to them not wanting/willing to work. What was enjoyable about working at  Walmart? probably learning new things, helping customers who were actually NICE and appreciated your service and meeting new people. Culture is very diverse but depending on where you live it can be a hassle. Typical day is cleaning up after people constantly, keeping things neat and clean for customers, cleaning up messes, assisting customers to what they were looking for. Management was mediocre, depending on the manager they either liked you, or didn't like you and made you do more than others. It was never meant to be sided and picking favorites, but it happens more times than none. I worked at walmart for 5 years and i honestly hated going into work sometimes, other times, didn't mind so much. It all depends on the store, department and management.

I've also learned how to manage relatively large projects under strict deadlines. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to interact with people of various backgrounds, ethnicity, and beliefs. Diversity is what makes a company stronger. The hardest part of my job is knowing when to stop working and take a break because I take pride in the quality of work that I submit. The management team is very lax as we primarily work independently, but in some cases we must work on projects together. I love what I do. I get to come to work everyday and solve problems.

The manager had set high standards for his store and employees, he was always making sure his store was at least #1 in the area for sales and customer satisfaction.

Also I would help customers (with a smile) for whatever questions they may ask. After being on the sales floor for a little while and getting the hang of everything, a typical day would be selling ammo, fishing/hunting licenses, guns, helping customers, mixing paint, and cutting fabric. There is more to the job that hasn't been included but it wouldn't be on a typical day, so most of the stuff I've been able to do as a sales associate had taught me a lot.

Busy Place,"Clock in and get carts ready to unload the truck.  Some days the truck would have 2500 boxes and other days much more.  If not unloading the truck, you are on the other side doing large box pallets and getting items stocked before carts from the truck have to go out to the aisles.  They have increased the pay quite a bit and the managers are good at this store for the most part.  There is a strict no overtime policy and scheduling was terrible.  Days off during the week were scattered and not back to back days like 99% of most businesses so this is very inconvenient.  The managers always took the weekends off so be prepared to work weekends.  You get two paid short breaks but are required to clock out for an hour lunch which was nice.   The hardest part was not knowing where things are when customers are always asking for where things are.  The store has high turnover so most days we were short handed.",3,Former Employee,Store Associate ,"Durango, CO",11/7/17,2017,11,7
Enjoy working at night,I've learned alot during retail. The hardest part is being on feet all night. Managment is very unorgganized.

Can be fun but you're thrown into a grinder.,"Where to begin? Well my coworkers were a fun lot. Typically everyone I worked with was easy to get along with. But work was typically an exchange of heaping responsibilities onto each other. _x000D__x000D_Someone is out sick? Well you now need to do their job as well as your own; and most of the time you were stretched thin. I actually had someone accuse me of not doing my work while I was covering someone else's area because surprise the customers don't just stick to one area of the store. I even saw that a year later when they were doing my yearly review for determining what kind of raise I got. They don't even adjust pay rates if you had to cover someone with a higher pay grade than you. _x000D__x000D_And if you had to leave because they don't want you going over 40 hours, you pretty much had to dump your work onto someone. Wasn't a good motivator for a lot of people.  _x000D__x000D_Backroom was no different. When one manager left for the day the manager replacing them had to take over and I had to get two to three conversations a day on whatever they felt was important at the time. Felt like I was in the movie Office Space but for retail. For the longest time I was pulling pallets out to the sales floor only to pull them back into the backroom. I was literally going in circles. _x000D__x000D_But other than that, if it didn't need to be done right away, the atmosphere was fairly relaxed.",2,Former Employee,Backroom Associate ,"Avon, MA",11/7/17,2017,11,7

A fast paced place to work in hot or cold environment.,"No two days were alike, it was fast paced but the coworkers and coaches helped when needed. If someone needed help all they had to do was ask, example if someone didn't have their forklift license and needed someone to up stack pallets or get a pallet down from racking whomever had a license would help them.

The System does not work for the Associates,"Wal-Mart operates on a system. That particular system doesn't necessarily need competent workers within it.

Never a relaxed day,"we were always worked hard, there was no slowing down. I learned that you have to be consistent with your work, and many other things since walmart was my first job. The management was horrid. Me and my coworkers always felt stressed and were constantly pushed to our limits, and if anything ever went wrong, even if it was due to something out of our control, we still got chewed out for it. The hardest part for me was having to deal with the negative energy that a lot of people came to work with, and having to work overtime so many times and have members of the team leave before the job is done. I have no problem staying later as long as everyone lends a hand to help get done the job that is all of the teams responsibility. Trust me, it is hard making a 30 minute drive to work when you've only had 4 hours of sleep. The thing that got me through it all was the handful of people that i worked with and also got along with.

If they found a problem, you would get coached and written up for poor performance.  I was never in that position, yet not 1 time did local management acknowledge that my aisle was stocked properly._x000D_I felt under appreciated.

Not The Best,If you are a casher it can be quick or slow depending on what time of day it is. Start off pay sucks and so does the raise. You do get a bonus every 3-6 months.

"Overworked,  under compensated","Inconsistent schedule,  always expected to go above and beyond with no compensation, not even a thank you.  Schedule changes without notification  or consulting you. No hands-on training. A classroom and computer setting, then you're shown to your department and expected to know everything.  Walmart's core values are based on 1950s Sam Walton, and are taught, but never enforced or used.  Walmart believes in less people, more work.  You will need to spend your days off sleeping and destressing. NO work life balance. Only 20 cent annual raises for hourly associates. Doesn't matter if you're a slacker or hard worker, because no matter what,  your getting a 2% raise. Which is roughly 20 cents for most people.  You can advance in the company if you are willing to give up your family and have an extreme lack of empathy.

"What once was, now is not.","I would say that working for Wal-Mart is like Forrest Gump's classic line. ""Life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get."" That explains Wal-Mart to the fullest. In most jobs, you typically get out what you put into it. Hard to agree with that logic in the case of the big retailer.

The same thing every day it seemed and nothing was being done to remedy the situation. Over the coarse of 2 years I'd have to say it was an easy and decent job when you got to actually do your correct job.

Store to store difference,"Walmart is a great place to work because it has a deep culture. There are a lot of great people who have worked there for their entire lives. However, the issue is those who don't like change, will make life harder for those who accept the changes. This mainly pertains to the salaried level of management or higher. I was fortunate because I had a fantastic store manager and a great team of assistant managers who really made me feel welcome and helped guide me throughout my time there. However, I have heard that my case, which I share often because it's been great, is a rarity. After transferring from one store to another, I started to see what they meant. A lot of the times I meet with managers who just pencil whip tasks so they can move on to the next one. I currently have a boss who thinks they know how to lead a team, but the only time things run smoothly is when they're not there.

Working in Grocery Store,"Working at Wal-Mart had its ups and downs. I was working at a Wal-Mart supermarket that unfortunately had very bad management. They spoke to you in a tone where they knew they had more authority over you and there was nothing that you could do about it. A typical day at the job consisted of cleaning, and stocking the products wherever they belonged. Once you were done stocking, you had to zone(basically arranging the products so that they are neatly organized). Working here taught me a lot more about the needs and wants of customers. You have to be very patient with customers and make sure that their needs are the most important, keeping the customers happy keeps them coming back. There was not really a hard part about the job because it was really relaxed, just do what you were told and everything was going to be okay.",3,Former Employee,STOCKER/REMODEL TEAM MATE ,"Charlotte, NC",11/5/17,2017,11,5

Would not recommend as a place to work,"My experience with Wal-Mart was not a pleasant one. My typical day of work consisted of many different managers ordering me to do many things at once, then chewing me out when I was doing a task I was assigned to do by a different manager. What i learned during my time here was that the company typically uses one employee to cover multiple people's worth of work. They typically didn't mind if a job was done hastily as long as it was done. Management seemed to suffer from a lack of communication and were unable to come to a consensus on what tasks needed to be prioritized. The Workplace culture was very fast paced. The hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with the demand of customers plus the constant nagging of management.

They tell you that you can transfer to a different job after a year, but you have to be hitting production to transfer, and hitting production is next to impossible.

had bagels on fridays,not a fun place to work for most people.  the morale is extremely low for most associates which in turn makes mostly everyone miserable working there.   i feel that if they did something to build the morale of the assoicates they would have a much happier work place.  the bad feelings and complaints seem to bring down the whole store where as if people were happier and didnt complain and hate and complain so much about each other people would be happier.,2,Former Employee,Merchandise Supervisor ,"Hudson, FL",10/31/17,2017,10,31

"Great career development, lack of leadership","Wal-Mart has been a love-hate work relationship with me. You get to develop your skills at the largest retailer in the world. There are plenty of resources to develop yourself. Fixing a systemic issue can result in millions of dollars for the company so you really see the impact of what you are doing. The culture can be described as follows: Work from 7am to 530pm. Plenty of meetings, most resulting in no results. There is a wide gap in pay from the lower level associates to the higher level. Directors and above make a good amount of money, have good stock incentives, and a nice bonus. Lower level employees can make more money at other companies. Many people leave the company to get a raise, then come back in a couple years at a much higher level, doing the same job they did before they left. There is also a wide gap between the directors and lower level employees with technical skills.

The 3 months of training were ok, but after about 4 months I along with others began to figure out that the culture there was very misleading. They have all of these quotes from the founder Sam Walton all over the place, but management failed to truly live by them which in turn made for a terrible work environment. It's corporate all the way. I've heard that working there used to be great, but those 7 months were anything but.

You can't blame the company for the general public's behavior but the pay is the worst._x000D_Don't expect to live above the poverty line if this is your main source of income. The best part is the health insurance. There are several options to choose from and they offer vision and dental. Wal-mart does know how to put a benefits package together but, I can't afford to take advantage of the 401K or anything else because of the lack of pay.

Management is decent, but has begun to go downhill. I've learned more things about the products in my work area and have more of an extensive knowledge of things that I always wanted to learn more about.

I was hired to work in the lawn and garden department, but I have been a cashier, a toy, housewares, electronics, hardware, and sporting goods associate.

Fast paced at times.,A typical day at Walmart is having a staff meeting at the beginning of your shift and completing your tasks. What I have learned from working at Walmart is everybody expects you to know what you are doing on your very first day. Management to me was hard to find when needing to ask for help and management also asks you questions that they already know the answer to but still proceed to ask you and interrupt your work. The workplace culture at Walmart is relatively nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job is trying to remember where items go and sometimes working with unrealistic time frames to complete tasks.

"Walmart was ok in the beginning, but corporate made many changes that I feel did not make the store any better and ended hurting the employees.","If I was working the opening shift, I would first collect the till for the register. My next responsibility would be to make sure my department(electronics) was clean and organized. I would then start to stock the shelves with the merchandise that was received the previous night. Throughout all of this my number one priority is customer service. Mondays and Tuesdays I was responsible for setting the new DVD and video game displays. I also worked the backroom assigning overstock to its assigned locations.I learned how to track merchandise and its availability in our store and other Walmart stores in the area.Most important, I learned facts about our merchandise so that I could assist the customer intelligently. My department manager is excellent, but I felt upper management did not have a good grasp on everything that it took to run our department properly.

One day my blood sugars were so bad I called my doctors office and the nurse told me if I didn’t go to the hospital it wouldn’t end well for me. Well needless to say I notified my manager and they told me if I left I would be fired because I didn’t have any more points for attendance. Trying to get time off with an injury is a nightmare too. I broke my foot and obviously had to be on crutches and the management team refused to let me come in to work and do something else until I was off the crutches so I had to take a few days and was almost fired because they didn’t have me fill out paperwork correctly to the company that approves days off for injury. I then had to get a walking boot to come back to work and was constantly yelled at for how slow I was moving and the fact I couldn’t get everything done.

After 4 weeks, I had to quit. Walmart is not the best place to work. I have worked for a retail store and got the best training from co-workers. I didn't realize what I got into. I should have done more research before I applied. Mangers will not help you or co workers. You are put out on the register and have to figure it out on your own. To many codes to remember.

"Good co-workers, stressful job.","As a maintenance associate my day-to-day duties include keeping the restrooms clean and stocked, keeping the floors clean, emptying the trash, and cleaning up any spills that happen in the store. I work as a part of a team with one or two others, and we split up duties with one person cleaning the restrooms, one person mopping, etc. How stressful the job is usually depends on the time of week and year. Weekends are busier than weekdays as most people like to do their grocery shopping then, so we get more spills. This gets worse during Holiday season, as the busier the store is, the harder it is to keep clean. On the busiest days, we kept getting called across the store to clean up dirt and such before we have a chance to respond a call made five minutes prior.

Just be prepared.,"Probably the easiest job in the world. The hardest part is dealing with incompetent co-workers and management. Some members of management are super helpful while others sit in the office playing candy crush and only pay attention to the employees that suck up to them. But the pay is better than most places and if you get made full-time you are able to receive benefits. If you do become full-time though be prepared for management to act like they did you the biggest favor ever. When in all honesty you'll probably be working the same amount of hours you always did because the turnover rate is ridiculous. And be super wary of being ""cross-trained"" to do anything above your pay grade. If they really want you in the position they'll pay you for it.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service/Cash Office Associate ,"Florence, AL",10/25/17,2017,10,25

Poor Management and favoritism,"Working for walmart had a purpose that it served, if you are in need of a job right away they are likely the place to go to get your feet under you. However, they are but a stepping stone and staying too long can result in finding it harder and harder to justify the issues that are seen every day with favoritism in the workplace, poor management skills of the management team from department managers to upper management, very poor communication skills between departments, shifts, and roles to the point of the managers that are in charge of an area of work dont have any idea how things are run in that area. The people you end up working with are just as you would expect, they are regular people and most of who you meet can easily become close friends and your loyalty to your work is less about the company and more about not wanting the people you care about having to carry your load. Changes to the way things are run are always made on the fly with very little heads up, most of the time the new information is given either the day of or the day after the changes are made. As with most any other retail jobs your schedule is never a set thing and can be changed very quickly and done both without your knowledge or consent until it is already past the time they decided you should work and you are already late or you are let know two to three days later after the damage is done and you have no idea the changes were made.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Marysville, WA",10/25/17,2017,10,25

A rewarding and sometimes stressful place to work.,"I Love working with all the associates in my job as Training Coordinator.  However, there doesn't seem to be any structure a lot of the time. We are so busy doing other jobs that we find it hard to get our regular work finished each day. We end up staying overtime to complete tasks and then we can't keep the overtime. We have to cut it by the end of the pay week.  Overall it can be stressful at times but it has many rewards, like being able to help associates with questions they may have about benefits, payroll, discounts, etc. And training new associates is also a great plus. On a positive note, my position as Training Coordinator is fulfilling as,long as I can focus on that job. On a,typical day, our office is very busy. People are,always coming in and out. When we have orientation for the new associates, we post a sign on our door letting the other associates know not to come in unless it is absolutely necessary. They rarely pay attention to the sign and just barge right in. I have had to be strict with them sometimes and,ask them to come back when the new associates go to lunch or break. I have learned quite a bit since working there. Some examples: How to find answers for associates about payroll, job openings internally, how to read their pays tub and also how to apply for benefits and explain what each one means.",2,Current Employee,Training Coordinator ,"Beckley, WV",10/25/17,2017,10,25

walmart,I like working there but the don't pay as well as other jobs and the management don't really care about there people. As much money this company makes a year I believe they should pay there associates more than they do. and the insurance has a high deductible and someone cant reach if they go to the doctor that much so most people are sruck paying the whole amount,4,Former Employee,Deli Clerk ,"Colorado Springs, CO",10/25/17,2017,10,25
heartless employer,"I gave my all for four years at Walmart, 3 of those years as an manager, then just to be demoted and have a paycut for something very petty and small is terrible and heartless. the management has no communication and they don't train well and a lot of favortism",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"St. Albans, VT",10/25/17,2017,10,25

Fast and Friendly,"I was employed at Wal-Mart for 2 years. I enjoyed the work and work environment. Although my store was known for being rude, unorganized, and etc, I made sure I did my part everyday. I learned how to stock, bin, prep pallets, and scan items to their right locations. A challenge I faced at the time of my employment was the customers. Trying to help them and finish my assignment was really frustrating back then.

Place is not a place you want to rely on,Extremely poor management with very disgusting habits. Found moldy hot dog and old dirt food trays in the coat closet. Ants crawling around and fruit flies everywhere. Most management act like they cant assist others or do their actual job.

Staying Busy,"A lot of movement all day, whether dealing with associates or customers. There is always something new that's implemented, so there is a lot to learn which is always good. Management is a mixture, because people manage differently. Workplace culture is great, just have to keep enforcing it. Working the long hours would be the hardest part for me. Not much family time at home. Seeing the smiles on the associates and customers faces is what I enjoy mostly.",4,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Kenner, LA",10/25/17,2017,10,25

low impact job,A typical day is walking a lot. I learned how to be patient with the customers. Management could use some help.

I loved working with the public,3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Redmond, OR",10/25/17,2017,10,25
Overall a great place to work with some bumps in the road!,"Overall, Walmart is a great place to work! I work in the pharmacy, where we tend to stay on the busy side (not saying the rest of the store isn't busy.) We tend to get overtime, which is nice, but also hectic at the same time. Except long lines if you are working the registers in the pharmacy, and don't except the customers to be friendly. Of course, some of them will be friendly; however, most of them are rude, and not understanding of the wait times and the ordering systems. Be a team player, learn to work with different people. We all have different ideas. Communication is vital in this field. Your pharmacy team is your family- that is your support. The rest of the store, is your Walmart family, but you won't get half as close to them as you do, as your pharmacy family. Be ready to be independent! _x000D__x000D_Overall, the pay is nice.

Opinion,A typical day at work consists of coming into work with a good attitude about what needs to be accomplished. Each day I learn how to prefect the duties at hand if not already perfected. I also learn better ways to complete different assignments. The management at a work place needs to be consistence and precise.  A manager must have a plan at hand to delegate assignments.  The workplace culture may be tedious of calm at times. One must be able to adjust to different situations in a workplace. The hardest part of a job is not having structure. The most enjoyable part of a job is knowing that you accomplished what was at hand.,3,Former Employee,"Sales Associate, Cake decorator, cashier ",South Carolina,10/25/17,2017,10,25

Not as bad as you hear about,WM is a great company to work for if you like retail. There are many policies in place to keep things fair and working nicely. As far as retail goes I would say it is one of the best paying places. I only left because I was capped money wise and I needed more time with my family.

Relaxed workplace with simple tasks that kept you moderately busy,"The work environment provided was comfortable and friendly. Even if you have a specific position or role you are often moved around to try and complete other tasks. Multiple managers, but this caused inconsistency in directions and some frustration. Managers where very lenient in general because the work was rather simple and always got done anyway. The most enjoyable part of the job was the independent work (if you chose) or the option to work with other associates. The hardest part of the job was definitely finishing one task, it always seemed like someone was trying to pull you so that you could complete another task.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Fresh Dept. Cleaner ,"La Puente, CA",10/25/17,2017,10,25

"Overall, not a bad place to work...",It wasn't a bad job. It definitely paid better than most retailers.

Awesome job with a pool table and a basketball hoop.,My typical day at work was just the right speed of work I wanted. Everyone that worked overnights with me was so nice to me we were like a family.

"Great first job, don't stay too long unless you plan to fight your way up.","Although providing great work experience and benefits to their employees, the upper management team has a corrupt inner politics battle among themselves with the exception of a few. With a high turn over rate of employees they hire and then provoke older employees into becoming eligible to be fired it is a game of keeping the cost of the employees down to save the store money so the upper management team are able to maintain their large end of the year bonuses. However the lower management team is far more relate-able and realistic in their approach to customer service.

Tough but relaxing job,The shifts were 10pm-7am each night. Normally spent most of the time stocking shelves and breaking down boxes.Often had to lift boxes that were 50-75lbs.

Not so good anymore,This company at one time or another was great to work for they offered good hourly pay good benefits full time vacation. but then they became nation wide they become corporate and they got stuck up. so no more pay raise after 90 days no more good hourly pay you get a minimum wage no full time unless your management . no more benefits or vacation. the stores are always short handed because like all corporate companies they prefer to work on a minimum staffing to cut cost for big corporate boss bonuses. Just don't do it,4,Former Employee,Overnight frozen food associate ,"Rockwall, TX",10/23/17,2017,10,23
A good job to get on our feet,"Working as a csm is stressful at walmart if you dont have a good manger who knows how to schedule for the front end and if they dont give you enough cashiers to work with... The customers always upset with you even when its out of your control and poor management is the real reason behind the lack of customer service. They make it hard for you to do your job properly or provide good customer service.

Keeps taking away things beneficial to associates each year,Walmart used to be a great place to work for but the company keeps cutting out things each year. They cut hours during the HOLIDAYS!

Great people!,There is a great deal of change at Walmart right now as they try to adjust and be competitive with online retailers. The amount of change and the pace with which it is occurring has created a sense of confusion for the managers and associates in the stores. The changes are needed (if not long overdue) to stay relevant in today's retail environment. The associates in the stores are great people and a joy to work with.,4,Former Employee,Asset Protection Regional Director ,"Murrieta, CA",10/23/17,2017,10,23

Job Summary,"A typical day at work as a MM at Walmart is fast paced, requiring flexible, quick, decision making, and a willingness to modify plans to meet goals and to accommodate Associate needs.  Management must be able to follow a complex decision tree rooted in company process and procedure while meeting the ever changing and complex needs of the customer.  The workplace culture can be tough due to the pace and Managers at Walmart must be able to deal with a task list that is always growing and never 100% complete.  The hardest part of the job is the need to be ever vigilant working to predict and prevent opportunities before they arise.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job is people development and Walmart allows it's managers to invest heavily in this area.",5,Former Employee,Market Manager ,"Lafayette, IN",10/23/17,2017,10,23

For the right person its a reasonable place to work and pay is fair.,"I am not anti Walmart, however, when one works there it will be obvious that you are working for a large corporation and very little control is exercised at the store level.

Fun and Complicated,"Fast pace,enjoyable on a typical day, I've learned patience, fairness, trust , happiness, empathy, honesty goes a long way. Management have its moments like everyone. Culture is diverse. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an irate customer or associate, Patience and listening and knowing how to handle the situation plays a great role in Customer Service and Satisfaction .",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Manchester, MO",10/22/17,2017,10,22
Stressful depending what department your placed in,one down fall is working in one department and getting pulled to cover one or two others. also only working four hour shifts sometimes two to three weeks at a time.,4,Former Employee,Electronics/Connections Associate ,"Sunnyside, WA",10/22/17,2017,10,22
Literally the worst place to work,I don’t even know where to start . I was only there for 3 months & so much happened within those 3 months. The managers are garbage . All of them. Customers are also garbage. All of them as well. Get paid 9.00 to do everything under the sun. I used to work in the men’s department. They would want sales associates to get on registers as cashiers . Like just hire more people,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Dearborn, MI",10/21/17,2017,10,21

Fun Place to work for,A typical day for me would be to unload at least two trucks full of merchandise and then After that I would have to palletize the merchandise and then bring the merchandise out to the salesfloor,5,Former Employee,ICS Associate ,"Corona, CA 92881",10/21/17,2017,10,21
Stressful & Unappreciate,"When first working, it has been stressful to maintain production to achieve a percentile and maintaining safety at the same time. Majority of the individual never yell 20 feet to indicate they are getting their pallet to be placed in its destination and seems everyone tries to keep you from getting the tasks down on time. Safety is never a priority and totally wouldn't recommend even a high school graduate who is in search of a job to work there, due to the high stressful day-to-day tasks and treatment they shown.",1,Current Employee,Lift Driver ,"Gordonsville, VA",10/21/17,2017,10,21
Regular retail,"I start off my job by making a list of how many associates I have for the day and then check to see the call off list . I then task out each of my associates the tasks for the day on the computer. I then take a walk around the store and look at the status of the sales floor and see if there any problems that need to be addressed.

We had good group of sales associates which made day enjoyable,"Walmart was fun and challenging  at first, upper management was good and fair, newer managers were young and inexperienced.

Poor managment,The management did not care about their employees.  The CEOs did not care about employees either.  You go 10% off your purchases.  You could not get overtime at all.  If you did not get off on time you had to cut it later in the week.,3,Former Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER ,"Seguin, TX",10/21/17,2017,10,21
Great starting job,Working at Walmart for me was great. There's a lot of opportunities for career advancements. The pay does start off low but if you advance it does get better. Management was great extremely professional helpful and understanding. However you do need an open schedule to get more hours because they have an automated system. I'd recommend Walmart as a first job it gives you great experience and you can move up fairly quickly.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"White Lake, MI",10/21/17,2017,10,21

We were given times by headquarters, but management would adjust those times and lie about it or tell us they aren't correct to begin with. Sometimes blamed for lack of proper equipment.

Customers and Co-workers make it a fun place to work,"Very busy and structured. I learned to run a register and all the responsibilities that it requires, i did really enjoy being at the register. I learned how to identify clothing styles, name brands. I learned how to structure the clothing departments to better bring eye appealing and curiosity to customers. Management for the Apparel department was very sparse and unstructured. Workplace culture was survial of the fittest, you have to be very independant and self structured to work there. Hardest part of the job was no structure stablility between the manager/managers and the employees for that department. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to do a job well done, get it done, as well as helping customers have a good shopping experience.",5,Former Employee,"Cashier, Sales Associate ","Glendale, AZ",10/21/17,2017,10,21
good work place but horrible management,"Walmart is a great place to work, its easy to understand. The managers on the other hand are absolutely horrible.

Interactive and Helpful Workplace,"Walmart was a great place to work. All my managers and co-workers embraced me with open arms. If I ever needed hep with something they were always happy to do so. Everyone did their part and during the time I worked there I never experienced any conflicts or problems. A typical day at work I would stock electronics, and check customers out at the register if they only came to buy electronics. The hardest part of the job was when the holidays came around and so many customers need help finding their desired items. The most enjoyable part was how relaxed the work environment could be at times because everyone knew what had to be done and if any problems arose we quickly resolved them.",5,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Allen, TX",10/21/17,2017,10,21

Terrible attendance system & management,"There are a few good managers in the store, but for the most part they don't care about anything that doesn't have to do directly with them.

It was far from a fun workplace and no extra activities to relieve stress,"Day would start to see what door I covered as a greeter, clock in, go to door. Make sure I have return tickets made out for customers returning items. Check floor for cleanliness a riding carts plugged in. Greet customers by saying good morning welcome to Walmart and sometimes I would direct them to were an item they wanted was. When exiting at times when very busy I would not have time to greet, as I had to try and stop everyone or look at every cart going by to make sure they didn't try to sneak behind, which when I was very busy some did. I has to stop the ones with items not in a bag and check their receipts and often got a lot of verbal abuse and once sometimes pushed or feet ran over purposely. _x000D_If someone tried to run out or steal something, usually electronics, I had to try and stop them and yell for management as I did not have a walkie as most did. My job was one of the hardest and many co-workers said they did not know how us greeters did it. I learned some people are co-operative and some aren't but always be professional. Management was never happy nor complimented when we caught someone stealing a television or made people happy. It appeared they could only criticize what they felt was wrong like you missed that receipt on the floor pick it up, and so forth. We had all races working. Management was the hardest part. The most enjoyable was getting the customers to smile, it was so rewarding and talking about their children, it was great.",3,Former Employee,Greeter ,"Warren, OH",10/21/17,2017,10,21

Good close to home job,"Wal-mart like most 'big box"" retail stores exist in  demanding stressful  environment. You must be willing to deal with heavy public contact. They lean too much on computer based training for my taste. Most management come up through the ranks, which is good to a point. However my time there would indicate that most of them would benefit from outside training or experience.",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Katy, TX",10/21/17,2017,10,21

"Low pay, no advancememt, minimal hours",I enjoyed working at Walmart but I noticed early on advancement was not an option. After working there for 3 years I still had not cleared $10 an hour. Management is lazy. It is extremely hard to get a full-time spot. Overtime is never an option except for around the holidays. After the holidays your hours will get cut dramatically. Walmart doesnt follow the law in terms of scheduling part-timers at least 20 hours per week. I had times where I would get as low as 12 hours but and fear of losing my job I never complained. The Discount was great but the stocks are useless as i never seen a penny earned.,2,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Millville, NJ",10/21/17,2017,10,21

But as time went on and new managers had come in the any attempt to vary the work became the same and no mangers had ever seemed to take any employee input.  Many employed had to  pester mangers over the course of weeks to see any action with regard to changing shift times, to requesting days off and even work accommodations.

"Horrible, horrible, horrible","Wal-Mart was, at one time, a decent place to work.  Not any more.  The entire culture of the place has gone completely downhill.  Managers are concerned only with their own advancement, and are more worried about losing their jobs than they are about assisting associates with theirs.  Corporate policy has foolishly determined that fewer and fewer associates can handle the same number of customers.  Sales have declined as a result of less and less customer service available.

Great pay. Bad management.,"The company as a whole wasn't so bad. The management at the location I was were messy. They were two faced, discussed associate disciplines and other personal info with other associate's. They cursed the associates and wouldn't let you leave.  They weren't training the associates or department managers at all. The management team just delegated their notes to the associates without properly going over them. They sat in the office and I would watch them walk in and out the door to smoke. I would say in an 8 hour shift, I've seen them do this 6-10 times daily. The associates were great but got little recognition for sales or anything for that matter. The company would be so much better if only they really saw how their management team operate. The employees were pretty much running the store. They always say they won't retaliate but that's not true.

an OK place to work,depending on the shift you work you may or may not have a decent manager. I was there for about two years and was promised over and over that i would get a management position but they never followed through. The hardest part about working there was not going off on rude customers. You have to be prepared to not get recognized for all the hard work you do. The most enjoyable part was seeing you're regular customers faces light up when they see that you are working.

While the GM is professional and a good leader, lower level managers tend to have big egos while offering little in the way of training.  They expect you to find out on your own how to complete the job and often work non busy hours and take weekends off.

A typical day at Wal-Mart is checking people out, bagging their grocery's and having a little bit of conversation to keep the awkwardness away. Something you learn from working at Wal-Mart is going a pace passed and trying to not mess up so the customers don't get angry and can get out as fast as they can. Everyone messes up but knowing how some people can get it something that I don't like dealing with but you got to do what you got to do at that point in time.

"productive, stressful and sometimes fun and busy",I worked overnights at Walmart supercenter. A typical work night was long and was never the same each night. I learned to better my customer service and what to do incase of an emergency. I learned how to stock fast and used the register. The management was good but not great. Never a straight answer from whoever would be working. Things were difficult to talk about with management because it felt like nobody was listening or wanted to help make the work place better. Workplace culture was busy sometimes and dead another. Never a dull moment working nights. The hardest part of the job was being able to get enough sleep to go in the next night or changing the store around for holidays was pretty hard and stressful. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was meeting new people. helping my customers and making them leave with a smile.,3,Former Employee,Mod team/Cashier ,"Casper, WY",10/16/17,2017,10,16

Stressful but flexible,It was a stressful environment but that's because we were always under staffed. Management was hard to work for because they expected you to go above and beyond for them bit would treat you poorly. Management liked to talk down to their employees and treat them harsh and always needed you to stay late or pick up extra shifts last minute but threw a fit if you needed a day or two off or if you needed an hour away for a Dr's appointment.

For the most part, everyone was well overworked for the compensation. I learned a variety of skills while working at Walmart, I do feel as though I became a valued employee to this company in doing so.",4,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Loveland, CO",10/15/17,2017,10,15

Need better compensation,Walmart isnt a bad place to start out working. They pay a little more than minimum wage and you do learn a lot working for them. But eventually you have to move on as you find that your pay rate wont change much even after working there for a few years.

Productive workplace but rather stressful.,"Overall Walmart was a decent place to work: friendly co-workers, fair pay, and plenty opportunities to learn and advance. The management was less than desirable however. Although it was anecdotal, it made our job much more stressful: having blame shifted on the employees when any issue surfaced, refusing to acknowledge scheduling discrepancies, and holding everyone over passed their clock out time for hours at a time. Other than the mentioned issues, the job was very enjoyable and the friendly environment all of my co-workers promoted made it worthwhile. _x000D_ Stocking was extremely easy yet enjoyable. It would get overwhelming some nights when we would have large trucks. It was especially relaxing when you had a co-worker assisting you, providing banter throughout the night to make it pass quickly.",4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Somerset, KY",10/15/17,2017,10,15

I was verbally abused by customers on a daily basis.  The only person who seemed to enjoy her job was the store manager who I assume was hired for her lack of compassion.

The hardest part of the job is being consistent at every task that you may have and trying to pace yourself to get your lines down and keep them at a 5 guest minimum at one time, you don't want to have long lines.The most enjoyable part of the job is having a satisfied customer and doing everything to your best ability to keep the customer happy and coming back to your store.",5,Former Employee,Retail Associate/Customer Service ,"Bedford, TX",10/14/17,2017,10,14

Stressful and Long hours,"A typical day at Walmart you'll never know if you're going to lose your job when coming in to work. They micro manager and if you're a salaried manager expect to work very long hours. There's no time for your family or personal time. They give you a lot of PTO hours, but make it difficult to take time off. All they care about is they're bottom line even though they are a multi-billion dollar company. The customers are difficult and complain about every single thing. Customers can be a joy and some can be challenging, but they most difficult is the lack of support from upper management.

"Poor management, cutthroat environment","My specific Walmart is run by fear and everyone is scared to lose their job causing an unneeded stress filled environment.  The current owner puts all the stress on the assistant managers which they then push the crew harder causing the drop out rate to sky rocket.  If I ask for parts to a machine or supplies that are integral to doing my job. I may not even get it for up to a month because it is not ""in the budget"" and by then the boss would have already wanted the job done. _x000D_         I cannot stand to see such blatant corporate greed and laziness when the store would run much smoother if people cared more for each other instead of just a paycheck.",2,Current Employee,Maintanance supervisor ,"Mansfield, OH",10/14/17,2017,10,14

The worst place to work.,Upper management does not care about their employees or their customers. Work schedules always suck. We are always understaffed even on the busiest of days.They is no consistency in what they do at this Walmart. I miss my old store manager from 6 years ago. When work equipment breaks down it is like pulling teeth trying to get them to have the equipment fixed. They will not provide me with a walkie talkie to better help the customers when they need assistance throughout the store. Many days I had to do all the team work all by myself for several hours because managers don't have a clue how to make better work schedules.,1,Current Employee,Cart Associate ,"Hoover, AL",10/13/17,2017,10,13

Good luck.,You are never guaranteed your hours. One week maybe 27 or 28 and the next 33 or 34.  In my facility there are problems that keep happening and no one ever fixes them. A lot of complaining from management but no action on there part. I love the people i work but Moral here is almost non existent. I wish you could just come in and do your job and go home but that is not the case. The pay is competitive for the work but there aren't many options for advancement.

All the stories are true,"The Walmart store I worked at was in a rather poor part of town, and due to working out in the parking lot hazards to safety were everywhere.

Worst place I ever worked,Worked at a brand new store thought it was going to be a great opportunity to not be like the other stores with empty shelves and disappearing employees. 2 months into the job the Dept Managers were being reprimanded for empty shelves despite our asking for more information on the ordering system. It took 4 months before they actually trained us on the inventory management system for walmart. The culture is very biased. Everyone from Assistant Manager up are unapproachable and they let it be known. I ran 5 departments with only 5 part time employees and myself. Most of the time my employees were pulled to work other parts of the store leaving 5 departments with no one on duty.,1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Houston, TX",10/12/17,2017,10,12

Too stressful. Too much work and not enough help,Before I relocated to the new site it was constant micromanaging from the market level. Constantly fixing problems temporarily instead of looking for a permanent solution. Never got any acknowledgement or positive feedback on the work completed. Always focusing on the negative and always putting the employees down. Promotion was based on who you knew. And if you were great a certain position you were stuck there because they couldn't afford to replace you. But I did learn how to delegate and change work focus on the fly. Great HR skill.

Good place to begin joining the workforce.,"A typical day at work had the feeling of ""keep moving"" and ""get it done quickly and well"".  I learned that hard work is not often equitable to what is paid out to the hard worker.  Management seemed to care about their employees, but the rub came in with what policy dictated at times versus what an employee's need may have been.  This would often give the impression that management did not or could not care for their people properly.  I could empathize with both management and those they were to manage.  Workplace culture felt rough mixed with some levity.  Associates tended to make friendships with one another; part of this bond came out of stressful workplace conditions coupled to low to average income.  The hardest part of the job was working with the mission of ""the customer is always right"".  This simply is not true, though it is what company employees are to adhere to.  I have seen such a mission leave employees vulnerable and battered by inconsiderate customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working and building relationships with both customers and Associates.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Inventory Control Specialist ,"Waterloo, IA",10/12/17,2017,10,12

Decent Entry Level job - nothing more.,"I worked at Walmart as a part timer to get me through school. It's a decent entry level job - You'll get decent hours and as long as you do your job you won't get in trouble. The problems that lie with this company is the incredibly high turnover rate; when people leave left and right, associates struggle to get their department in order. Help is scarce and shifts usually only have skeleton crews (1 or 2 associates in a department at a time) From my point of view there are some managers that are good, some that are not; it'll vary. This is a solid part time job, something good for kids who are trying to get into the work force.",2,Former Employee,Associate ,Georgia,10/11/17,2017,10,11

Wal-Mart,"Wal-Mart was enjoyable at first, but once you pass your 90-day course they load everything on you. A lot of the managers were so stressed out I feel like they needed to step down and let someone who could handle it step up. They have an open door policy for every associate if you're having an issue but they don't really use it. A typical work day would include doing inventory, and stocking the shelves.

don't work here,"Walmart is an extremely stressful and unrewarding place to work. They're always under-staffed, which means you'll be working ten times as hard to do the work of multiple people by yourself. At my location I didn't receive proper training in my department, which meant that when I did something wrong, it was blamed on me despite my never having been taught in the first place. Additionally, upper-level management is a joke. The managers lack basic communication skills, and it shows. I often received conflicting orders from different managers simply because none of them have a clue. The workplace culture is a lot like that of a high school, because there are cliques and rumors and drama at every turn. The hardest part of the job here is working up the motivation to go in in the morning. The most enjoyable part is leaving at the end of the day. That being said, I wouldn't recommend working at Walmart to anyone with sense or better prospects.

Making customers happy will make my day joyful. When I see that someone looks to be having a ruff day I try to make their day better by talking with them and letting them know I care.Sometimes that is all people need is to have someone listen to them and give them a smile.

overnight Assistant Manager,"my experience at Walmart changed dramatically throughout the 3 years I was there. the work life balance became terrible because I am not a night person, thus everything in my personal life was sacrificed to achieve the goals of the store.

Pretty decent place,Walmart is a good place to work but you will definitely work for your pay check. The people whom you work with at this destination are in their own little groups but all co workers treat each other with respect. The manager Robbie is one of my main complaints because he walks around and really doesn't do anything and treats co workers disrespectfully. Rochelle and Andy are absolutely 100% amazing managers and have the patience and respect to train employees and direct them in the right direction.

Upper management has ruined this job,Used to be a great place to work. Many new people in upper management have been hired and they have made a lot of  changes and none have been good.  The dispatching is horrendous but local management has no say in anything anymore so whatever the computer says is what your doing.  Slowly every good thing that you earn by seniority is being taken away. Your time means nothing. Cost and productivity is factored into everything but home office and the dispatch center can waste millions of dollars and it doesn’t matter. If you are a true professional driver I would not recommend you apply with Walmart they do not treat anyone in the private fleet well enough to make the sacrifices for the job worth it anymore.,2,Current Employee,Driver ,Pennsylvania,10/7/17,2017,10,7

Not a bad place to work.,Not a bad place to work. Many of the co-workers were kind and it was enjoyable to work most days. Only complaints i have ever has was the knowledge of product and processes by management. Due to rotating managers every 6 months we were faced with teaching managers the processes of daily work in the department. Unfortunately by the time they would get into the rhythm of the job it would be time to change out. that was really the only frustrating part of the job the rest was easy. Do your job and do it to the best of your abilities and you should do fine.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Martinsburg, WV 25404",10/7/17,2017,10,7

Poor Management,There is a lack of experienced management.  They give more tasks than what can be achieved in a days work.  Too many managers giving out tasks.  Never have time to do the job you are required to do because we are so understaffed and we are always behind on freight which causes the morale in the store to be down.

They have some good hours...you most likely will get the shift you choose. I worked the weekend shift Saturday-Monday, 6:30am-6:30pm only getting 72 hours every 2 weeks, so my pay averaged out to making $15.00 an hour getting 40 hours. It's an okay job.

They are demeaning and also not empathetic when it comes to things such as family emergencies and fatigue due to overworking.

Productive.,"A typical day at work would, You clock in and if you were like me you get put on a register for 2 hours then take your break, Once you came back from break you ask your CSM(Customer Service Manager) who needs to be released. After another 2 hours it was lunch time. Someone would relieve you and you would go on about your lunch.After you came back you'd relieve someone else and be on the register for another 2 hours until it was time for you to go home.Managers are pretty lenient, They still expect yo to get your job done but in a team work kind of way(Where it didn't feel like you were working).Walmart's workplace culture is pretty amazing, NO matter how hard of a day you were having someone was always there to cheer you up. The hardest part about the job was when you would challenge yourself to get a job done but failed at the end.Everyone usually feels as if they let themselves down.

Tedious Stressful working environment,"Working for the Retail Giant is nothing that I had expected.  I have experience different environments such as Schools, Administration, Clerical, Supervisory, Food and Beverage, Hospitality, Customer Service.  Working for Wal-Mart has been a wake up call for the nerves of the human body.  There is so much physical work involved in maintaining these stores.  I have found that most employees that stay for several years have a strategy all their own.  There is such a revolving door of employees for Wal-Mart that you can be hired with several people at the same time and within a two to three week period those same people are now gone.  The turn over ratio is overwhelming.  The major issue felt throughout the store is that Management does not really care for their employees.  This is based on the work load that is assigned.  It can be fun, if you maintain a sense of humor and positive outlook.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Clermont, Fl.",10/5/17,2017,10,5
Human Resources,Wal-Mart as a Whole changed from being a Family Oriented Job to a Publicly trade Company on the open stock  market. That cause some Policy changes and reductions to stay competative in the over-all global market in which they existed. Being Publicly traded had its good point's with more stock options and its bad point's as in today's job market most jobs are either Part-Time or you are listed as Part-Time and Work nearly Full Time Hour with less Benefits or at a Higher cost leaving some people to literally work for their benefits than  Salary.  Overall WAL-MART is still a company that provides some benefits to it's employee's if you can survive the low hours available from time to time the part time-to- full time ratio has reversed over the years.,5,Former Employee,Personnel Manager ,"Lewisburg, WV 24901",10/5/17,2017,10,5

I still love Wal-Mart!!!!,"For the work I did, I was well paid.  I had every opportunity to advance into management but refused.  Customers can be moody but thats the same everywhere in customer service.  Some departments are under a lot of stress but management is working hard to fix it.

I did not get along with the store manager, and this made it difficult to open a new format Walmart Express from the ground up, but it was an opportunity for growth.  I think the most enjoyable part of my job was putting together a grand opening Healthcare Event with the team I put together and providing services not typically seen in a small community.

My work story in Wal-Mart.,"Wal-Mart starts with the unpredictability of jobs you have to do regardless whether it is a slow day or a busy day of customers and/or products.  The management is well organized, but every once in a while it does get into a bit of a slippery slope.  The atmosphere is somewhat decent whether it is the organization of the store the people that work there.  The hardest part to me is to try to make every customer feel needed considering the fact not everyone that comes is always going to be pleased.  It is something that myself and the other employees have to adjust and to just roll with it.  The only thing I enjoyed about the job was that some of the employees are nice enough people to have a conversation with, and sometime there are nice enough customers to speak to knowing that met an employee that is there for them.",4,Former Employee,Associate ,"Clarksburg, WV",10/5/17,2017,10,5
Nice place to work but pay is pretty low,"Unless your goal is to work your way up in order to one day be a Store manager then this job is one only for college students and high school students. The pay is pretty low almost at the same level as other retail and fast food. The best thing is that you get an hour lunch. Managers don't seem to understand what autism is or how to work with an individual with aspergers as they don't ever deviate from their regular approach at correcting people, but the good managers will be your best friends. Definitely NOT a recommended job for those with disabilities or that aren't highly receptive of body language.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Knoxville, TN",10/5/17,2017,10,5

I also had to put away returns at the customer service desk, as well as putting them back on the shelves personally.

Overnight Maintenance,Over night maintenance was actually pretty relaxed despite their being 2 others. The job should be either a one person job or a 2 person. When i was alone for the first week i did everything required from my manager and had around 15-20 min to spare. When you add more people their become less work and you get really bored after awhile because you have to either slow down your pace or make everything harder than its suppose to be.

A Frustrating Place with Some Really Crabby Customers,"A typically day of work as a cashier at Walmart consists of greeting customers and ringing up their purchases at the front registers.

The most difficult parts of the job involve dealing with cranky, sometimes emotionally unstable customers who can be quite demanding. The most enjoyable part of the job involves interacting with coworkers who are in the same age bracket and have similar goals.

There is some leeway between clocking in on time but it is best to clock in slightly before your shift and not after the start of it.

Walmart as a whole is moving to where everyone will be needing to be available at all hours, if you have certain restrictions just let the management know ahead of time so that they can be upfront with you about what that means for you.

The people I worked with were very nice and they were the best part of the job. I am still friends with a lot of the people I worked with!

They were very flexible with my school schedule, and if you need a lot of hours, you will get them.

"Walmart, not a place you wanna work","One of the WORST companies i have ever worked for. Managers show favoritism to certain individuals and give you more work than a person can handle and then writes you up for not being able to keep up.

Supervising and taking  notes from my manager,I was the department manager in house wares.  I had two to three sales associates under me at a time my day started with having a meeting with the store manager from there I would enter the back room to do picks which were generated everyday on my hand held. I would then take the picks out the back room to the sales floor to my associates who would work the freight I picked from the back room. My jump was to supervise my associates in order to make sure things ran  smoothly. During the day my manager would give me little odd  jobs to do. this would involve me doing modes or giving my associates a job to keep them occupied during their shift.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Bloomington, IL",10/4/17,2017,10,4

It's A Job,"Like any retail job, it pays well enough and is pretty consistent. The only reason I left was because I had to reattend school and the monotonous days were making me question my sanity. It's a very straight-forward job which is great that also means you are literally doing the same exact thing every single day of the week. I could only take it for so long. They pay bi-weekly and i was clearing 650-700 bi-weekly which was lovely at the time. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with management who thinks they're some sort of Gods.

Customer service is not for the weak,Cashiering or being a sales/floor associate is a fairly easy job however working in customer service/money center is not for the weak. Not only do you have to work in stressful conditions but there's also carts/buggies full of returns that must be sorted and then the items that need to be returned have to be put on the shelves with no one coming to get their department's returns. Customers are yelling at you and throwing hissy fits when they don't get their way and management tries to tell you how to do your job when they don't even know how to do it themselves.

The management is really poor there.,"They beat the did horse on wanting to fix issues that the employees have, but issues that may vary from store-to-store are overlooked by corporate statistics that the company gets from social sciences that they employ.

it was a nice place to work and i enjoyed it,"a typical day of work was having routines with other colleagues talk with upper management of what was on the agenda. i learned that being a good colleague is the best thing because you are able to accomplish the job more integral. the workplace culture was very good for the reason when the holidays come around no matter from what department you enjoyed cooperating with others. the hardest part of the job was coming to the job and seeing chaos outside the store. for example, seeing the shopping carts all over the place and restructuring everything back together but it was part of the job and i never complained. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting discount in the store when going for food shopping or holiday shopping.",5,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Laredo, TX",10/3/17,2017,10,3

Overall can't complain,"This was an interim job for me going in. Cap team is responsible for taking inventory of merchandise coming in and replenishing shelves according to what goes out. Overall, was a fairly physical position that required lifting up to 30lbs, climbing up and down a 4 step ladder, and moving at a brisk pace. Favorite part was once you learned the routine you pretty much worked at your own pace in accordance with your schedule, oh and the hour lunch was nice, too. Only complaint was the pay definitely should be getting more then 11.50 hr. Managers and co workers were pleasant employee discount was a joke (℅10) unless you were purchasing a big ticket item. Not a bad place to work for a student or someone living with their parents, otherwise impossible to make ends meet.",3,Former Employee,Cap Team 1 Associate ,"Omaha, NE",10/3/17,2017,10,3

very busy environment,"A good overall experience.  Keeping up with the fast pace was rewarding. Workplace culture was directly dependent upon current supervisors.

"Flexible, but poor management and inconsistent.","When I started at Walmart, I was ecstatic. For weeks, I looked forward to the job. But once that ""new job"" optimism went away, I started to see how much of a train wreck the workplace was. With scheduling managers not bothering to check the schedules they generate, and the subsequent lack of coverage, I found myself being more and more irritated by the smallest things. Management is useless, often times never lending the hand they claim they will, or pushing simple jobs onto associates who already have a lot on their plate. Hours tended to work with you more than against you, as long as you follow the system. I was offered to go into training to become a member of management, but I couldn't stand the place anymore.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Customer Service ,"Wapakoneta, OH",10/3/17,2017,10,3

It is a pretty cool place to work out. You get to meet new people,"I work over in the money center so a typical day for me is just to cash checks, do money orders, bill payments. I've learned that everyone has a different personality. management was good. it could have been better if everyone worked together as a team. workplace culture was demanding, the hardest part of the job is having people talk to you any kind of way and not care because they are right. the most enjoyable part is meeting new people and making a difference in some ones life.",5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Birmingham, AL",10/2/17,2017,10,2
