"They don't want to make you full-time, so they don't have to give you benefits.","I have learned that Wal-Mart cares nothing about you or the family you're trying to support. if I have to call out because my child need to go to the emergency room, if you're not there that counts as an absence. even with a doctors note.

What's it really like at Walmart?,"Walmart is an excellent career choice for people who intend to retire from the company. Promotions and job changes are readily available if one's work ethic is sound. Unfortunately, though, that is not always the case. There is rampant favoritism among upper level management but there should not be a problem if you do as you are told, even if the directions do not make the most sense. Co workers are the best part about the job, as you get to meet so many people, and most of them come to work wanting to make a difference. The hardest part of being a department manager is not actually being able to manage much. Some assistant managers are not entirely competent in how they want the departments ran. While those issues can be quite frustrating, those with a strong work ethic and good interpersonal skills,skills in problem solving and conflict within the workplace will likely excel.",3,Former Employee,APPAREL DEPARTMENT MANAGER ,"Muskegon, MI",5/14/15,2015,5,14

My co-workers were okay, i mean we weren't exactly best friends but we were not worst enemies by no means either we just kind of communicated when it was necessary for work but we did not socialize beyond that, the hardest part of my job was the physical aspects of it, i was expected to push 10 carts at a time however being the size and weight that i am that proved to be a tad difficult for me so i settled for 5 and figured i would get stronger the longer i worked there and it would gradually get easier for me over time to start pushing more. I most enjoyed just  knowing I was making a difference no matter how big or small my duties were I knew that I was helping to make somebody's life at least a little bit easier.",3,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Hodgkins,IL",5/13/15,2015,5,13

Having this job as a cashier and sometimes a stocker made me learn how to manage my time with doing certain things throughout the day although I had different jobs to get done. The management before we opened was okay, but once we opened and they got close to certain people, they were unfair to many others. While working at Walmart,, my co-workers were very nice to work with when we were allowed to work in teams to get a job done.

The management was terrible when I worked there. As far as the company's goal to make money, they were on point with it but as far as caring and compassion for their employees, well thats a different story.

Assistant Manager,Being in management for two years has been a little up and down. Some struggles you may encounter is staffing issues in which you yourself will have to take up the slack as long as do your own job. The compensation and 401k plans are great.

Enjoyable work atmosphere,I worked for Walmart for 10 years. The first 5 years I was a cashier a typical day at work would start with counting my draw of money then helping customers check out. The last 5 years I was a customer service management (CSM) which included being over front line and four money draws of $400 each. I was also in charge of end of day reading. I learned how to do end of day reading on the computer and how to be in charge of a large group of people. I had a very good relationship with co-workers and management.

Productive workplace,"A typical day at Wal-Mart can sometimes be very busy but fun all at the same time, the place would be filled with laughter and smiles on some days and on others it would be a few frowns and upset customers. Some things I learned at Wal-Mart are that all actions don't deserve an reaction; sometimes it's best to keep some things to yourself. Wal-Mart's management is not perfect but it's not the worst either; there are some managers that think they're better then others then other managers that are absolutely fanatic. The same goes for some of the co-workers some think they're above everybody else then other co-workers are the absolutely best, some of us still communicate and socialize with each other. The hardest part of the job was trying to talk to an upset customer that was already upset before entering the store, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people. Sometimes we would meet people from New York, Connecticut and many more places.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Gaffney, SC",5/11/15,2015,5,11
Great for a temporary job,"I was fine with working at Walmart during the summer, but as for a permanent career, I would rather not. Most of my coworkers were ok and some of the management was pretty nice. However, the rest weren't so great. Some of the managers were rude and unfriendly. Also the general clientele attracted by this particular store could not be described as particularly desirable. Also, a stunt Walmart likes to pull is scheduling part time employees part time hours (32 hrs/week) for part time pay, but they expect employees to stay longer shifts up to 40 hrs/week, which also means no benefits or PTO",4,Former Employee,Overnight Cashier ,"Atwater, CA",5/11/15,2015,5,11

more appreciation from the customers than management,"I was assigned to Health and Beauty, the fastest moving area in the store because it covered all makeup and hair products, vitamins and cold medicines, body hygiene and toiletries and more. Most of my coworkers there were helpful and had the typical Wal-Mart attitude they show in commercials. I say most, not all._x000D__x000D_The store is terribly mismanaged with tons of backstock that nobody can inventory correctly, so we get stuck trying to put out tons of product with no room to do so even if we just tried to do this same task the day before. It doesn't help that certain managers will interrupt your work to tell you to keep doing it. It aggravates and wastes time._x000D__x000D_This aggravation is not the customers fault, and you must remember that they are the reason that you and everybody else has a job. I try to help them despite my work to the best of my abilities and knowledge. They appreciate it, especially when they see other workers talking amongst themselves and ignoring them._x000D__x000D_That is the most rewarding part of the job, because despite the pay amount, the internal aggravation sometimes is not enough to keep dealing with.",4,Former Employee,Dry Goods Instocker ,"Cleveland, OH",5/11/15,2015,5,11

Not too bad.,"Walmart would be okay for having a first job, but not trying to keep it long-term. I've worked at Walmart for a couple of years and ready to leave. My first month there was getting used to my job and then after  a year I switched job titles to learn something different. I stayed with that title for another year and a half. About a year ago team members would come and go, I would usually work with a crew of 4 or 5 a day, management would expect too much out of a small group. Now, I work with a crew of 7 to 10 people a day, and some have proven that they are lazy, though management has been better._x000D_My job has its ups and downs but I personally think its time for a new job and make use of the skills I've gathered.",3,Current Employee,Unloader/Inventory Management ,"Dallas, Tx",5/11/15,2015,5,11

I did what I had to do.,Walmart taught me that there are much better job opportunities available if I put myself up to it. My management was horrible because they never wanted to change my schedule and would schedule my break about an hour before my shift was over. My co-workers were friendly but I feel as though they could not be trusted. The hardest part of the job was that it was overnight and I barely had time to do anything when I got off work.

We had a lot of co-workers for help at first but they were lost after a while and had too much strain for new workers to deal with more advanced problems. We had to clean deli meat slicers, utensils, and cook wear every couple of hours. Which was fine as long as there were enough coworkers to back up while cleaning. We also had a lot  of logs to write for food and equipment. Usually ran out of materials:  gloves, meat slice holding bags, towels, other food presentation items.

Wal-Mart! Work more. Receive less.,"This company isn't even half as flexible as they expect their employees to be and they dole out minimal compensation while constantly increasing their own expectations. _x000D__x000D_I am in one of the highest pay classes in the store and still am making less than $10.00 per hour even after being with the company for three years. Apart from moving into a management position, the only increase in pay I have to look forward to is the newly revised annual pay raise which has changed from a minimum of $0.40 to %2.75 of what you make an hour which ends up being closer to $0.25 per year. Now they will give you a little bit more if you ""Exceed Expectations"" or achieve the ""Role Model' status on an evaluation however the problem with this is that both of these are practically unattainable. In my years of working with Wal-Mart and out of the dozens of people I've worked with I've only ever heard of a handful of people receiving ""Exceeds Expectations"" and supposedly someone knew a guy who got ""Role Model"" status one time and even if you did somehow manage to acquire one of these higher ranking evaluations, the difference in pay increase between them is only somewhere around $0.10. _x000D__x000D_When you start they might lead you to believe that you will be working in Hardware for example just like you had applied for and occasionally helping out in a few neighboring departments but after about a year of working there you will be passed around the entire store working anywhere and everywhere that they feel like having you and your hours and your schedule will pretty much be what ever they want them to be - more...",2,Current Employee,TLE Service Technician ,"Harrisonburg, VA",5/10/15,2015,5,10

Good place to work at just unorganized  not enough pay for the job asked,Wal-mart has been a good place to work at but a lot of things have become corrupt in the company.

As a department manager i  would think that i deserve more pay then someone who is just starting and only given the task to stock the shelf. Everyday i am going into work slaving just to come into work the next day and do it all over again. I don't mind doing it because obviously i need the money for bills and other things but if i had another income i wouldn't see myself working there anymore. Its not just one department manager that feels that way it is literally everyone who has the title of a department manager. We are all underpaid and now that positions in the company are being canceled more work is being pushed on us while upper management sits in offices and enjoys a cup of coffee everyday. Wal-mart as a job is good for someone who maybe doesn't need the money as bad or is looking to use up some free time but other then that it is not where you want to be if you want a career.,3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Walker, LA",5/7/15,2015,5,7

Toward lunch and dinnertime, however, the store becomes an almost mad house. I liked working during the busy time because it made the day go by faster._x000D__x000D_I'd say working at the Burnsville Walmart was a really good experience for me because, while not every single experience while there was that great, I learned a lot. I learned how to handle stressful situations while remaining calm and was kind of just thrown into my job without having shadowed anyone, so I had to be a quick learner. It was painful at first, messing up and having customers get angry, but over time, I learned to excel under stress and while other coworkers felt overwhelmed, I enjoyed it. In short, if you are not a person who likes to work in a fast-paced and stressful environment, this job is probably not for you._x000D__x000D_The management varied. Some managers were really good and friendly, while others disrespected and condescended those coworkers they were overseeing. I'd say overall, the management was alright.

I never had any big issues with any of my coworkers, except for the occasional annoying boy that tried to flirt with me._x000D__x000D_The hardest part of this job was probably having belated breaks of up to an hour.

Warehouse enivironment with high volume of work everyday.,"Typical night at work is getting in trucks of merchandise every night and stocking shelves. In the event that there is no new truck freight for the night, the backroom area has plenty of merchandise that can be worked to the shelves. I've learned valuable time management skills, and where to position people to have the best overall group success for the night so the team can meet the projected goal for the evening. We have several different managers that supervise overnight, I did not directly work with them unless inquiring about a special assignment. My coworkers are mostly helpful, but you are tasked with taking care of your assignments mostly by yourself. The hardest part of my job was just a lack of reliable equipment to use night in and night out. It can be challenging moving 3,000lbs pallets with poor and faulty pallet jacks. The most enjoyable part of the job would be that all of my coworkers get along which makes any job that much easier.",2,Current Employee,Head Inventory Clerk ,"Warner Robins, GA",5/6/15,2015,5,6

Walmart Review,"Overall working for Wal-mart is a good experience.  I learned many new skills and the benefits and open door policy is exceptional for a company.

The management at my new store are inconsistent and condescending when working with you.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager of Bakery ,"Eureka, MO",5/6/15,2015,5,6
It really depends on your managerial staff,"I worked almost 5 years for Wal-Mart. I never became full-time because they don't believe in giving full-time. I was hindered repeatedly by 90% Of the managerial staff, 75% of them didn't even know how to manage people. Wal-Mart hires managers from people who get B.A. degrees in Business. I have seen managers come and many more go. Unfortunely they recycle bad salaried managers to other stores for ""more training"". I haven't see this, we mostly see them get shuffled to another store._x000D__x000D_I had a few really wonderful managers who told us we were appreciated and had value.  This is very rare in Wal-Mart._x000D_I worked for a store where I made a family with some of my co-workers. I really missed them and had to find a job that was full-time and had full benefits._x000D__x000D_We saw young men being more valued, discrimination against older women, and young men who didn't do their jobs right and also had problems with disrespecting women not get written up or fired.

Nice place for a beginner job,"I worked here while I was 17, for seven months. It was my second job and I thought having a job at Walmart would be rare, given my gender and ethnicity. I was just a cashier, but I needed a job for my student loan payments.  A typical day at work consisted of clocking in, then finding one of those price things to scan my badge at, which would tell me what register to go to and run. I'd log onto the register, turn on my light, and stand for up to 5 hours (with one 15-minute break) checking out customers.  I learned how to process check payments with those weird little machines and process WIC payments as well.  The managers cycled through about as regularly as the staff, honestly.  I didn't really talk to any co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was constant standing, and people getting mad because their 50 cent or 25 cent coupons weren't going through.  The best part, though, was seeing regulars.  One day while I wasn't working, I went to my workplace to buy something, and while I was in line to check out, a guy came in and said, ""Hey, I know you work here, I've seen you before! Can you tell me where this or that is?"" I helped him and continued on my way.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Sherwood, AR",5/3/15,2015,5,3

Do Not Do It,Managers do not care about the employees and you get written up/fired for the craziest things. in the neighborhood market cashiers had to do everything. they want you to go outside in the pouring down rain and get carts then expect you to hop back on the register soak and wet. They expect you to perform all these jobs with little to nothing pay. the discount card sucks. you barely get a discount. Managers also have their favorites. so if you are not one of the favs ... And this is from experience at 3 different locations. I transferred to Sams Club from walmart thinking Sams would be different. NO. then i tried the neighborhood market thinking it would be different also. NO. all Walmarts are the same,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Chesapeake, VA",5/3/15,2015,5,3

False Advertisement For Their Employees..,"They say that when you are hired at Wal-Mart it becomes like a family and each employee can make a difference by making suggestions, and that there is always room for advancement.

About Cutting Corners,"They hire you for part time but work you full time hours.  They will work you 40 hours a week for several weeks, then throw in a 20 hour week so they can keep you at part time status to avoid benefits.  They bring you in for one position but pull you all over the place.  They keep it extremely hot in the store causing the employees to be soaked in sweat and uncomfortable.  Coworkers are all very nice to each other but management seems to have a I am better than you air about them even though most of them started in the same place you are.  If it were not for the fact the company focuses more on ways to cut costs to cheat employees it would not be that bad of a job but the only way to be treated right is to move up the ladder and the only way to do that is to suffer through them keeping your benefits out of reach, working in uncomfortable work environments, and being ok with being hired for one position but constantly being thrown into others because they don't want to pay to keep enough employees on the floor.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Porter, TX",4/29/15,2015,4,29

People just want to know that you are doing everything you can to make sure they are getting the best service possible. Ive also learned to listen more, it helped me to be more detailed oriented. I would cefinitely consider myself a team player. An operation goes much more smoothly if everyone is on the same page and know their roles. I enjoyed working with my co workers that was about getting the job done efficiently and excited to do so. The hardest part of the job is over working myself sometimes.

It was a presuctive work environment,"A typical day at work, I would clock in and have a 15 minute work meeting. The manager would tell us what we were supposed to finish stocking that day, how much shipping had came in that day, and what area we were supposed to zone first (zone means to straighten up).

Always something new everyday you work,"A typical day at Walmart would look like someone cleaning their register, getting ready for the day, or someone taking over someone else's register so they could either go home or go on break. You'd finish helping the customer, and if you took someone else's register and they forgot to clean up after them, you would then clean up for them and bring things back if they were surrounding the register. Walmart was my first job so I learned almost everything I know about working from working for this company. The management I had previously, before she had to move to a different apartment due to scheduling issues, was very understanding and was very helpful when I had problems with certain things. The co-workers are wonderful and helping and bring a family feel when it comes to work or to things that don't help with your overall attitude.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Cottage Grove, MN",4/28/15,2015,4,28

Fast paced environment working with multiple personalities,"A typical day at Walmart consists of doing an all management store walk, delegating out the notes to specific departments as well as following up to ensure they are complete. Ensure the customers are taken care of, replenishment is completed daily in consumables. Each assistant manager is responsible for a variety of offices and human resources and plays a part of scheduling, evaluations, merit increases, write-ups, staffing, clearing journals, attendance tracking, cash office management, and counting deposits. The hardest part of the job is that you are salaried and cannot plan a personal life at times depending on the needs of the business. The job can be rewarding but the only drawback is work family life balance. I learned a lot about operations, and how to manage different personalities.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Fontana, Ca",4/28/15,2015,4,28

My day @ Wal Mart.,"Wal Mart is a well organized company to work within...

I've always looked up to the managers for doing a great job in doing so.... For me I think the hardest part of this job was getting the dough to perform just right every time that I worked with it... Proofing the dough can be challenging.

After hearing where we currently stand I will try to fill in the blanks or cover breaks and lunches if need be. Other wise I will help the cashiers with the lines if any or work on putting returned merchandise back on the shelves. I get along pretty well with my fellow co-workers as I have been working with those in my department for the last 7 to 8 years. Management varies being that there are several managers and some are on call at different times and days. Sometimes it can get a little confusing because all the managers tend to handle and require you to handle certain situations differently.

Productive workplace,"Long hours especially during the holiday season. Family is not the priority. I've learned time management and counseling associates that don't make enough money or have healthcare benefits. Being micromanaged from District and Regional levels shortens your life span and causes gray hair.

Careless Management,"Being an overnight stocker at Walmart is not a hard job at all. Pay was average and I could put up with it. _x000D__x000D_Management didn't delegate their work well, however. Upper management could send you one place and then lower management would send you to another. If upper management asked why you weren't there and you told them lower management forced you into another area, despite telling them where upper management told you, lower management would act like they didn't know what you were talking about and upper management took their word over mine. _x000D__x000D_Training is not efficient either. I saw three employees get into trouble for not putting security locks on certain items, but they had not been trained to put security locks on anything yet. Everyone, even management knew they were new employees, yet they were put in a spot they had no experience or training in. It was an unfair setup._x000D__x000D_Management showed little care how hard working you were or how your home life was. Walmart being a family friendly workplace is a joke. They don't care if you've had a death in the family or if you've got a baby on the way. I saw two heavily pregnant women get fired while I was there, even though they were very dedicated workers. A lot of people claim it was because management didn't want to pay maternity leave, so they let those women go to avoid it._x000D__x000D_I've seen very obnoxious, irresponsible employees bumped up into management positions and hard workers cast aside, even in the most extreme cases, Employees falling asleep in their cars during breaks and coming in late, or doing drugs, or going - more...",3,Former Employee,Overnight Grocery Stocker ,"Jacksonville, FL",4/28/15,2015,4,28

Team Work filled of stress,"Great Company to work for, high satisfaction guaranteed for customers, good benefit, it offered fair open door policy to keeping a good relationship between members. However, failed to response to lesser details in providing honesty. Some of the managers are abusing the system in favor of  their own goods, rather than doing the right things.The work ethic or  policy is absurd, symbolizes ""a slave driver."" It is truly archaic, catastrophic the working situation at a certain  point in some stores; employees are being timed up to do their tasks, which are more often way beyond human ability or capacity just  to exceed their expectations.  Cashiers are being sometimes kept from doing their physiological needs, just to serve customers or to  get the cash in. A highly disparity rate in the way employees are being treated with respect to their race, gender, and nationality. The sick time eligibility is a joke, employee who is sick has to call out twice to get one day pay and has no right up to seven absences within a period of six months; otherwise he/she would eventually get discharged.   In fact, these above statements are not necessarily general, because some of the stores are different accordingly to the district or the individual in charge. And where the employees may receive positive feedback for what they really deserve. Overall, one cannot say this is the worst company to work for, because it has good and bad aspects or methods, such tendency one may find anywhere or in any other companies .

I understand when they are good fast workers but when help or the tools are needed they should be presented. the most enjoyable part is definitely seeing the satisfaction on someone's face when you know exactly where something they're looking for is, or just tell them have a great day!",4,Current Employee,fabrics celebratation & stationary sales associate ,"Austin, TX",4/25/15,2015,4,25

fun co workers but lots of favortism,"I'll be honest, right off the bat. While I agree that in my experience, the company is a terrible place to work, not all of the members of management are as I will be depicting them. I just had the unfortunate luck of getting into a store that was like this._x000D__x000D_The store I'm in is rife with un-professionalism (management talking about associates, by name, to other members of management, promoting their friends over people who would get the job done better, etc). We're a bit of a cluster____ at present and have been for the last two years I've worked here, and according to co-workers, it was better the first year we opened. (a year before I joined). We're up in profits and sales, and yet our quarterly bonuses mysteriously vanish. Hours are cut without explanation. You don't have the staff you need in order to get the job done, requiring you to do the work of two people in your department, in addition to the work of 6 additional people from other shorthanded departments. Management will often speak in disrespectful or sarcastic tones as well.",1,Former Employee,"Cashier/Customer Service, stocker ","Holly Springs, NC",4/22/15,2015,4,22
Hard to find good help,I liked my time at wal mart. The culture changed a lot during my 10 year tenure. The biggest problem is they don't give you enough payroll to get everything accomplished. It's also very hard to attract high quality workers.,3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,GA,4/22/15,2015,4,22
A family environment with people who care,My typical day consisted of doing a million things but overall I loved working there because I learned so much and management allowed me to expand my knowledge and learn new things from different departments. I want to learn every aspect of my job so that I dont have to depend on anyone for answers and can assure the job getting done without delays. I always get along with management and co workers.

Friendly fellow employees and helpful management,"Every day at Wal-Mart was a learning experience.

Disorganized planning,"The job started with a very thorough computer training program, which taught me a lot about what I was going to be doing in my position. But once I began, I ended up being expected to do many other departments' work, and learning new store functions on random days, only to compensate for a short-staffing. _x000D_The mangers were; over-booked, stressed out, and spent a lot of excess time re-planning projects or re-assigning associates from one task to the next._x000D_I did learn a variety of department store functions while working for this Greenfield Walmart.

Would not recommend,"Walmart sucks. Worked there for 3 years overnights and was only making 10.80 an hour. And this is a multi-billion dollar company. What a joke. Not paid enough to deal with the moronic, micro managing managers. Always understaffed so you have to pick up the slack. And then get yelled at and written up when the ridiculous expectations aren't met. Isn't worth your time and effort.

It has good benfits but no opportunity for advancement,"I worked at walmart 8 years total,was never offered a promotion.

Terrible place to work..,Walmart supervisors were very rude to the workers and were often very unorganized and rude to the customers as well.

N/a,Wal-Mart wasn't the greatest place to work for in my opinion. It was like pulling teeth when you needed to take off and you have to fight to get a promotion. It didn't feel like there was much of a place for advancement and the management didn't treat the associates very well.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Hondo, TX",4/22/15,2015,4,22
Not a great place to work,I worked for Wal-Mart as a Customer Service Manager for a year.  I was surprised at the amount of drama that was allowed to occur daily at my job.  Assistant Managers and even the store manager did nothing to stop any wrong doing.  I loved my job besides the drama.  I was terminated due to not having a schedule.  The computer system messed up a ton of employees schedules at the Wal-Mart I was employed at and because I didn't have a schedule to come into work the store manager terminated me over the phone with no warnings and no coachings.  I warn people to be wary when applying here.  They don't really care for their employees and the turn-over rate here is extremely high because of that.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Central Square, NY",4/22/15,2015,4,22

Review of Walmart,"While I enjoyed working with my co worker and serving customers I had some difficulty with management. I did not feel that management wanted to invest any effort on there employees. I was a cashier most of my time there. I would run register, the service desk and do some stocking of shelves.",4,Former Employee,"Cashier, Accounting ","Easton, MD",4/22/15,2015,4,22
Not a good experience,"Walmart is not a good company to work for if you are wanting a full time position. I started working for Walmart as a cashier and was told up front that I would not be allowed to work more than 34 hours a week, part time only. They do this so that when your 6 months are up as part time, you can make a REQUEST to become full time. Once that request is granted, if it is granted, then you get to work another 90 days before they have to offer you insurance. How fantastic is that?! They treat you like you are worthless and below everyone and the shifts you are scheduled to work are ridiculous even after you have given them your availability limits they schedule for whatever they feel necessary. Once I find another job, I am leaving Walmart and not only will I never work for them again, I will probably never shop there again either.",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Ponca City, OK",4/22/15,2015,4,22

Busy,"The thing that I enjoyed most was working with customers and my co-worker's. I least enjoyed that change in department managers. The new department manager came in from a department, she was real messy, had 0 respect from employees, always lied on employees, and always threw off her work on her associates. I learned different skills that I could take to another job, I also learned how to teach myself new things around the deli because most of my training when I got there was inaccurate.",2,Former Employee,Deli Sales Associate ,"Prattville, AL",4/22/15,2015,4,22

Gives experience but has some issues,"Working at Walmart gave me more experience in customer service and quality of work being done. It was great when I first started. I would always greet customers with a smile and say hello to make them feel welcome. I would sell and fix items, as well as make the place look nice with the time being given. We always put out new merchandise, so I would help process and put away the items. My two best friends are co-workers of mine. They are great. My other co-workers are fine to work with, but there are some who choose to create problems and drama. In some cases that made some co-workers of mine cry, and I also have experienced it. I would go to my management about it and we would have a meeting or a sit down about the situation, but then a few days to weeks later it would repeat. It became like a broken record, to the point where I have had enough. Management didn't know how to deal with situation either than just talking about it. That was the hardest part of the job. The enjoyable part is helping others and making friends.

Walmart Department Management,"A typical day as an apparel department manager can be challenging. While there are duties and functions daily that are required and can become tedious, there is usually new and improved ways to develop the department. Management overall is supportive, they encourage a teach and train mentality that they themselves follow. Co-workers are helpful, friendly, and supportive, they always take the time to assist when needed. The hardest part of the job is often dealing with issues stemming from managements scheduling conflicts.

Not a great company to work for,"Selling firearms, customer service and zoning mostly. I learned a lot about firearms and the differences between them and how to tell them apart. Management had a tendency of being too stuck on themselves and didn't treat their workers below them at equals. Most of the co-workers were very easy going and great to work with it was the management that has personal issues and treats workers as less than people. The job itself wasn't that hard except for when you had stuff to do and 3 different managers would pull you in all different directions. I loved selling firearms and working with people.",2,Former Employee,Fabrics and Crafts Sales Associate ,"New Hartford, NY",4/21/15,2015,4,21
High stress work environment,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in, then finding my manager to get my tasks for the shift.

Fun experience working 3rd shift for the first time.,"Working IMS 3rd Shift, I would go log into the store system to see what items in the backroom need to go out onto the floor which would take about 3 hours.

One of the best places to work but...,"Wal-Mart is considered one of best jobs to work for a reason. The benefits packages are amazing, they train you for everything to advance you in the job market, and the culture is excellent. But, the only downside of it is that the management and in order to put yourself in the supervisory status is that you have to take a test that you can only take once or twice a year. Other than that, I would definitely work there again.",4,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Catonsville, MD",4/21/15,2015,4,21
Productive and fun workplace,A typical work day would be fun and productive.  I learned a lot when it came to retail and how to develop skills and knowledge to progress and move up in the store.  The management was very productive in many different ways when it came to scheduling and running the store.  My co-workers are very productive as well and does what it takes to keep the store operating smoothly.  There is really no hard part of the job honestly if you enjoy doing what you do.

The WORST company to work for,"I have worked at Walmart for several years. At my store, the management is non-existent. They do not address your concerns, do not listen to suggestions to help improve working environment, and barely ever come check to see how the day is going. I was the only person working my position in my department, and they did not hire anybody to help me for over a year. When they finally did hire someone else, they would not put them on the schedule with me so I could properly train them. I applied for a department manager job in another part of the store, and they did not give it to me because I could not be replaced in my current department. The same thing happened when I applied for a transfer to another store altogether to get away from the management. I was told I could not leave until I had a replacement, which is likely never going to happen. I am currently looking for employment outside of Walmart altogether. Avoid working there if you can!",1,Current Employee,Cake Decorator ,VA,4/21/15,2015,4,21
Not the best place to work,"Co-workers were great. Management on the other hand didn't listen to the worker's ideas and complains, even when the co-workers were losing their stuff in the store they didn't do anything about it. They didn't care about customers either couldn't help the customer because they didn't know anything where things were in the store.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"North Bergen, NJ",4/21/15,2015,4,21
Well maintained workplace,Walmart had some of the better benefits I've had with a job. The schedule was steady and consistent and the workplace was well maintained. The only draw back is that with all the different managers you could have 1 to 8 different people telling to do different things and they may not all communicate.,4,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Franklin, TN",4/21/15,2015,4,21

Overall,Walmart Overall is not a bad place to work it just wasn't my favorite place to work. I was always stressed out and tired while working there. There was lack of communication between different departments and the managers lack of knowledge on all the departments made things a little frustrating when they have managers switching areas every so months. Also every once in a while there would be issues with being short on staff in one department to where others from a different department are working in a different one for there shift and some unsure on how to do that specific job. The only thing that really made me get through it was the fact that I made some good friends while working there and they really helped me stay motivated on getting the job done.,4,Former Employee,People Greeter/ Meat Department ,"Montgomery, TX",4/20/15,2015,4,20

Decent until you can find something better,"I enjoyed my actual work but the people made it very difficult. One thing I wish I didn't do was express how much of a hard worker I was. Once you do this you get taken advantage of very quickly. I was often given tasks to complete in other departments or tasks that I weren't responsible for including assignments assigned to managers. I did appreciate the benefits given to part time employees such as 401K, stock purchase program, insurance, personal hours, etc.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lithonia, GA",4/20/15,2015,4,20

It's a great place to work especially if you're a people person. The people I worked with were great everyone looked out for eachother which made it even better.

This job is not for everyone,Before Sam Walton died walmart seemed to care about there employees treated them with respect... Well at least more respect then they do now. When I first started I wanted to learn everything I could and move up in the company. At first it was great loved the people I worked with. Then about 3 months into it I noticed it changing and I realized that to become higher up was not what I wanted. No one was on the same page. You where constantly told to do one thing by one manager then get in trouble for doing it by the next. When it was brought up that the other one said something the other manager would act like they didnt know what I was talking about. I worked in a lot of different areas in that place and it was all the same. I did meet some great people while I was there. I do have to say not all the management was bad.

poor quality work enviroment.,"there is no fun with this company. this is the first job that I had, that I did not desire going to work. I quite this job because the pay was way too low for what I was used to. also the managers were not friendly or professional. once I was overdue for my lunch break, I had been working for 6 hours and the system locked me out. instead of my manager sending to lunch, she logged me in under her number, and mad me keep working while she clocked out and went to lunch. what kind of moral is that? once I had to close at 12 midnight, but was scheduled to come back in at 6am, I didn't even get 5 hours of sleep.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Rep ,"ellenwood, GA",4/17/15,2015,4,17
"So much freight, so little help","Typical day at work: The new freight goes out quickly and it is not difficult. I'm usually done by 2am, lunch time. Back from lunch is usually overwhelming. Picks from the stock room are overwhelming most times. Sometimes more than the new freight from the night. Less time to put the freight out and no help available. Time goes too fast and I usually have to move extremely fast to keep up with the time. I only have two hours left to put out as much as I did in the three hours of the beginning of the night. I finish this and after last break I begin to zone my isle or department. I am an excellent zoner. Management rarely checks me as it is always done with excellence and they have such confidence in me. I may work 6 or more pallets of 20-70 boxes each. I never bring any freight back to the warehouse without making sure it is overstock. My co-workers are wonderful people who pull together to get through the nightly crisis. We usually work with little or no assistance and have few employees to get through the heavy stocking load nightly. The hardest part of the job is not having enough help. Having to do so much every night is like running a marathon or saving yourself from a drowning situation. Sometimes I forget to breathe. The most enjoyable part of the job is realizing I perform seeming miracles every night. Managers at work rely on my ability to achieve impossible goals in a reliable manner. I am frequently put onto the more difficult task of the night. I have learned that  I am great at crisis management.

No associate moral,"Wal-Mart Management lack associate communication skills. Hardest part of job is when Management ask for task to be preformed  properly , yet they do not have supplies to complete tasks. When Supplies are ordered they do not arrive in a timely matter..ie. proper floor wax stripper , dust mop heads , plastic trash bags , ect. I ordered an industrial dust mop for the floors due to metal sleeve being broken and was told by Asst. Manager to use duct tape to fix the broken frame. I had ordered frame 3 months ago and when I left WalMart it still had not arrive....Everything I had heard negative about Wal Mart was true. I was embarrassed to say I was employed there...  Nothing enjoyable about working there.",1,Former Employee,Maintenance Worker / Shelf Stocker ,"Escondido, CA",4/17/15,2015,4,17
Professional atmosphere that practices a culture of team work and understanding,"Walmart Stores Inc. Global Shared Services of Charlotte is a great place to work.  The upper management not only preaches, but also practices the 3 basic beliefs: Respect for the individual, strive for excellence, and service to the customer.  I typically get to work between 7 and 8 AM.  I check my email and put together a task list to be completed by close of business.  As issues arise, I tackle them on an independent basis.  The most difficult part about my job is sometimes juggling what is a ""fire"" and what is an ""issue'.  Because my job is to insure that a machine is running properly, it is more reactive and associates believe that their issue should take precedent over anyone else's.  However, the need is determined through proper troubleshooting and communication with the associates.  However, where this sometimes is the most difficult, it is also the most enjoyable.

They don't always train their associates. There are computer based learning modules that give and overview of what is required for specific positions but once on the sales floor it's often a sink or swim environment.

Great place of business.,"Walmart is a great place to work. They offered me the Assistant Store Manager position out of college. It is a salaried job and they expect a lot from managers,which is understandable. I learned to adjust to the different levels of expertise in each store and even every department inside the store.

It's not too bad, you can climb the corporate chain if you put forth the time and effort but you'll always be nothing more than a cog. I have no real complaints and no real compliments. The people you work with will determine how much you enjoy the job, but in the end it's all about perspective.

Good place to work if you get in the right store.,"This was a good company to work for. I learned that some stores are run more efficiantly than others.  The management team I worked for the first 10 years were great, the store manager set the guidelines based on Home Office directives and everyone followed them.  At the last store I worked at they were not like that.  The management team did not work as a team, which made more work for those of us down the chain.  I believe because of this last store and other stores run in the same manner or worse is why new directives had to be made.  To many rules to keep the company from being sued.  _x000D__x000D_I liked it not being a Union place to work.

The managers made it fun to work and we got paid for it as well as the customers were great and some not so good.  I learned to deal with good attitudes as well as bad ones.  Managers were great back then they would help you out work as a team with you.  They teach you a lot so you can move up in the company.  Management come and go you have good ones and some not so good.  The hardest part was not being able to help the associates with their concerns about problems in their area.  I spoke with management and they didn't take the concerns seriously.  The most enjoyable part was to see my associates get promoted and than they would come and say thanks for telling them to hang in there and not give up.

Walmart Deli,"Wal-mart fails to understand they need staff to run the store to increase sales.  I frequently work alone in the deli.  Turnover is VERY fast due to poor treatment of employees, and demanding too much work for 1 person to complete.  Due to the customer intensity and lack of coworkers there are times when breaks get delayed.  It is one of the worst jobs in the store due to how demanding management is and no help.",1,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"beavercreek, oh",4/13/15,2015,4,13
Very Poor Management,"When I was hired as a sales associate for Walmart I was rather excited to be starting a new job, but after about 2 or 3 weeks I realized that Walmart has very poor management. There are way too many people *In charge* and not enough people who will  actually do the work, leaving one skilled person to do everyone`s job for them as a result. Management does not train new employees to do their job correctly, such as ordering, or using what is called a handheld (Gemini) etc.. and also does not train their cashiers. I was placed at a register with about 15 minutes of supervised training, and then left to *figure it out* for myself (this includes learning all of the codes, and cashing checks, money orders, etc.. This also goes for the photo department, and learning how to do layaway. Not to mention their very low pay for over-worked employees.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Crescent city , CA",4/13/15,2015,4,13

Unorganized and undermanaged,"A typical day at work consisted of cleaning, organizing, moving product to the sales-floor, and assisting customers. The management would often assign tasks outside of the understood responsibilities, including some tasks that were dangerous or physically difficult to complete, and would expect the tasks to be finished in a ridiculously small time-frame. The backroom team at this particular walmart were sloppy at best. This led to inefficiency in moving product and assisting customers.

"It was a job, you got a paycheck, this will be the highlight of my review","When i first started everyone told me the same thing ""they will act nice for the first week or so but after that everyones attitude changes, badly."" where to start... The management is ok at first like they said after like a week I had worked 5-6 times but i was still training and they kept putting me on different isles almost every night so it was impossible to get familiar with the placement of product, well thats when it all changed. I started noticing the managers doing some very....questionable things... They would be peeking around corners of isles just sitting there watching. And i never did anything wrong I followed rules I did procedure so i had no idea why they were doing this. Come to find out they do this with ALL their employees of course except the ones they liked. Which became very prominent to me very quickly. Another thing that i and 99% of my co workers felt is the timers were unreasonable and down right undoable. Each task at night you have a certain time and that isnt unusual im used to that what im not used to is having 3-5 pallets with over 5-7 ft of product a piece which would take me around 3-6 hours to do give or take depending on the department and size of product but you would be given 2-3 hours for this much work. then after that 2-3 hours is up youd start to be hounded by management until your done and trust me they will make sure you know they are displeased with your speed. Let me put this into perspective, there are people there who have been working for the company for over 5 years and I would ask them how much time this should/could take and - more...",3,Former Employee,3rd shift stocker ,"Dalton, GA",4/10/15,2015,4,10

Good place to work but has some flaws,I have been with this company almost 5 yrs on and off left for a couple years to finish out college not planning on coming back. After graduating with a bachelors I was hoping to find any job that paid well. I couldn't find anything but my old store took me back and have been there almost 3 years. One thing that annoys me is that a degree to Walmart means absolutely nothing and I still had to start out at the bottom even though left on good terms when I left. Been trying to move up to be an assistant manager but its very hard to even get recognized by other stores I've learned after applying to other stores and most my assistants at my store now are no help and  I am lost what to do. I would like to be appreciated more.,3,Current Employee,IMS Supervisor ,Kansas,4/8/15,2015,4,8

My overall opinion is with the specifc location not the entire company,A typical day would be okay depending on who you worked with and what upper management would be on duty that day.  Certain upper Management at the Grassfield location other than the Store Manager had issues with Micro- messaging and excepting feedback or ideas from employees lower in title.

overall pleasant working conditions,"Unlike Walmart U.S. Continental , Walmart International has a tendency to underestimate their employees capabilities and focus more on presentation (dress code).

Sucks,"Political only if you want to move up be friends with management. You will do others jobs as they watch on.  Managers are always on your back. Sucky hours. They will take credit and pass the blame. No job security at all. Manager say they have your back then they will stab you in the back. Your hours will be cut. Barely enough pay. There are some good managers but they don't last long. Some of the other employees are really nice and will help you out.  If you make one mistake it could be your last. Don't work if you have a better job. If you have to, don't stay for long.",1,Current Employee,Frozen Dairy Sales Associate ,"Kankakee, IL",4/8/15,2015,4,8
Advancement oppertunities,"The job had its freedom to create your own timeline of how long it took a particular job to get done. Time management was most essential for this job. My main duty was to stock grocery shelves. I also unloaded  refrigerated  skids of grocery products  to the appropriate coolers in the store. At lease once a day this was needed of me. I was also assigned different odd jobs outside of my assigned daily duties as the store needed. I have worked on seasonal displays, stocking other departments, picking products, and  helping at the registers. All other jobs were as needed per management. I worked with a very fun energetic group of people through out the store. Management was very to the core with values they were to uphold per Walmart's 10 step goal. I was constantly thanked for things that were expected of me and for things that were not as well. So many times management would help in picking up slack on the floor and assist employees  on making sure the job would get done. Id say pretty much every aspect of this job was really enjoyable. I loved the atmosphere the hard work of all the people I got to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I had the ability to move up in the company.  Also the open door policy that Walmart has is absolutely wonderful and very comforting as an employee.

It changed daily which is fine. There was only two managers that come to mind when I think of a professional stand point. They other ones seemed a little childish when it came to holding that position.

WalMart Review,"I didn't mind working here. In fact, I only worked three days a week, because I put myself in that position. I was still making, decent amount of money every month, and that was fine by me. All, but a few people, liked me. I don't know why they didn't, but I treated them, the way they treated me, with disrespect. What I learned while working at WalMart, is a lot of things about managing. The hardest part of the job, would have too be staying up all night, and sleeping in all day. I didn't mind it, until my mom invited company over, and then I couldn't sleep in the day.

Work has become ritualistic and the culture calcified with more years worked the essential badge of honor,"Lots of talk about innovation and change; however, it's more like the shouts of food from a starving man and water from a thirsty man.  Work for the majority has become ritualized with the 20% doing the work.  Little accountability which is supported by the musical chair of job rotation every 18 months.  Middle Management is weak although enough talent to bubble to the top.  The culture is calcified and can be a challenge for integration - learn the language which is a interesting mix of ITIL, Project Management and sprinkles of theology.

Walmart's pay and benefits were also very nice. What I did not like about walmart is the hours and organization that they had. One day you would be working 2nd shift and the next day you would have to turn around and work 1st shift. The computer did the schedules and when you brought your schedule up to a manager they would tell you to see if an employee can switch shifts, if you couldn't find anyone willing to trade shifts you would have to work it.

Powerful Retail Company Foundation & Structure Misaligned,"My longevity with this company has been a bittersweet learning experience in terms of personal development and professional development.

There actions made it blatantly clear that they were your boss and not your friend. They seemed to always be looking for a reason to complain. I felt discriminated against in this company. Co-workers weren't to bad but the strictness of the management caused co-workers to be mostly there for themselves. That is they seemed to always be looking for reasons to complain about other co-workers so they can get ahead. These actions were detrimental to the team effort that was expected.

Not very employee friendly,"My experience at Walmart was horrible to say the least. A typical day consisted of constantly covering for other employees who would go on frequent breaks exceeding one hour in length.

Aside from the difficulties finding someone to cover me on my breaks, I had been given several warnings about taking breaks on time, however could not go on break until the other employees returned from their breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer service, which gave me the ability to leave my post at the fitting room and walk around. My experience with the co-workers varied; some co-workers were very pleasant and taught me how to do my job, while others would simply expect me to pick up their slack. Some of the managers were very good to the employees, as they would explain things clearly and help when needed.

"Fairly interactive job, many cool co-workers, and savings.","My typical day would consist of setting up shop at one of the many registers and helping the customers by ringing up their purchases, and answering any questions they may have had to the best of my knowledge. Each day seemed just a bit different in the regard that you rarely had the same customer more than once through out a weeks time frame so each interaction with your customer in that time frame was in essence different. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job was the quirky co-workers that I was able to chat with in between aiding the customers. not to mention a full hour for your lunch break each day, that you could take at your leisure; all you need do is inform the CSM (Customer Service Manager) in your area that you were going on your lunch and then to flip your Number light off for the time being. A cool thing that you would get to learn from your customers is what ""Price Matches"" were big at the moment (In case you're new to Wal-mart's price match policy if you find a product that they have somewhere else for cheaper wal-mart will match the advertised price) and if you happened to find  one ya liked you were at liberty to take advantage of that once you were off the clock.",3,Former Employee,Sales associate ,"Sturtevant, WI",4/2/15,2015,4,2

Hopefully they've gotten their acts together since I left.,"Walmart was the first big job I was hired into straight out of high school. At the time, it was the worst. The amount of disgruntled customers was ridiculous, which turned into being lashed at daily for things out of my control, no matter where I worked. Since it was my first main job, it taught me how to run a cash register, how to read UPC codes, being comfortable with the general public, and where items were located. What I was NOT taught or warned was the amount of ridicule I would receive from not only customers, but the occasional manager for 'not working hard enough'. I was placed in the Pharmacy by accident as a cashier, and discovered that the amount of disgruntled customers were located there. I was constantly lashed at for insurance or medicine issues out of my control, despite me attempting to calm the customer and explain that it was not my doing. I switched to the midnight shift to leave that, but it was no better: I became sick and was not able to work to my standards, but one of the managers constantly was on my case about it, threatening to fire me weekly for not working hard enough. I was expected to put away 8-hours' worth of work in 2 hours by myself (at least 4 pallets with 16 large boxes each of unsorted merchandise), and was scolded when I would ask for help from someone who was mostly finished with their work.

What I learned was that people are very different and that I had to treat each person as an individual (including the customers).  I do not have a lot to say about the management. I became an at work, work friend with a few of them. For the most part, most of my co-workers were easy to get along with and were easy to supervise. I let them know my boundies from the very start. Even that there will be times to enjoy our work as well as taking our jobs serious.  The hardest part of my job was when, on several occasions that I was well qualified to move forward in the company they held me back from promotions. People say it was because I did my job too well. As far as my job being enjoyable, It really was. I had a very good relation ship with the associates as well as the customers. One customer had said, ""When I walk into the store and do not see you, they asked another associate if I was working that day. If I wasn't working they found out when I was then left and came in when I was working"". WOW! That made me feel really appreciated.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Waukegan, IL",3/31/15,2015,3,31

The work itself was fine but management was frustrating,"The work at Walmart was fine, my coworkers were great to work with, we had an amazing overnight team. However, the supervisor would rotate and you would end up with one supervisor for 2-3 nights, then someone different, etc. Every supervisor had a different way they wanted things done, so every 3 nights or so you would have to completely revise the way you were trying to do your job. It would do no good to try to explain that there might be a better way of performing your duties. It was frustrating at best, down right maddening at times.

They only have two maintance for the entire store. People have to work in at least 3 departments every night. They fire people for the most arbitrary reasons like calling off for one night and constantly cut hours. Everybody makes mininum wage , even overnight people are only making 9 dollars an hour. It's completely ridiculous how they conduct business and treat their employees.You are constantly disrespected by managers there's no common courtesy. The company makes you lie and say it's absolutely wonderful working for them but that is far from the truth.

Our store's morale is rapidly declining. our store manager never has a kind word to say nor does he ever tell you that you are appreciated. When he does speak to you he makes you feel very unappreciated and you can't talk to him like you are supposed to be able to do. All together I've been with this company 9 years and every year it gets worse. I have learned that just when you think you've seen/heard it all someone proves you wrong. I love the majority of my co-workers. They come in do their job and don't complain.

Mostly customer and sales oriented.,"With my experience as a Walmart associate in two different stores, Walmart can be 'just a job' for most who have been employed here. Of course, friendly and fast return Customer Service with any customer and sales oriented business is a Must in order for the company to survive. Walmart is huge nationally, but so are their employee turnover rates. It is my opinion that Managerial experience, care, concerns, and priorities are very important where associate/ employee turnover rate is concerned. My first 4-5 yrs as a Walmart were my best due to management that cared not only about his associates and their well-being, but implemented a positive teamwork environment which resulted in a lesser associate turnover rate, positive associate moral and associates that held real smiles, liked/ loved their jobs, and carried a true positive wilingness to help eachother, a clean and organized store, high sales, fast and friendly Customer Service in all departments, resulting in AWESOME returning customers and sales.

Walmart: A place that can go either way,"As a merchandise supervisor, a typical day at Walmart usually consists of scanning your areas to make picks from the backroom, checking to make sure you do not have any returns at customer service that need to go back to your areas, price changes, and modular updates for the most part. The co-workers are what make this job fun to work at sometimes. You can meet some great people to work with. Management may or may not be the same. I like my assistant manager over the areas I work fortunately, but I actually dislike most of them. The toughest part about this job boils down to when it gets really busy/stressful on the weekends as well as the exceedingly high expectations that management has. It is typically unreasonable in my opinion as it is usually one person(me) having to do the work of, say, three or four people. The pay is unfortunately not that great, which is also tends to stress me out as well. I would say that Walmart is overall a decent place to work at if you're using it as a base to start off your working career. I would probably not recommend it if you want to use it as a long-term job unless you can manage to get promoted to a management position.",3,Current Employee,Merchandise Supervisor ,"New Lenox, IL",3/22/15,2015,3,22

The first few months was getting into the groove of things, often training with others to understand what you were doing in that department, as well as others. The management, at this store in particular, was a bit hard to get along with, as most were fresh, and very by-the-book. However, after some time, things eased up again, before they switched managers around for new training. The co-workers, by far, were the most enjoyable part. Easy to get along with, as well as something to look forward to when you knew you had to go to work. The most difficult part is keeping up with the suggested times for each department, and how long it should take for you to finish the work there. Often times, the most enjoyable part of the day was being able to relax after a big truck, and sit and chat with co-workers, or any customers in the area.",4,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Overnight Sales Associate ,"Colorado Springs, CO",3/20/15,2015,3,20

Productive and fun workplace.,"I really enjoyed my time working at the Walmart bakery. The management were encouraging, and my co-workers were friendly.

My First Retail Management job. I learned much in my time there.,"After a few months of training, I began At the Seekonk MA store as an Assistant Manager. Having been hired from outside the company (most new A.M.s worked there way up through the company), I had much still to learn. I began in softlines, moved to domestics and hardware while in Seekonk. I transferred to the Fairhaven MA store, where I was put in charge of the Front-End. That includes all the cashiers, Customer Service Reps, Service Desk, Door Greeters and Shopping cart/ carry out asssociates. I also was responsible for the cash office (that requires counting the outgoing deposits daily). In total this was about 150 associates in my charge: by far the most of any other Assistant. I was responsible for scheduling them weekly, completing annual reviews, and of course getting to know them, and their work habits, so that I could better help and coach them if necessary. _x000D__x000D_I got on great with my co-workers; and I had good relations with the overwhelming amount of my associates. A typical day was From 7AM to 5PM (minimum), unless it was a Store Closing Schedule, that was from 10AM until after the store is cleaned and organized after closing.  I love dealing with people, so customer service and interacting with my associates was certainly the most enjoyable part of this job. The hardest part was probably when I became to the Overnight Assistant. We didn't train in the Backroom, so I needed to learn much about how all the processes worked from my non-salaried manager, while still being ""in charge"" of over 50 associates._x000D__x000D_Early on, at Seekonk and Fairhaven, I had great managers that - more...",3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Seekonk, MA",3/19/15,2015,3,19

Very strict workplace,"A typical day I would clock in, and go to start to push carts all day. It was my first job, so I learned how to communicate with customers and interact with them. Management was in order. The only thing I have to say about that, is whenever you asked management something it took them weeks to answer you back. My co-workers were some good people, some of them did their job very nice, and some didn't do their job at all and you had to do double your job to pick up their slack. The hardest part of my job was pushing carts, cleaning bathrooms, unloading the trucks, and helping cash register all at the same time.

I also learned a lot of discipline being a child you can do what you want but in the work force there's always somebody you have to listen to and respect. Most of my managers were very great people they taught me a lot of lessons that will be able to last me a life time. Most of my co-workers were teenagers such as myself some were a little more immature than others but I just made sure my job was done. The hardest part of my job was probably lazy co-workers who slacked off making things harder for the workers.

Chaotic work environment.,"The job it self is pretty easy and does not require much thought. Management is definitely an area Walmart needs to review and make stronger. Management shows favoritism to employees with seniority.  My coworkers who have 1 or more years under their belt do little to no work in my department and is left for the new employees to pick up the slack. Three of my coworkers in my department have great work ethics and i believe if management is not changed Walmart will be without some great working employees. My day to day tasks are cleaning, preparing deli platters and party trays as well as cook the assorted foods on the hot bar, and last but not least serve customers, some great others not so much.

No thank you. I would not recommend working at Wal-Mart in Jasper, AL unless it is the last option. If you work 8 hours, you are supposed to get 2 breaks and an hour lunch. I didn't get one of my breaks and I asked my manager about it and she said ""We don't have to give you your breaks."" They do. I'd like to see what our store manager has to say about that.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Jasper, AL",3/15/15,2015,3,15
A job at Walmart is good.,A typical day at my job is people yelling at me because is priced wrong or they want to bring something back to the store and they can't because they don't have everything they need to return something to the store. I learned to be patient and kind and try not to wear how you feel on your face because that can turn into something else. My management team didn't really communicate like I would have hoped but they still expected a job to be done so I had to make sure it was done even if they didn't really step outside the office. My co-workers were friendly and very helpful in the training process of my job. The hardest part of my job leaving at the end of my shift because I love to work with people and I get a good work flow in I like to stay until everything is closed and  finally done correctly. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to come in the morning or afternoon and start it all over again.

Poor AP structure after that. LP manager is more operations oriented now. They are hiring assistant managers as LP managers. Poor management at times, poor management structure. The store manager seldom gets out of his office, the assistant managers are glorified stockmen and are overpaid. The store manager is waay  (sic) overpaid. Customer service at night is a joke. Most of the full time people work day shift and most of the people working at night are cashiers, and too few of them. The store is filled with good people who are overworked, trying to make due in a bad situation.",4,Former Employee,Asset Protection Coordinator ,"Ashland, KY",3/15/15,2015,3,15

The management team oversees that the company objectives are met and co-workers work hard to meet the expectations that are at times very difficult . The hardest part of the job is corporate constantly changing the daily routine and not really talking with the workers for there opinion, they are sitting in a chair at cooperate level not really knowing what is going on at store level.

It was hard to stay on their ""good side"". If a task was done well, it went unacknowledged. But if a job wasn't completed to their liking then you would either be written up or at the very least warned. But I did have a fantastic relationship with my co-workers. I liked all of them. We always found ways to have fun and still keep the day going. The hardest part of the job was the schedule. It was different every day. If i wasn't working late at night then it was right in the middle of the day. I have a toddler so it was complicated to have sitters lined up to accommodate my insane schedule.

The amount of work that was expected to be completed by an hourly manager was ridiculous. It seemed nearly impossible for two people to complete, let alone one individual. There were very few opportunities for advancement or pay raises. Overall, I was blessed to find a higher paying job.",2,Former Employee,Receiving Manager ,"Springfield, MO",3/12/15,2015,3,12

Customer service setting,"While I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart, and they were extremely flexible with me because of my outstanding work ethic, I had to leave because I acquired a permanent disability to my leg due to cancer and could not stand for long periods of time any longer. My managers did everything in their power to keep me, and that is why I stayed for so long, but inevitably it was a job that required you to stand for 4-8 hours a day and though I was a high functioning individual, my leg could not keep up that pace any longer. Also, Wal-Mart corporation as a whole did not do much to take care of their employees. With low pay and sparse benefits, it was difficult to maintain a decent living while employed there even though I had it better than most. I was respected because I came in and did whatever was asked of me without objections, provided input when asked, and could find jobs that needed to be done without being asked first. That led to me being asked to be the training coordinator and ultimately to being entrusted with the position of fundraising lead because I could still accomplish my daily work while maintaining the fundraising schedule. The hardest part of the job was careless management and rude customers. Many times the job of making things right with an unruly customer fell to the employee because the manager would refuse. We had a great track record of fixing things that were within our power to fix. The best part of the job were the people you meet.

Take out the management and Walmart would be a great place!!,I really liked the job itself. I had to stock the fruit and vegetables and  take out all the bad stuff it was real fun for me as weird as that may seem. I also liked the people in my department they were all really friendly and welcoming. However the reason that I gave it such a bad rating is that the managers were all horrible. There are so many of them all different levels telling you different things that aren't even relevant to what you are doing. They take you out of the place that you are trained in for the store because they don't have enough people to zone the shelves which is a waste of time and leaves your area short as well. It was great when they would just leave us alone.

I worked with people in my age group on a regular basis.,"When you work for Walmart over night stocking the shelves, you must bend down onto the floor from a standing position to ground level repeatedly to stock shelves. This is a routine that is carried on for the whole shift through out the night. Even after you stock the shelf you must then organize the shelves then repeating this routine, to make the store look presentable. You must stay clean, organized and throw away any and all trash. It is practiced when possible to recycle when you can, even with damaged items. At the end of the night you restock freight you had no room for and work your inventory. I had to use a fork lift that you walk behind, a motorized pallet lift, pallet jack, utility knife, scan gun, printer, computer, shrink wrap, recycling wires, shopping cart, large plastic bag, pen, pencil, marker, gloves, jacket, printer paper, and sticker.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Indiana, PA",3/8/15,2015,3,8
Very productive workplace with some of the best co-workers ever,"A typical day at Wal-Mart can sometimes be very busy but fun all at the same time, the place would be filled with laughter and smiles on some days and on others it would be a few frowns and upset customers. Some things I learned at Wal-Mart are that all actions don't deserve an reaction; sometimes it's best to keep some things to yourself. Wal-Mart's management is not perfect but it's not the worst either; there are some managers that think they're better then others then other managers that are absolutely fanatic. The same goes for some of the co-workers some think they're above everybody else then other co-workers are the absolutely best, some of us still communicate and socialize with each other. The hardest part of the job was trying to talk to an upset customer that was already upset before entering the store, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people.

Flexible but extremely stressful,"Wal-Mart is  good if you need to have a flexible schedule for school. However as a company, they are on the bottom of the basket for customer service. Turn over is too high, why is that? People who shop at walmart get upset that there isnt enough help. So they take it out on the people who are there. Not smart! Low prices come with consequences. The company is raising pay for newer employees who are vastly under paid. What about the other managers? 11 dollars an hour to monitor 30+ associates, schedule there breaks and lunches, listen to complaints about things you have no control over?_x000D__x000D_If were out of distilled water, then were out of distilled water.

"Easy to get hired on, Fair wage","Working at Wal-Mart provides the basic work environment in the costumer service field. Helping customers, stocking, straightening up, etc. In my experience there is not very much training with your appointed manager you are given tasks expected to accomplish said task, but are not given proper training on how it is expected to be done.  Wal-Mart does seem to have a very open door policy to who they hire have now raised their starting wage, and work with your choice of hours for your schedule._x000D__x000D_With Wal-Mart hiring almost anybody they seem to have a high turn over and expect those who do stay on to carry the work not done by lack of staff. It is also very hard to be fired seemingly the only reason being is not showing up for your shift to many times.

Experience is luck of the draw,"When I started at Walmart, I had a Store Manager who would be the first to jump on register, cover the can room breaks, go outside and push carts, help stock shelves, and meet with customers and employees for pretty much whatever was needed. Management sent everyone birthday and Christmas cards in the mail and found ways to reward hard work through gift cards and free meals. And then corporate transferred our store manager to another store and the management team basically fell into shambles. People were being forced to stay overhours to cover other shifts because there was no replacements for people that had left and new management's response was ""People can stay over and cover it."" In a 4 week period of time, we had 6 managers quit due to how things started to be run under the new store manager. My point being, Walmart CAN be a very pleasant place to work, IF you have good managers. For the better part of my time with them, I did, and I enjoyed working there. Most of the hourly employees are very friendly people. Even after having left I still get hugs every time I go in the place. The pay was poor but if you work in retail and expect to be making a large sum of money you are going to be very disappointed. My biggest complaint though is it took 6 months to get my pay increase for being promoted due to ""training.""",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,Iowa,3/7/15,2015,3,7

You don't have to reapply with the company for that position. You would just have to speak with that manager and ask for the next training class. A class that work around your current shift you have.,5,Former Employee,Cashier/ Stockperson ,"Orlando, FL",3/7/15,2015,3,7

Intervention Status o Walmart,"Average day was always with a high-functioning system adapting to employees and customers and all treated as equal and like individuals. Upon orientation, I had learned what it meant to be an individual of a workplace that demands its customers always be served with satisfaction no matter how that it is to be done.  I had not much in management except to get a feel of a managers position by performing duties that were more of a rendezvous of higher responsibilities and what being a manager of a super retailer meant to the community.  In addition to my job duties, my co-workers were not as attentive or seemingly interested in their position so I tended to take over and be doing more than one's work to show my initiative and that I deserved the job more than they did being abundant with my performance apertures.  Truthfully after all is finished, being so hard working, I would say the hardest part was going home because I loved being there more than home due to how sociable people were in comparison and how I was treated also.  Finally, the most enjoyable thing about the job was simply being able to make a difference in the lives of both customers and my manager(s), supervisor(s) with a sense of humor and fulfillment as an individual working in a place of a great shopping experience.",4,Former Employee,Unemployed/Student ,"Lake City, FL",3/4/15,2015,3,4

They are constantly out of produce that they NEED on the sales floor to fill out empty spaces and because those spaces aren't filled management isn't happy and they begin to pile on the pressure for you fill what you cannot. It required a lot of heavy lifting, pushing, and unloading incredibly heavy pallets full of produce merchandise. every 3 to 6 hours you would have to throw away about 200 to 400 pounds of rotten or bad produce and that was the worst.

Action packed never a dull moment.,What an awesome opportunity to do what I have done in the last 10 years as a Regional Compliance Manager for the nations largest retailer.  Every day was so different.  I had responsibility for half of the state of Tennessee.  Duties included teaching and training at facility level various topics that could be deemed a risk to our business reputation.  I had the opportunity to work with many individuals that exemplify good old fashioned values.  A typical day might include driving to Nashville to work with a store manager to teach various processes.  I think the hardest part of the job was not being able to immediately realize your accomplishments.  What you teach today doesn't show immediate value until they need to use those set skills.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with such high caliber associates.,5,Former Employee,Regional Compliance Manager ,"Knoxville, TN",3/4/15,2015,3,4

good place to work if you like to work with people or the public,Walmart was always very busy no matter what shift you worked. The management team was ok.  Some of the management was bias and it showed.  The hardest part of the job was not really hard as much as it was frustrating and that was having to use 2-4 different registers in one shift not knowing who was on the register before you so you could be held accountable for someone who was dishonest. I love to work with people that was the best part of the job for me.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Rome, NY",3/3/15,2015,3,3

A good work envirnment without alot of complications,"Coming to work was not bad due to good co-workers and a pretty decent environment. I've learned to communicate and become more vocal throughout the process of this job. Management was rather complicated. Though I expect leadership from a manager, some confuse that leadership with direct and demanding commands. Some of which a lot of people would call inappropriate. My co-workers are the best part of my job because If any additional help that I couldn't understand, they provided exceptional information that helped me get thru any assignment at hand. The workload required is fairly implied on sum nights. There were a shortage of employees, so most work nights was rather tough. Additional help was not guaranteed so the task at hand was that much harder.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Lancaster, TX",3/3/15,2015,3,3
Productive and hard working,"A typical day at work, You wake up in the early mornings around 3 am to 4 am and be on our way to the Farmers Market.

After about 2, as everyone left the farmers market, we clean up, put everything in the Uhaul truck then go home! I've learned that in order to hand customers come to your area, you and your fellow workers must be at the top of our game and be right there to help and serve our customers! I have amazing co-workers, we all help each other to get the job done and we all will do what ever it takes to get the job done right!

Walmart has its ups and downs in their stores.,"I would have to move back and forth between my register and areas I had to front and face in the store.  Most customers were friendly while a few could be difficult to deal with.  The management was dependent on the district management and the general management of the store.  Sometimes the management was great, and others it was alright.  Co-workers were usually friendly, but because of the low rate of pay and benefits the turnover was high.  When the customers were friendly it was fun to talk to them.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Elberton, GA",3/3/15,2015,3,3

Walmart,"Working at walmart there was always something new, which was exciting, i enjoyed being a cashier, having the constant contact with our costumers. I also enjoyed working in the bakery, fixing the french bread and all the bake'd goods. I always felt like i never knew what to do because there were so many people telling how to do the same thing so many different ways, and when i was working in the bakery i   didn't the training i thought that i needed. i was left alone way before i even felt comfortable on what they had me doing. There was no real hard part of working at Walmart other than i just was unaware of what they wanted me doing, there were too many employees there at one time, which was clogging up the front end, and the management was aware of many inappropriate situations and still did nothing about them. The most enjoyable part of this job was doing the store set up. Build the inside of the store the way that they wanted. i enjoyed setting up the check out stands and well as the isles.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Colorado Springs, CO",3/3/15,2015,3,3

Fun and friendly place to work at.,"Everyday I learned new and different job duties. I learned how to properly handle money, and different types of checks. Also I learned how to answer the phone in a professional way and how to page people to their departments. All of my coworkers were very friendly and the managers were also very friendly and were able to work with our schedules. My biggest challenge was getting used to paging people to their departments because I had to repeat my self several times and think of a proper way of to page their names and departments. The most enjoyable part of my job was how I got to know people so much in such a small amount off time and how many different people I got to know and how they would always remember me as a friendly person and a person that would make their day wile they were almost done with their shopping.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Kennewick, WA",3/3/15,2015,3,3

Horrible Work Area,I worked her for a year and it wasn't until I hit my year mark that I found out I was eligible for health insurance through them way before my year mark approached.

people are lazy,working at Walmart you learn quick how the employees are. i have watched countless times employees mark down 20 dollar items for 89 cents. no matter how many managers you tell they say they will take care of it and literally do nothing. I've seen this first hand multiple times. Another thing is there customer service. They are straight horrible. What is the point of great prices if you cant enjoy going into the store. Every time you turn around there is nothing on the shelves and the employee is NEVER in there spots. Don't get me wrong Walmart has very good prices but! but if it were up to me the attitudes of every employee would change. There are some very nice people out there but i don't think great prices is what shopping is all about. and can i ask why Walmart isn't even run by the family of Walton's anymore? or at least that's what i heard. and why does everybody always wait to the last minute to get things done? get it done before the big bosses come around so your not killing the employees getting everything clean and ready for them to come in.,3,Former Employee,Produce Clerk ,"Chesterfield, VA",3/3/15,2015,3,3

Pharmacy was always rewarding,"I always enjoyed my time at Walmart pharmacy. The day was always extremely busy which made the day go by fast. The job also taught me humility and compassion which you wouldn't necessarily think you would get from just ""typing and counting pills."" As a company, Walmart was, for the most part, good to work at. In the pharmacy, you're kind of left to do your own thing. The only problem I had was at the last store I worked at, the store manager put patient satisfaction over state law. He made the pharmacy override, fill, and sell a controlled drug that was too soon because the patient was not happy. I left soon after.",2,Former Employee,Registered Pharmacy Technician ,"Naples, FL",3/2/15,2015,3,2

Productive and high energy workplace with high morale...,"Stepping into Wal-Mart at the start of my shift was always a great feeling. I enjoyed company meetings which provided the employees insight as to where the company was as far as numbers were concerned in how well we were doing as an overall team. The meetings also set goal expectations. Having Wal-Mart employees as my co-worker's was pleasing. We gained respect for each other and knew how to be team-player's. You could always count on someone from management to be understanding and to be there to guide you when a task wasn't understood. The hardest part of the job was having to climb the ladder only because I was scared of heights. The enjoyable part of the job was being at the job, being around wonderful, supportive, energetic co-worker's, and being able to help customers and seeing them leave with a smile on their face-knowing they left satisfied.

"Laid back and comfortable work space, team work, and good communication.","A typical work day consisted of a minimum of four pallets to work for your area. Zoning, restocking merchandise, trash disposal. While working there I learned that if things are not executed the proper way it throws all you time frames for your objectives. it can also throw off the objectives for employees through out the day. Management communicates on a constant basis so that all employees are aware and on the same page. the hardest part of the job was ensuring all pallets and trash were off the floor before store opening. one of the more enjoyable things to do on shift is attending the 3 a.m. meetings after lunch. I would recommend this position for parents in need of opposite schedules.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Philadelphia, PA",3/2/15,2015,3,2

Fast paced environment.,I start my work day at ten o clock at night. Pick product out of the back room that can go on the shelves. Unload the dairy an frozen truck an stock the product. Averages about 15 to 20 hours a night of work that has to be done by seven in the morning. So its 3 to 4 other workers an I who manages the fasts way to get the job done. Once product was finished being stocked I then bin it into the backroom bins which is Walmart's Inventory System. Keeps track of what we already have in store so the system knows to order what were missing. I've learned to articulate my thoughts to get my point across with multiple types of people an personalities. Even some that clash with my own but has to be put aside to finish the job.

"Productive, Fast-Paced Place to Work","A typical day at work for me was very fast paced. I was busy from the moment I clocked in, and I enjoyed that. The first thing I did was check the lines to make sure none of the cashiers were overwhelmed. Next I would head into the back to unload whatever pallets came in the night before or during the day before my shift started. When that was finished, depending on the amount of pallets and the time it took to unload them, I would usually begin to stock the shelves with the new merchandise. If there were a lot of pallets and it took a while to finish them, I would move right on to doing 'picks,' which is essentially checking the system to see what merchandise shelves are empty and then checking in the overhead bins to see if we had any of that particular item in stock. If not, I ordered more. If so, then I would 'pick' the item out of the appropriate bin through the system, and fill the shelf. I was typically part of the closing shift, so once picks were done I worked with other co-workers to prepare the store for closing. That involved janitorial duties, checking the register scales, and bringing in all outside displays. Any merchandise that didn't make it onto the shelf during my shift had to be labeled appropriately and placed onto a cart for the next shift to handle. For me, the hardest part of my job was dealing with the store manager. She appeared to have taken a dislike to me, and made subtly derogatory comments aimed at my weight and the speed with which I walked (I would like to note that my walking speed is perfectly acceptable in my opinion, and my job was always - more...",4,Former Employee,Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Oriental, NC",2/28/15,2015,2,28

Great job for part-time workers and first time workers,I've worked at Walmart twice in two different stores. The first time was my first job I had ever had. I enjoyed it. It taught me howto manage my time. Like I said I've worked in two different stores but the experience at each one varied. One store had a lot of drama due to the type of people they hired. The management in one was great they would work with you if you had school or another job while the other one the management was rude and mean. The hardest part of working at Wal-Mart was dealing with the various attitudes throughout the day and the way they schedule your work week. The most enjoyable part of the job is it teaches you patience and builds your understanding and personality through your daily interactions.,3,Former Employee,Front-End Cashier ,"Dallas, Texas",2/27/15,2015,2,27
Productive workplace,"A typical day at work would begin with a meeting at 10PM where the managers told us what needed to be done at what time it needed to be done. Then I would start my night by down stacking pallets of merchandise placing the boxes in the aisles they belong in. Next I would start in the aisles I had been assigned in and stock the merchandise, after I would clean up my area by picking up boxes and removing any trash and pallets off the floor for customer traffic. by the time I finish cleaning up, the store would open at 5AM and I was assigned to the cash register. If I was not assigned the register that night then I would ""zone"" the aisles I had been assigned meaning making the merchandise look presentable and face forward to be easily viewed by customers. I have learned many things working for Walmart. I learned how to use the cash register, down stack pallets, and I was the only person in my area of the store that knew how to do ""break packs"" for the over the counter pharmacy section. My coworkers were very helpful and I made a lot of friends working there. The hardest part of the job was when the store always over ordered and we ended up having 2 people responsible for 72 hours of freight needing to be worked. Not including cleaning up and zoning the store.

It is what it is,"Wal-Mart is fast paced and expects 110% every day.  Staffing is always short, so you can expect to be the only person in an area, even during rush times.  Management was hit or miss- especially the higher up they got.  Every work delegation felt like an ""or else"" threat, especially knowing that the employees there had no other income.  The pay was minimum wage, and scheduling was strict.  My mother was in the hospital for a week and after missing a day it was brought to my attention that any other schedule deviation would be met with a write up.  For the constant stress and pressure brought by the management, the frustrated customers were even worse.  It felt impossible to make anyone happy.

I was constantly learning things about all different departments , including my own , and had to learn about every new product we started carrying . _x000D_The management was the real reason I no longer liked working at this job . Management is suppose to be there for you to turn to when you need assistance on something you cant figure out , well more times than not we managed our selves and ended up knowing more than they did about their own department . My co workers were fantastic , every time we got a new member it was like just adding on to our family , created great team work skills and problem solving thanks to the people I worked with . The hardest part was having to send a customer away unsatisfied , whether it be them having a hard time with a different associate or simply them being frustrated because we did not have what they needed .

Everything I learned at this job was to make my customers happy._x000D__x000D_As the title states I would give Wal-Mart a negative review in everything. I'll start with job work and life balance. There really wasn't any balance. I was a soft-lines associate according to my job coding that meant I would work in clothes, shoes, and jewelry. Jewelry only as needed. However this is not what I did. I was constantly pulled from one area to another. I was at several points pulled up to cashier without any training, scheduled in jewelry, sent over to zone in other areas, and at other times pulled to other areas than I was scheduled within the clothes areas. What I'm saying I was constantly doing the job of at least three to four people on a daily basis. This doesn't make for much of a balance of anything._x000D__x000D_Now on to compensation and benefits. From the day I started to the day I was let go I never made much more on my pay checks than I did from day one. Even though I had received raises my hours were constantly being cut the longer I worked there. As to benefits I wasn't eligible for benefits as part time until I had worked there for two years and the benefits that were offered were a joke.

Okay first job,"It's an alright first job, but I would not consider Walmart to be a great long term job commitment for anyone. I can not speak for all Walmarts, but the one I work at could use some serious help. As far as sales go and the overall look/layout of the store, I would say that it is better than most, however it has it's own share of problems. I feel as though management has a hard time getting on the same page. When problems arise between workers or just for one specific worker, it seems as though it takes a very long time for them to come up with a resolution, if they ever do. I don't agree with the training either. I feel like training has just been a lot of ""throwing associates to the wolves"" and just expecting them to learn everything on their own. Depending on what they haven't learned in training, this sometimes leads to termination for meal violations, poor communication, etc. I also think that it is wrong how workers are treated. Hard workers seem like they get the work of those that choose not to work and, in return, never get rewarded. While workers who do not do enough work, or don't do the work that they are asked to do, end up being talked about, but never disciplined for what they are doing which over all makes work more drama-filled. I personally think there are far too many faults with Walmart to enjoy working there. As I said though, I only know what I have witnessed at my own store. All Walmarts are not necessarily the same as the next just because of management, bad conduct, etc.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Kendallville, IN",2/24/15,2015,2,24
Over all experince,"I have learned a lot while working for the company. Since starting in 2007, I have worked in just about every area of the store. I have worked in the electronics department, wireless center, hardware department, been the pharmacy and deli department managers. They definitely allow you to move up in the company if your a hard and dedicated worker. The only problem I have really experienced with them is just always being short staffed and them expecting miracles to happen.

A fast paced and demanding work environment made more difficult by too many members of management,"A typical day started at 4pm, we would set up the back room for unloading the truck. Placing pallets in the appropriate areas for freight coming off the truck. We bring in the rail in to slide freight down the line. Some one would go into the trailer and place each individual item on the line and push it down. Once the item in question was on the line it was taken off to the appropriate pallet, representing sections of the store, lawn and garden, electronics, apparel, pets, etc. Once the truck had been cleared of freight, the rail was taken out and typically we'd go to break. After a fifteen minute break we would usually split the crew up, some working on sorting freight and apparel, and the rest going to the grocery back room to help them unload their truck. Once it was 8pm we took an hour lunch and came back at 9pm. At nine we had to pull out all the pallets to deliver the sorted freight to the specified departments for overnight stockers to work. Once all freight was brought out, we would clean up the back, and move any back stock out of the way for overnight pickers. Depending on the needs of the day we would then either help the Inventory Management team with picks, or the stockers with their freight. Every Saturday and Tuesday we would do a pallet truck, filling one of the empty trailers with extra pallets the store had accumulated. We were also responsible for making cardboard and plastic bales. Work day typically ended at 12am or 1am.  Management was hit or miss. Some managers worked with us and others felt like they just made the job harder.

You take the cardboard and plastic wrappers rom the freight and put them in their own separate bags. Pull pallets of overstock off the floor and into their own bins. What I learned at Walmart was customer service comes first. If something drops you pick it up and put it where it belongs. My co-workers were amazing. U can be a team with the people you work with. I have made some amazing friends working for this company. everyone gets along. the ones you don't get along with you just leave alone. The hardest part of my job was in the very beginning. I had no idea what to do and I didn't have a good trainer. Management was amazing. I had the best managers anyone could ask for. If you ever needed help they would be right their to help.

I liked a lot of my supervisors and stayed strictly professional with not so enjoyable managers. Co-workers were basically all good people. I get along with everyone so it isn't hard to find friendly people. I'd say the hardest part of my job was a particularly arrogant manager who decided to make me his work horse.

Advancing in the company can happen, but only on a very small scale to the average employee. Possibly moving up from cashier to cashier manager with a small pay increase if any pay increase at all. The customers are just like customers anywhere when working with the public. Some people can be rude and others are nice. Overall, I learned that there are enjoyable parts of the job but making a living is very hard with this job.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Starkville, MS",2/20/15,2015,2,20
"Adequate working conditions, but very unhappy employees","This was a brand new store, so things changed quickly.  I enjoyed my position as a customer service rep, however when rules and policy was enforced, there was no management to back me up when working with unhappy customers.  After the Holidays were over, they cut back on all temp or seasonal help, and therefore my hours were decreased.  I opted to leave at that point as I traveled 30 miles each way to work and for only the 4 hours they offered me it was just not worth the trip.",5,Former Employee,Customer Service Walmart Super Center ,"Tigard, OR",2/20/15,2015,2,20
"Busy workplace, lots to get done with few tools and associates.","My job was anything but boring at Walmart, I worked with a lot of people. Both customers, fellow associates and managers. I was responsible of a wide variety of areas and expected to know a great deal of each of them. I was also tasked with training our new associates with how to complete their own tasks and make the sale and provide quality customer service. This was not an officially appointed task, but one passed onto me due to lacking quality of the current designated 'trainer' for my area. That wasn't the issue, I loved the busy work life, training new associates how I want them to get things done. Though there were things that were out of my control, associates who had been there longer who were just lazy. Skeleton shifts the entire week, with mounds of work to get done, and really only just myself to work it. I was given very little time to actually train my associates, once or twice a week with each individual and I don't feel as if that's a sufficient time. Especially when my senior associates would train them themselves, it was counter productive to what I wanted to do. Over all, I love the work load Walmart can offer me. Though the lack of management and organization was plain and I didn't have the job title to really do much about it.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Midvale, UT",2/20/15,2015,2,20

Daily review,"I would come in and greet my coworkers and talk about sports, music and the workplace. After the short conversation, I'd begin to load my cart with merchandise and being my shift. As the day began, my coworkers would start to wake up, fully. The managers would come around, and ask certain people to do certain assignments. Throughout the day, customers would come in and have mall talk with me, some of which were regulars and they knew me by name, and not just because of my name tag.  My day at work was usually enjoyable, and fun. However, making bales was awful, because its a thousand pound bale of cardboard.

Customer Service?,"Management insists that customer service is of prime importance, but they do everything possible to keep from living up to the verbal commitment. There are not enough associates on the floor to provide a good level of service. It is not clear to customers how to go about obtaining the services needed and any limitations there might be on the availablity of such services. The low pay and constant harassment of the first-level supervisors mean that anyone able to escape will do so. The quality of the first-level supervision negatively affects the motivation and satisfaction of associates., In spite of it all the associates on the floor are usually helpful to each other. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the frantic atmosphere generated by unreasonable expressed expectations, which may not jibe with actual realistic expectations.

The company has a knack for training you for a position for 1 - 2 days after stating that training will last 2 weeks, throwing you to the wolves, and, then, yelling at you for not being able to perform the job you weren't properly trained for. Furthermore, regardless of state labor laws, they feel they have the right to terminate your employment for whatever reason they deem necessary. My reason was due to illness, which, in my state, isn't a viable reason for termination. Unfortunately, my state is considered a right to work state meaning I couldn't sue for wrongful termination.

Most days the work load is to high. Management needs to work more with the associates instead of giving out large tasks and telling the associate to ""just figure it out."" There is also little to no training at Walmart even though they tell new hires you will receive a job coach and two weeks of training. The main portion of training is done on the computer and through videos. Also management will require you to work overtime, but you must take extra long lunch breaks off the clock to kill your overtime accrued.

The inventory system is not well implemented.,The inventory system is not well implemented. There are products that are missing from the shelves and are not stocked. Many products are also overstocked. Employees are required to empty stacks of products to see if products can be put on shelves. Then products that can not be put out are inventoried and placed in the back storage. This is the first inventory of products delivered to the store. To me all products should be inventoried when entering the store to check for theft in transit and them theft from stock.,2,Former Employee,Temporary Remodel Associate ,"Dunkirk, MD",2/15/15,2015,2,15

Hard mindless drone work,"A typical day as an unloader consists of coming in to a short staffed crew and being expected to do the impossible without the proper help. A good unloader crew at the store I was at would consist of 5 people, one on the truck unloading and 4 others taking merchandise off the line and palletizing it by department. On any given day, we were lucky to have 2-3 unloaders and were expected to unloaded a 3000-4000 piece truck in less than 2 hours. Management wouldn't allow us to take breaks at the same time, so instead of stopping the unloading process for 15 minutes they would slow it extremely for 45 minutes or more at times. You are unable to come up with ideas on how to make things more efficient because management will write you up, ""coach you"", for any out of the box thinking, mainly because it makes them look bad. The work itself is fairly fun and great for keeping you in shape. But when it comes to any chance of advancement, there is none unless you suck at the job you were hired for, If you are good at the job they will refuse to advance you in the company because then they would be losing a person in a position that can actually do the job. So my advice to anyone thinking about working for Walmart would be do the job but don't put your heart into it, and if all works the way it did in my store you will be management in no time.",3,Former Employee,Unloader ,"Clinton, NJ",2/15/15,2015,2,15

"fun work place, fast paced, great co-workers",A typical work day for me would be cleaning the bathrooms every two hours. If I have any spare time I would go around the store and pick up garbage or help cashier. I have learned many different ways to clean stains off walls and other objects and to be more talkative. The management at Walmart is really friendly and very understanding if you have to leave work early or call in as well as my co-workers they are always there for you if you need help with something and are great listeners. The hardest part about my job is getting into the mens bathroom to clean it. I don't really enjoy anything about working at Walmart besides the people I work with and the costumers that just know how to make you laugh.,4,Current Employee,Maintenance Associate/Cashier ,"Fond du Lac, WI",2/15/15,2015,2,15

Awful.,"Management consists of rude, arrogant, unhelpful, and unreasonable people. None of them ever have anything nice to say, are consistently sarcastic and rude. Workers are clearly unhappy with their jobs, when asked is because of the poor treatment by upper management. A typical day consists of relentless pushing a prodding, despite how quickly and effectively you do your work. The crew itself is nice, with friendly and outgoing attitudes, though they are always brought down by the management coming down on them like a ton of bricks. The hardest part is definitely trying to please the management. They are never happy with your work. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you finally get to leave, as they typically keep associates long after they are scheduled to perform several other tasks.",1,Current Employee,Support Manager ,"Amsterdam, NY",2/15/15,2015,2,15

Better employee treatment for the morning and evening shifts,"A typical day at work starts with an employee meeting lasting about 20 minutes. Then the overnight stockers might help unload the tractor trailers and separate and take the merchandise to the appropriate departments. Afterwards, the stockers fill the shelves in their departments with all of the newly arrived products then any empty areas are filled if possible with the older merchandise that is stored in a backroom. Finally all of the merchandise is neatly pulled forward on every shelf. The overnight shift is expected to work extra fast compared to the other shifts as there are fewer customers. This results in workers being timed for the fastest speed possible but there is often unfair treatment leading to higher turnovers overnight. This also leads to lower moral overnight compared to the day and evening shifts; their is a huge split between overnight management and the lower level employees like that of the rich versus the homeless class. The co-workers are similar to most minimum wage companies in that  some like the job while others do not and this is subject to a large variety of personalities.  The hardest part of the job is trying to keep pace with the expected time to finish the entire workload. This often leads to better annual raises for other shifts.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"El Paso, TX",2/15/15,2015,2,15

Wal-mart has the potential to be a good company to work for,"Wal-mart is one the largest retailer in the country which mean they employ thousands of workers.  A typical day at Wal-mart for me as a floor associate would be making sure the department where I worked is clean, the merchandise is organized correctly on the shelves and to make sure customers are able to find what they are looking for. Wal-mart has a store manager, 2 co-managers, 4 assistant managers who each have their own area.  These areas are then broken down by the zone managers , the department managers and then the areas are assigned to the floor associates.  Because we have so many managers things can be a little chaotic when communication is not done properly between hourly associates and management.  For the most part my co-workers are good associates. I think the hardest part of my job is poor communication from management and their slow response time with customers who need their assistance.  The best part of my job is being able to help customers.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,Hammond IN,2/14/15,2015,2,14

Great place to work,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work. When in training we actually got the chance to be informed about the culture and how Wal-Mart came about and it's a great way to meet people and just make a better day for people. The only downfall I believe for Wal-Mart is the compensation for employees. For people with large families, or even single moms and dads, you are not able to live off of just being employed with Wal-Mart,  you would actually have to consider a second job and then that takes away from family time also.",5,Current Employee,Agent Customer Care Representative ,"Fort Worth, TX",2/13/15,2015,2,13

Just Work for Getting By,"Wal-Mart is just a place to work if you want to get by.  It is not a bad place to work say if you're attending school or if you are looking for your first job, but it is by no means a place to make a living or to find a career.  It is a fairly fast-paced environment that is very much customer service oriented, with well defined roles and expectations for its positions but low wages and little compensation for the work that is done even, for those in supervisor positions.  The work force is generally understaffed and there is always more than enough work to go around.  Management is helpful and co-workers are fairly enjoyable for the most part but there are always a few exceptions.

I can't really speak for the store manager he arrived shortly before the season ended. My co-workers were always willing to chat and help me along the way in my experiences in a new environment.

Management for the most part was lazy and only came to check on what the regular associates were doing like once or twice a day. The hardest part of that job was dealing with my fellow coworkers. The easiest part was dealing with the customers themselves. I learned a lot from working there. For example, I learned one must have patience when dealing with people, and everything will not go your way.

Good company with areas of opportunity,A typical day at Walmart requires you to come in to work and first look at your numbers and identify areas of opportunities. Follow up is very important. Making sure that you are well stocked is a challenge because of the labor restrictions that is why following up and setting expectations is so important. I have learned a lot working here mainly thinking outside the box to get goals accomplished. Management here are hard working and most are customer focused. The associates here are also good people and they have good attitudes and are happy to do what is asked of them. The hardest part of this job is finding a balance between your work and life.

"Productive, multi tasking, good environment","Working for Wal Mart was a great company to work for. I worked in the deli. In my opinion the deli was one of the busy departments of the store. A typical day in the deli started by making sure everything was clean, second putting rotisserie chickens in the oven, then we would open the deli and begin serving costumers. We serve costumers at the hot case which consists of the hot food we cook, and we serve the costumers at the slicer where we cut meat and cheese. While making sure all costumers are taken care of we prepare food like sandwiches, soups,salads,hot dogs, and many other lunch foods. I can honestly say that everyday i worked i would learn something new, weather it was how to order, use different equipment,how bin. I am a very hard worker and can work in any work environment but it is always nice to have great people to work with, my former co workers ended up becoming like family. I believe it is very important to have good relationships with the people who you work with. I feel the most enjoyable part of my job was that i always stayed very busy.

I was to clean them all at least once a month. I learned how to remove the shelves and the proper way to clean all the equipment that made the shelves work. My co-workers stocked the groceries and their job was somewhat more difficult than mine, so I had to go out of my way to show my appreciation of them and be part of the ""team"", even when I didn't feel like ""part of the team"".  The most enjoyable part of this job was in having the satisfaction of knowing that our customers would be present in the morning to see clean shelves and not be afraid to buy our product. It was a good feeling. Although I did not like cleaning, I did enjoy making customers happy and satisfied.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales ,"Juneau, AK",2/8/15,2015,2,8

On slow days, they would have me greet all the customers coming in giving them a cart if they needed it or not or even the electric cars for the older or the people with bad knees or what not. And ALWAYS helped those that needed it with whatever they had to carry to their cars. I also, while greeting people, would put back the items customers did not purchase and the exchanged clothes. I always kept myself busy and if I could think of nothing else to do, I would ask my CSM what she would like for me to do. Usually involving fixing and putting away clothes and even stock all other items. I would also sometimes work the electronics and jewelry departments. Then sometimes, because I've got a lot of upper body strength, they would even have me in the back loading/unloading everything from clothes to furniture. I learnt that I am capable of adapting to different departments and that I am very well rounded. Management there was pretty great. The only thing I did not like about work at Wal-Mart was that, if you needed a certain day off, or few days, you would have to enter it in their computer which the time that I was there was only once, I was positive that I put in the exact date that I needed off and they would not change it for me when I realized what had happened.

We would start our shift off by picking products out if our inventory system from a list that was made showing what all was needed to stock the shelves in the store. This would continue on for approximately 4 hours then it was lunchtime (1 hour). After lunch a process of binning items into the system started up, this consisted of all ICS associates to go to the main floor and grab all overstock items ( excess items) and bring them to the backroom where ICS would scan the product label, change the item quantity to what was in the box and neatly stack the boxes in to steel bins.

Judgement day,"Wal-mart has price matching, which can make it very difficult to judge a persons character especially when trying to maintain a quick accessible line in order to keep the line moving. Wal-mart at most times is very busy. Sometimes people are just in a bad mood. Besides the few bad eggs, Wal-mart was a high quality job for the moment I was working there and would go back in a heart beat if it weren't for another streak of bad luck. Management was of the utmost quality work was the main focus but the customers may have suffered to some of the unhappiness and stress laid on employees due to undeserved lack of pay. I personally was not complaining a bit, I had previous experience with using a cash register so my pay grade was what I deserved it to be for a cashier but as an overnight employee, moving as much product as we did and still with an extra dollar an hour I was struggling to keep up. Receiving $10.25 nearly a dollar more than every other employee hired on night shifts and the work in my opinion was exhausting. I was also working another job at this point while taking part time classes at JJC but everybody there had the same amount of responsibilities, if not more, was about 20% faster than I, and getting paid a dollar less for night shift. I didn't fit in. I soon went back to cashier and got fired, deserving for call offs but deep down fired for the wrong reason. A pure accident.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Overnight Stocker ,"Lockport, IL",2/6/15,2015,2,6

Great enviornment and fun and friendly people to work with,I enjoyed Wal-Mart very much. They were very nice and the employees were great.

Inefficent yet friendly.,"Management is not the best and there is definite favoritism within the company. As for associates, all are friendly and help you when it is needed. It's extremely difficult to move up and scheduling of weekly hours are no stable at all. You must check your schedule almost on an everyday basis to schedule any other plans in your regular life. There's little resources given that allow you to do your job efficiently which is a large setback. Management will also schedule you on days you say you are not available on a regular basis which is extremely frustrating. Management also gives unrealistic time frames to complete tasks which also is very stressful and frustrating.",3,Current Employee,INVENTORY CONTROL SPECIALIST ,Porter Ranch CA,2/6/15,2015,2,6

Management always offered feedback and really helped me improve and achieve promotions.  My co-workers respected my decisions, fairness and honesty.  They really make a good team great.

There is never a boring or calm moment in my job and you have to be observant and on your toes at all times. Leading by example means having integrity which means doing the right thing even when no one is watching.

I learned how to use a hand gun, work the wake (a machine that goes up and down and drives like a car) and work pallet jacks. how to pick and bin merchandise and food products. a typical day at work is coming in at 10pm and having a overnight meeting then separating to either GM (GERNERL MERCHANDISE)  side or GROCERY side to start picking things out the system for the stockers to work. bring the picks out before 3 and go to break ..come back at 4am to start binning new freight and old ..everything must be off the floor by 7:00am before you go home. that's my typical day at Wal-Mart being a overnight IMS associate. like I said overall good place to work but just has a few tweaks to be fixed within the store.",3,Current Employee,Warehouse Employee ,"Starkville, MS",2/4/15,2015,2,4

"Good Pay, if you enjoy being treated a slave.","To be honest the pay was good. $10.95 hr after couple years working at Wal-mart. The problem is with management and their over dependence on their computer system. _x000D__x000D_There are some good managers but the average manager at wal-mart is some one who doesn't do any work at all. They have all the time in the world to use security cameras to spy on their own workers. When they changed inventory system to put products on certain shelves in the backroom so that we know through the computer system whether we had a certain item in stock and where it is. Some manager would go back there pull it out and then put it on another shelf. So if you had to help a customer find a product and you only had stuff in the backroom. You either turn the customer away or play a fun game where is the item really at. Which then you are wasting 10 to 20 min to find something while your being timed how fast your working stocking shelves. Since that happens the customer becomes the real loser because to keep our own jobs some people will just say its sold out._x000D__x000D_The next problem starts with the way they schedule, when I first started it was great you either works F,S,S,M or T,W,T,F and then the next three days off. Economy got worse so they changed it to two days off, ok no big deal, but it was consistent. Then they changed it where the computer system did the scheduling, now we're getting weird schedules that change constantly where you can end up working 10 days straight so long as there is two days off, somewhere.

Great company to work for.,"I worked for Wal-mart for 5 years. During my time with the company, I promoted from a part-time dry grocery associate to a Zone Merchandiser and again to an Assistant Manager. The pay was decent, though that was never a reason for me to promote. I liked my job, the job itself was great. I went from stocking shelves, to actually bringing products into the store, to setting up displays and actually making a difference in my store. This of course changed based on the management team above me. Training for management is horrible. I spent four weeks in a hotel to learn how to talk to people. The classes did little to brace you for the ""real world"" and taught you a lot about how to ""speak"" to protect the company image. Of course if you did not work prior for the company, you were shipped off with no actually knowledge about how a store works. This lead to a lot of issues within the store between managers that were not willing to learn due to their ""past experience"" to managers that would not train. The environment breeds a dog eat dog so to speak, you either learn to brown nose or you are an outcast because you do not fit in. The hardest part of the job was not the customers, as rude as they could be, or associates. The hardest part was dealing with other adults that talked about people behind their backs and later twisted converstations to fit their needs. The most enjoyable part was my associates. I worked with a great group of people that were willing and eager to serve their customers.

"Job itself is fine, management is an issue","Working for a large corporation such as WalMart is surely not going to be all easy and you'll no doubt get some issues with management, but my problem isn't what I expected. _x000D__x000D_A typical work day in my location usually starts off with a list of notes from one manager, that proceed to get entirely thrown out the window and contradicted by a second manager thirty minutes to an hour later. After your first direction change, a THIRD manager usually comes by with even different notes yet. Meanwhile, as you move on to your third completely different set of notes, the first two managers yell at you for not doing it their way despite the third one being higher up in levels of management. This is by far the hardest and most frustrating part of the job, and to make matters worse, the specific location I work at has managers who make messes then yell at Department Managers like myself to clean up said mess like we created it despite us having nothing to do with it. The worst part about the management, however, is they lie to your face consistently and try to claim there's an ""open door"" policy. This policy is garbage because if you go above the store manager, the outside levels tell you to walk the ladder, but the in-store management won't take the time to listen to your complaints so nothing ever gets resolved successfully within Walmart's ecosystem._x000D__x000D_The co-workers, however, are usually pretty good and the best part of the job.

Walmart is the worst company I have ever worked for.,"The first store I worked at was reduced to about half capacity a month after we opened, but the managers were at least willing to work with the remaining associates and understood that there simply wasn't any way to get everything done. We still worked harder than normal, but it was at least tolerable. The second store, however, was a hellish nightmare. My department bleed nearly all its workers in the span of a few months until there were two people to do the work of five. Management would routinely pull one of us to work different departments, but laughed in our faces when we requested help ourselves. Every suggestion made to management could be summed up as ""in one ear and out the other"". All of the upper management (who seemed to outnumber the actual floor associates by two-to-one) blindly followed whatever edict came down from the top, no matter how backwards or nonsensical it was. The only good thing I can say is that working there allowed me to learn multiple skills that I am eager to put to use at better companies.

I have nothing nice to say except that it is not anything like I would have expected.,"You have many bosses that tell you what to do. Including other employees that have only worked there a few more months than you,and they feel they can yell at you in front of customers to try to tell you how to do your job,like its rocket science...You have to ask to go to the bathroom,and then wait for someone to come stand in for you,and they never send anyone. You wait past time for your breaks and lunch if you get one for someone to come and stand in for you. Feel like I am in elementary school again,this is not a respectable position at all,and you don't get treated like a grown adult. Normal jobs you can just go to the restroom when needed,and not ask for permission and not get told you have to wait till we find someone to stand there in your place. Then wait another 25 to 40 minutes and they have forgotten or never find anyone that wants to stand there. You get sworn at by customers. Because they are irritated to have to show their receipt after they just went through the check out line. Which I don't blame them,I thought my job was just to say hi and welcome them to store then again when they leave tell them to come back soon. It's mostly about making sure the cashiers didn't miss ringing up any items customers bought,but customers think that the greeter is checking to see if they stole something. It's an awful job. I don't reccomend it to anyone. There is nothing enjoyable about it. I have asked to be put in different position in another department but no one wants the greeter job so I get told I have to wait till they can replace me,and its been over 3 weeks since - more...",2,Former Employee,PEOPLE GREETER ,"Killeen, TX",1/30/15,2015,1,30
Fun and Stressful,"Working at Walmart was a fun experience for the most part. Most days went good when my bags were stocked and the costumers were polite, but when you get the rude costumers then that is where the day went a little bad because I felt bad because I could not provide them with the services they wanted. Most of management was good there was a few that just wanted to prove themselves or disregarded the rules. The hardest part was working with messed up bags during a rush because it was really hard to even get the bags to open because they had been recycled so many times. I had fun with my co-workers they were all nice people and I really enjoyed that part. I ended up learning allot about how to work a cash register and how to improve my costumer service skills.

"Productive, fast paced, and exciting workplace with many customers coming and going.",Each day I go in I go to the back to see if any picks or freight is needing to be put out. Once that has been finished I retrieve the returns and assure they are put in their correct spots on the shelves. Zoning is necessary throughout the day so that customers are able to get the product they need without the hassle. I've learned just by asking someone how their day is going or how they are can make a big difference in their shopping experience. Interacting with the management at WalMart has taught me that not all of them share the same views about certain things. But I will say they assure the customers get great customer service and expect employees to follow the standards of procedures within the company. The hardest part of my job is trying to satisfy unruly customers. I do insure they get genuine customer service and equal treatment as all other customers.

When I was hired at Walmart I knew nothing about the business other than how to shop their. The position I started in was only for a short time. I quickly advance into a personnel position, to where my work seemed to have doubled. Not only was I in training for the training coordinator position but 2 months after that our personnel coordinator took a leave of absence and never came back. With no one there to replace her I quickly had to learn ALL  of her position as well as mine own. Learning how to juggle 16 hours of work in an 8 hour day was quite a challenge. It forced me to really use my time wisely, to always be pleasant even under enormous amounts of pressure and to work hard to ensure that i got the job done. The management team we had their was also a pleasure to work for.

Learning Experience,"I gained many of years of customer service and managerial experience.  After a while, there wasn't anymore room for growth with the company.

It was always a pleasure making sure customers left the establishment happy and willing to comeback.",3,Former Employee,Manager -Optical ,"Kearny, NJ",1/29/15,2015,1,29
Love the people I worked with,"Great chance for advancement, and to travel within Wal-Mart to help at other stores.

Average,Average place to work.  Decent salaries and work life balance if you are in the right job.  Not the same experience for everyone.,4,Current Employee,Senior Availability Manager ,Bentonville,1/29/15,2015,1,29
Hate it so much!!,Wal-Mart is probably one of the worst places to work at. I felt very under appreciated and they expected more from me everyday. One time I was sick with a fever of 101 and they still made me come in to work cause they said it was to late to call in!! Like dude I'm sick how is It to late to be sick!!! And then when a district manager comes to check out the store they make you do everything all at once. Like c'mon! If y'all made us do this stuff on a daily basis then y'all wouldn't have to scramble like this when the district manager comes. And the management there is terrible. They don't treat there associates like human beings more like robots. And the managers are so rude at times. I'm putting in my two weeks.,1,Current Employee,Meat Department Associate ,Huntsville tx,1/29/15,2015,1,29
"Walmart gets a bad rap, but this was a great experience","Upper management were all amazing! They truly cared about your work-life balance. Also, Operations Managers knew their business and majority lead by example. If you wanted to volunteer for secondary things, that was completely up to you. I was able to manage my team and focus on their success rather than jumping through hoops and playing corporate games. Volunteerism is encouraged and often planned on days you work so you aren't having to sacrifice your time off. Or, you know about events well in advance and can plan accordingly to be able to volunteer to great causes. In addition, giving back is a central theme as many items in the cafeteria are sold and the money goes to the Children's Miracle Network. Communication could be better, but while I was there they were working on improving that. The salary isn't as high as other similar positions I have had at other companies, however, I was expected to do less secondary projects/tasks, had a much better work-life balance, and the other parts of the benefit package were MUCH better than the other companies I've worked for in the past. The only thing I didn't enjoy was that I wasn't taken as seriously by my peers because I am a woman. The environment was essentially a ""boys club"" on a peer level as many of them worked their way up to Area Manager. I never felt that way from my Operations Manager or higher up, but it could be frustrating when dealing with a peer who doesn't listen to you because you ""don't know what you're talking about"" because you aren't a guy and/or you didn't start as an Orderfiller and live and breathe Walmart - more...",4,Former Employee,Area Manager ,"Sterling, IL",1/29/15,2015,1,29

Horrible Workplace,Everyday you walked into this place there was dramatic things going on. In a typical workday you might work in 6 different departments never getting a chance to finish any work. The managers were constantly telling you the opposite of what others mangers would tell you. The management was the worst here over any position I have ever held. There are times you might see a manager screaming in an associates face or just putting them down saying very inappropriate things. Most of your co-workers aren't too bad except that they will hire anyone. It's very difficult to work with people that can barely read or speak English. Also associates are constantly walking out on shift because of the managers of customers. I would say the hardest part of the job is getting thrown from department to department every day and getting yelled at for not being able to get an unreasonable amount of things accomplished. There wasn't anything enjoyable about this job. I found another position as soon as I could and left.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cockeysville, MD",1/28/15,2015,1,28

There are some hardworking people at Walmart, but then as with any job you have the slackers that you usually have to do their work also. The hardest part of the job is working an 8 hour day and still not being able to finish everything that is required. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.

Fun expriencing fast past job with great co workers,Work on cars from the time we open until we close. I learned how to better help customers and there needs as well how to work on cars. The management was alright until the switched our assistant managers and the new AM had no idea what he was in control of so that's the reason I left because of his power and to tell us what to do. Hardest part was the heat and possibilities of burning yourself from oil or the engines.

"Hard physical labor, but worth the benefits","On a typical day at work, I would literally run through out the whole shift trying to get my job completed because of the high overload of customers for the store as compared to staffing, it made things challenging on me.  I met my goals everyday, but I worked hard to get there.  I learned I could push myself physically to attain goals that I didn't know I could do.  I had a wonderful manager that would work with my crazy schedule (at the time) and was business-wise; we constantly made increase in sales while he was the manager and he was fair, and professional.  The next manager was all about production and went strictly by the schedule, she was biased to those that met her standards.  My co-workers were hard working individuals that could do miracles in production.  The hardest part of the job was baking the bread, it has certain specks that had we had to strictly go by for public health and safety, and yet you had to have your product ready for sale at a certain time.  I pushed myself to do this and it made it even harder when an employee wouldn't do their part and I had to take up the slack.  The most enjoyable part was at the end of the day when you look back and see what you have accomplished and say, ""did I do that?"" and hold your chin up and tell yourself, ""yes, I did.""",3,Former Employee,Bakery Clerk ,"Pensacola, FL",1/27/15,2015,1,27

Fine if you aren't management,"Instead of getting to the root of a problem (staffing, policy changes, innovations) management is blindly blamed - especially middle management.

Walmart Support Manager,"Walmart has completely lost touch with the core values that made made the company. The Work/Life balance is gone for most employees part time and full time primarily due to work schedules being done at the corp level. If you are a salaried manager expect to work in some cases as much as 16 hours a day. Compensation is low and benefits though offered to all full time employees is rendered almost useless by the low wage due to deductibles that require almost half your income per year. Job security and advancement come down to who you know and not how qualified or what you know. Management takes a complete hands off approach to work with few exceptions most I have dealt with have no ideal how to manage resources within the store they feel the are above doing the work themselves even if they are the only ones available to do it. The job culture is like many companies they over look anyone that is well qualified, set unattainable expectations then hold it against  employee preventing promotions while also creating a rift of discontent among the hourly management and employees.",2,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Baton Rouge, LA",1/27/15,2015,1,27

The best part of my job are the associates that I work with, they are like family to me. Also the customers that I help at Walmart. Most of them ask for me by name.

Management really doesn't care for the associates, they will spread you thin until you cant take it anymore (quit or fired). What I had learned from working with walmart was that I am thankful for the job but I will never work for them again because low pay and no benefits for part time workers and you will have to kiss major butt to move up. The hardest part about it was when you did nothing wrong you still get in trouble like a verbal warning or a written warning. The best part about my past job was the customers, knowing that my ""hello"" and my ""smile"" brighten their day because at times I was the only person they saw in a single shopping trip.",1,Former Employee,Lead Cashier ,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1/26/15,2015,1,26

"Great department managing, lacking in upper managment","On average the direct manager to your personal department is amazing.  They work with you to get you the most hours that is possible, but it is not always their choice and so no matter what your hours get cut because their manager needs to cut hours. The great managers include the managers up to ZMS,  The managers just above the ZMS get rotated often so they have an entire new set of procedures to learn so sometimes it makes it difficult for them to really have a handle on everything they need to know and how to best help the people that work in their area.  Towards the end of their season of managing that area, they are well versed and good at their jobs however there is always a great deal of favoritism.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Cake Decorator ,"Alamosa, CO",1/26/15,2015,1,26

Job summary,"Coming in after my weekend is over usually involves me being meet with a lot of underworked freight and product due to a worker shortage over the weekend. Not to mention, there are also employee shortages during my own work week as well. I've learned how to use certain tools and people I do have at my disposal to get the most necessary and relevant tasks completed in my work place, even though sometimes I'm unable to complete all my tasks. When ask about my productivity by management, I'm typically meet with little regard to me and my co-workers safety, health, as well as overall improvement of the warehouse. When me and my associates attempt to explain the reasoning behind any work discrepancies, even before being brought to our own attention, management tends to (blow-off) questions and answers by telling us to work harder, or that there is nothing they can do  to resolve these problems at all._x000D_My co-workers are good workers, but just have fallen in to much of a slump of discouragement, felling trapped by a corporation they fell underappreciates its employees.

I enjoyed most of the management team, and all of my co-workers.  We worked very well as a team.  The hardest part of the job though was the miscommunication between management and employees when it came to tasks.  By the middle of the day there would be so many tasks that were given out, plus you still had your routine that you are to do everyday and you would not have enough time or help to get them done.  They still expected you to get it all done and still held you accountable even though you do not have the help.

Working at Walmart.,"A typical day at Walmart was just UGH! You clock into work, and stand at a register. The cashiers rotate registers, so you aren't stuck to just one register. When someone would clock in, you would go to a different one. Everything you do at Walmart, you need your badge, and you only get one free replacement for that. At Walmart, they don't schedule anybody under 4 hours a day at work. If you worked for 8 hours or more, you got two 15 minute breaks, and one, one hour break. If it was less than 8 hours, you only got one 15 minute break, or two 15 minute breaks. Everything there was just confusing. _x000D_The management was not good to work with at all. There was only two managers that actually took care of the associates. With everybody else you were pretty much on your own. The managers treated everybody as if it was either sink or swim. As if you got hired and automatically knew what you were doing. Some of the coworkers were elderly people who have been there for years, they weren't so helpful. It was as if everybody had their little cliques. They were sorted out by age, position, and length of time working there. The hardest part of working there is not losing your head! I just wanted to rip out my hair!! The most enjoyable part was my paycheck. And going home.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Marion, IN",1/26/15,2015,1,26

3rd Shfit Warren Store,"I am currently working here and I have to say that it is all that the reviews said that it would be. The management has no structure and the overall direction that the store is headed is down. A typical day in this store would consist of clocking in, headed to the meeting which depending on the manager on the shift for the night could be anywhere from 10-30-minutes. The meetings usually consist of everything the upper management had to say about their morning walk. It usually is bad news because as 3rd shift you are the clean up crew and you never do anything right. So after we get essentially ""critiqued"" we are assigned out aisles. This is where you get to find out where you are going for the night.  Sometimes the unloaders have all the freight on the floor and sometimes they don't. This is just a  peek into the world of Wal mart world. Want to find out more, feel free to apply because we are always hiring because we are also firing!! We are told to cut our overtime and they change your schedules at the drop of a hat and don't tell you. You can get a no call no show for a day if you were scheduled to be off for when suddenly you're scheduled to work.   Your welcome!!",2,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Warren, MI",1/25/15,2015,1,25

Negative Work Environment,"You follow your set of tasks that you are given. The co-workers are pretty easy to work with. If you stick to yourself and complete your tasks on time and successfully, you should be OK. The management is terrible. They only look out for themselves and you cannot go to them with any questions or concerns for it will be to no avail. The hours and pay are nice, which lessens the effect of the cons of working there. The are pretty flexible with the scheduling if you are a promising worker or if they like you. They give you two 15-minute breaks and a one hour lunch. On the night shift there no more than two assistant mangers there on any given night. Which is good, so that you are not given two conflicting tasks to do. On most nights, everyone works together to get all of the work finished. The most enjoyable part was being able to do your job without getting bothered constantly. The hardest part was to keep up with the times when they weren't always correct since management were 'positive' there was no mistake in the timing you were given. You could have three pallets of freight to work and you could be given thirty minutes to complete it. On average, depending on what department you are in, a pallet could take anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour if you were a decent worker. I learned that, in the end, teamwork is what matters on a job like this. All of the workers need to have great communication and put in an effort to have the best teamwork. That is the most sure way of getting the job done and accurately.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Sweetwater, Texas",1/25/15,2015,1,25

Terrible work environment,"My typical day at work would be to find out which department I would be working in that day. I was job coded in 6 different departments as a sales associate. I would be given a task then once that is done I would go help someone else complete their task or I would be assigned to complete someone else task. I learned how to complete inventory, claims items, complete returns and exchanges, cash checks through Walmart system, how to work a Gemini, how to freshly pick produce, how to do price changes and how to do simple functions on the cash register. Management was very poor. They are not understanding and they take advantage of you behind your back. They cut your hours without notifying you and they may have you work 7 days a week before receiving an off day. My co-workers have never been an issue.

I had one day of training but my second day I was on my own and of course I got overwhelmed with truck drivers coming in back to back and trying to take advantage of the newbie saying they were on tight schedules; could they go ahead of drivers that were there first, drivers that had larger load; trying to put their stock up before I could count them. For a split second I thought about quitting then I don't know what came over me but I told all of these drivers, ""Like Ray Lewis this is my house and I will do what it takes to run it so sign in and have a seat, I saw the order you came in and that is the order I will call you in, if you have somewhere else to be you may leave but keep in mind company policy says I close and lock the bay doors at 11 sharp.""

"I would not recommend working for wal-mart to anyone, at least not in maintenance.","Typically night maintenance would do nearly nothing, leaving much for the day maintenance such as myself to pick up the slack to no commendation nor recognition of such. I would immediately start in on cleaning the bathrooms that typically would be untreated by the time I would usually come on, either at noon or afternoon, or I would make at least one cardboard bale that was almost always overfull, then I would do a safety sweep of the entire building, touch up on the bathrooms before lunch, tackle the bathrooms again after lunch, collect and compact all the trash in the building, make a bale, and do a safety sweep before leaving. One thing I liked about wal-mart was that I was always busy, and the hours were good too, but only if you had hours. I learned how to make bales, and zone, and make stuff, but I learned more that not only honest hard work isn't enough to get by in life, but it almost certainly doesn't help you at all. If it did I wouldn't be writing this, but I was the best maintenance worker they had and they kept the guy that put more effort into hiding than into working, simply because he had been there 2 months more than me, he was a regular associate and I was still a temp, and after the holidays they let all the temps go. Not all management there was a joke, but I spoke to THE store manager about this when nothing was being done about it by the CSS' s, and not only nothing happened, but then 2 days later I was let go, and I know it said ""without reasonable accommodation"" or whatever, but when you're my overseeing manager and I'm asking you why I have 0 hours - more...",2,Former Employee,Maintenance Worker ,"Anderson, CA",1/23/15,2015,1,23

(However I think this applies at any job, just more so at Walmart.) As soon as you cross the thresh hold of the door your problems need to disappear. The world no longer revolves around you, but on the customers you are there to serve. The co-workers are incredibly fun and up-eat and easy to get along with. They are very welcoming when first starting out. I never ha any problems with my co-workers. I think the hardest part of the job was being on my feet for so long at such a constant rate. Make sure you get VERY comfy shoes! Or your back and feet will not last. (And this is coming from a young person.) The best part of job was being able to cheer a flustered customer up.

I learned a lot about food service as well as many other departments at this company. Management was able to take some of the problems occurred around certain times of the year and was able to find solutions to them quite quickly.

A typical day for me consisted of taking care of the video game aisle and it was a job I enjoyed because I got to talk video games which is a hobby of mine I enjoy.

My skills in this area are good but I believe there is always room for improvement in anything you do.,3,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Baltimore,Maryland",1/23/15,2015,1,23
"Great place, but can be stressful and lack of empathy from management.","I worked at Wal-Mart for a couple of years. It was a great place who worked with my schedule and paid me decently well for the area I live in. I learned many things when it came to customer service and business needs, along with knowledge about many different subjects. I worked in sporting goods at Walmart. Honestly if you are in any other department from what I saw while I was there and what I heard from many other people, other departments were completely different. My department was not a cake walk, but the other managers for the other departments were so needy. It did not matter how many customers needed help or how few people were in your department, if you did not complete your task for the day or week, or do what your manager told you to do, then they would either chew you out, keep hounding you to get it done asap, or the would write you up for it. My department was manager-less. I was the acting department manager. That means I did what a manager did just did not get the pay a manager got. My manager was on leave for a pregnancy so I understood and was ready to have some extra responsibility so in the future I could become an official department manager. The reason I gave the company a 4 star review and gave management a one star is for this reason. They let me go because a manager did not like that I told ""the person who fired me"", I won't say if guy or girl, how to sell a gun. Again I was in sporting goods. Firearms ( aka guns ) and knives and camping and outdoor stuff was what I knew about. I had the knowledge about anything anyone needed to know. I loved that department. - more...",4,Former Employee,Sporting Goods Department manager ,"Martinsville, VA",1/23/15,2015,1,23
counter productive and sloppily managed,"Walmart is hard to describe. The facility i was employed at seemed to not have their priorities in order. The hiring process was flawed, i was hired for one job and was preforming duties completely unrelated to the original job description. Promotions and job advancement practically do not exist at that facility. When inquiring about another job in the same facility it is likely you'll be told the position is open and then suddenly you'll see some new faces around the facility. Customers usually managed the facility, Managers left early leaving front end associates outnumbered with a plethora of customers and problems. Scheduling was flawed and unpredictable. Employees were usually scheduled days back to back leaving them with only one day off before the next pay period began. Overall score is a 2 out of 5. Walmart is strictly a last resort in employment.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Front End Associate ,"Hagerstown, MD",1/23/15,2015,1,23

From 3pm to 6 or 7 pm I would work then go to lunch for half an hour to an hour, we are aloud a whole hour lunch. I learned the basics of working with food and I honestly found dish washing most enjoyable. It was one of the most peaceful parts of the job to me. I think the hardest part of the job was adapting for the first 2 weeks before I got the hang of things. For a while I worked 6-7am to 3-4pm. After a couple weeks i worked nights, 3pm-11pm and it took me 5 months or so to get it to 3pm-12am.

Walmart is a pretty good place to work temporarily, but if your looking to transfer, it would actually be easier just to find another job. And it's pretty hard to move up in this store to.

I learned several different departments how to be flexible with my bosses and how to be a great team player to the other employees.

Distribution center pay was great but well being of employees lack within the company!!,"I worked in the distribution center loading trailers, not the position I wanted but was told I can transfer after 6 months and the only way to get in with the company was taking their ""entry"" level position loading trailers and 1 1/2 year later NO transfer granted. I even had a knee injury and would had been more beneficial for all to place me in a position I'm more capable of doing. The knee injury took place while working in the shipping docks loading trailers and it was actually my knee kissing the dock plate; so to speak. I had to go through physical therapy and even hired an attorney due to the fact that I had to fight to get any medical attention. The only thing ever granted to me was physical therapy. Multiple MRI requests got denied, roughly 5 requests total. Wal-mart wanted to place me in a store making $10 less on the hour due to the restrictions from my leg injury but there are plenty of positions within the warehouse one with restrictions such as myself can comfortably manage. Once my physical therapy was completed and I was clear to return to work (without restrictions) the workers compensation claim was settled and just 3 weeks after this settlement I was terminated! It was determined by the state after multiple appeals and a court hearings that termination was ""without just cause in connection with work""!

I learned that if you have focus to detail and organization that people WILL notice. The management was friendly most of the time but was very busy so if you wanted to talk to them it was best to do it before or after your shift. The most challenging part was getting used to being on my feet a lot but I  got used to it. The best part about working the night shift is that there isn't as much going on and there are less demands and room to work without getting in the way of customers.

"Great opportunity to lead, develop, engage and create positive culture.","Walmart is a challenging , fun , fast paced, non-typical work environment that cover many operational task. I learned how to multi task, lead, engage, coach, plan, transitioning and execute through tenacious follow up and action planning. Executive management tend to over strategize rather than focus on the basics of merchandising, processes, in stock and operations, sometimes infringes  on the integrity of the mission statement. Co-workers were engaged with completing basic processes, but frustrated with last minute go do's, phantom surveys and canceled visits.

"Third shift workers are always told that we are ""adifferent breed"".  That much is true.  You become somewhat of a family","I prefer to stay busy.  So everyday was a busy day for me.  There is always something to be done. You  learn something as often as you can.  I was constantly learning, policies, procedures, and most of all people and customers.  Of course every manager varies in how they choose to run the store when under their command.  Being best of friends with your manager is not necessary to work efficiently.   Having a level of respect on both ends employer/employee always helps for a more successful outcome.  Working as a team is just as important as being able to work individually. Knowing your own personal strengths can help you plan for success. Having this information available about your other team members can  be very helpful as well.

Tough customers but rewarding in various little ways,A typical day at work consists of maybe at most five angry/unhappy customers complaining or making the job a little harder than it should be. I learned how to be patient with the various age groups of customers I handled. My coworkers were very supportive when I got a tough customer that just couldn't be pleased. The hardest part of this job was maintaining a smile and being very outwardly since I am somewhat of an introvert. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to be part of the reason why a customer came back smiling and wanting to buy our products that I informed them about during a previous visit.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Los Lunas, NM",1/18/15,2015,1,18

Checking out our customers was our priority assignment at all times. Aft er ten years I could help a customer find almost anything in the store except clothing brands. The management team was awesome for the most part. Their were a few that made you wonder how they made it. The majority of my co-workers were very dependable and hardworking individuals who would help each other. Of course there are always a few who are there for a paycheck rather than to do a good job. Completing all the tasks expected of us when we were shorthanded was the hardest part and my favorite was taking care of the customers.

And then I follow up threw oout the night to see if anyone needs help and how they are really doing. I try not to give any associate any more work then I feel they can handle. I try listening to what all of my co-workers have to say then if I feel that it is something that I can't handle then I follow up with upper management. The hardest part of my job is making sure everything is done on time, and that I get all of the associates out on a timely manner.

Was an eye opener,"I thought working at Walmart would have been miserable but it was quite enjoyable. I started off as a cart pusher and very quickly moved to the produce dept. Here I worked assisting customers, replenished and rotated stock, and general quality and inventory control. Later I was in charged of unloading the morning truck and maintaining our back stock. I learned many things about our product and used that knowledge to better assist customers. management was lacking. The assistant manager who was over our dept. rarely interacted with me and my co-workers. My yearly review was given to me over the phone due to him forgetting and despite all my hard work chose not to give me all high marks because he said he needed to have some area for me to improve. Co-workers were great and worked hard as a team maintaining the freshness of the product in our dept. which was number one in the district.

first job,"worked at the general merchandise side of Walmart. unloading the trucks and placing the product on pallets for the right product to go to the right department.at the tail end of the day i would help stock shelfs of product. what i learned is to work as a team, getting stuff done in a timely manner,learned how to face product.

I had good co-workers and not so good co-workers.the most enjoyable part was the 10 % off card we got.",1,Former Employee,GM Unloader ,"Eugene, OR",1/15/15,2015,1,15
Retail position,When I first started for Wal-Mart everyone warned me about how poorly they treated their employees and I disregarded it. For the first 6 months or so I felt comfortable in my position and I did not understand what the stigma was. After the company started advancing/promoting me and giving me more duties I quickly saw how the dynamics changed as employees moved higher up on the occupational ladder.,3,Former Employee,Customer services rep./Back up supervisor ,"Juneau, AK",1/15/15,2015,1,15
productive workplace,Its a good job to have. My customer service skills are improving everyday.

Working for Walmart,Since I am able to do almost anything in the store I never know where the managers are going to put me. I currently am a cashier. I also work the money center and customer service where i do returns. I have been working at walmart for 6 years. I have learned to just go with the flow. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part is when a something is changed and management doesnt let you know.

Productive day at the workplace.,"A typical day at Walmart moves on a well paced schedule. I learned when its not busy to clean my area around me and put away all returns. The managers are a big help, especially when it comes to a price check or a problem with a customer they are always there to help. My co-workers as well are helpful. Whenever your lost or have a problem sometimes a co-worker can help out therefore you don't have to call a manager. The hardest part about the job is that all cashiers have to be prepared to get backed up at times when its busy. You have to make sure you have bags, receipt paper, and anything else you might need. The most enjoyable part about the job is that when we're backed up (busy) we get customers in and out in a timely manner and time actually fly's when we're busy.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Landover Hills, MD",1/15/15,2015,1,15

Walmart Pharmacy is Differcult but Rewarding.,A typical day at the Walmart Pharmacy consists of helping the customers with their prescriptions and OTC items.  Along with helping customers the completed prescriptions need to be filed accordinally in alphabetical order.  Prescriptions held over ten days are returned to stock.  New medications are stocked in bays with older meds in front and newer in back.  Areas are always kept clean and orderly.  The hard part of the job is learning how to multi-task and make sure the customers and the number one priority.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer is satisfied and appreciative of the service.   The supervisors are helpful and understanding;  the co-workers are very busy but still tooned into the needs of others working along side.,4,Former Employee,Pharmacy Cashier/Clerk ,"Stafford, VA",1/15/15,2015,1,15

"It's not an ideal job, but it's a job.","Wal-mart is not the worst job you can have. If you make full time (which is hard to do in some cases) you have good benefits. Even if you are part time you get benefits after 1 year. My main problems with Wal-Mart are 1.) their point system, 2.) management. _x000D_1.) point system: Wal-Mart's point system is hard to work with. You can only have three points in a six month period before you start getting write-ups, and only 3 write-ups before you are fired. Even if you leave to go to the emergency room and bring back a doctor's note you are pointed. So basically, if you are sick often, you will probably be fired for attendance. _x000D_2.) Management-management in my experience is easy to talk to and they are good at working with customers. However, wal-mart's organization leaves much to be desired, and because of this it is hard to get management to approve days off for things such as medical reasons. The schedules are also constantly getting mixed up, and different members of management will tell you different things to do.",4,Current Employee,"Deli Associate-prepare food, follow state ","Fayetteville, AR",1/15/15,2015,1,15

Management is incompetent and horrible, advancement is not likely, and even if you are qualified they will give it to one of their friends. Pay is absolutely horrific. Even though I had 4 years of experience and am bilingual in Spanish, they started my pay off as the same rate they gave a young kid fresh out of high school with no work experience. Management does not listen to your concerns, and often times I was not given the resources I needed to do my job well.

"Hard work with little reward, no help from management, constant fear of job loss","Walmart expects more from associates than they deliver in return.  Part time associates are expected to be available any time but only as Walmart needs.  Associates are expected to be available 40+ hours over the holidays, including full shifts on those holidays, but after Christmas, hours are cut in half.  You constantly work nights and weekends, regularly work at least a week straight with no days off, and when you do have days off, they're never together.  Management will put you down if you ask for a steadier schedule.  They can't understand why anyone would want a life outside Walmart!  Important rules and procedures are never seen in writing but expect to be reprimanded or ""coached"" for not following those.  Also expect them to change on a whim.  Most coworkers are fine since you're all in the same boat, but some feel the need to backstab to get ahead.  The best part are the customers, even the bad ones, because you can always learn something from that experience.  The worst part of the job is management and the ever-changing rules.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Greenville, SC",1/14/15,2015,1,14

As far as co-workers they are wonderful to work with and became future friends. The hardest part of the job would mostly be unable to get off work on time when employees are not able to work past a certain time. Some jobs have some policies that only allow to miss 3 days within a 6 month period. I honestly struggled with this because I had help when my mom lived with me. She would watched my kids when I worked. It wasn't until 2013 that she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and I had to help her and kids plus work. After she passed there were time I was late for work and days I missed because of either kids getting sick or my health/ injuries. Recently, that is why I decided I needed to quit back in September 2014 to help my kids at home for a while.

You are required to work 50 hours a week and they will watch you like a hawk if you even show up late or leave early so you have no time at home.

Not a good work environment; Highly unorganized,"It started off rather similar to the job I had at Food Lion. We would stock the shelves regularly and help customers find items. Later on, after many people were being fired, we ended up being understaffed. This led to me almost being the sole person on the second shift, with the daily responsibility of unloading the grocery truck by myself (which is a 3-4 man job). It seemed as if the majority of management was worried about receiving a big bonus check at the end of the year, cutting expenses anywhere they could. It ended up being a hard job, which I don't mind hard work, but I at least expect an according amount of associates available to properly complete a job task. The one thing that I did like was the fact that every day when I came in at the same time I knew what my job was and what I needed to get done.

What I thought about management is they were nice but at the same time they wouldn't let you advance they wanted to hold you back and not let you go forward in the company. The co-workers were fun to be around they were funny, nice, and all around helpful when I needed help or needed to learn something new. The hardest part of the job was moving some of the 7500 pound pallets with a broken pallet jack because they wouldn't buy new equipment.

High productive work w/ high expectation toward company,"There would always be something different every day coming to the back room on what needs to be worked what needs to be put for storage. Every day is a challenge to doing your job like for example, squeezing your way through tight spots to get to a bin or carefully taking merchandises out of bins without knocking the other stacked merchandises down like a game of Jenga. Through those tough times the enjoyable parts were that there would be a little music that every co-worker in the back would agree to listen to. Speaking of co-workers they're not that bad to worker with at all just get to know there type of attitude is all, and that also goes towards management as well. From my times there what I learned from Walmart is there are good times and struggles, but with hard effort comes knowledgeable reward for not just with work, but out of work.",4,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Tracy, CA",1/13/15,2015,1,13
Fun workplace,"I worked in the auto dept. doing basic stuff oil changes, tire work, battery work... etc. I got the chance to work with some very open minded, fun guys, who were always jumping at the chance to learn something new and find ways to bring in more customers for the whole store. The hardest part of the job was that during my time there the turn over rate was and as i know currently still is very high. Mostly because benefits aren't offered unless full time and they make sure that only supervisors or management are the ones who can receive full time. I did apply for a full time job was full time for 3 wks and then got bumped to part time hrs much like others within my store. I felt like in a sense that company is neglecting their workers that are willing to put in the time and that may need the benefits by making sure that those workers can't receive any. _x000D_Most enjoyable part was that I got to learn more about cars, than I actually knew previous to working there, and the people I worked with and customers I met were really awesome people.",2,Former Employee,Service Technician ,"Broomfield, CO",1/13/15,2015,1,13

"Night shift, grocery stocking","Wal-Mart is an excellent company to work for providing you want to make a 35 to 40 year career at retail 'warehouse' sales with a tract to be promoted from the inside.  But, part time work is not what it could be given the employee culture I experienced on the graveyard.  Management was awesome...but I could not overcome the 20 year age gap with me being the senior in age given the average age of the stocking employees.

I enjoyed working,"Depending on when my shift started would determine how busy it was there. Usually mornings were slow while around 11 things would pick up. Management was always helpful though getting change requests would take hours if you don't seek out a csm yourself. The change requests were the only thing stressful about work because it would slow things down and customers for some reason believed the registers had an endless supply of money, then when change does come it's not what you needed and you have to wait a bit longer. But other than that I enjoyed my co-workers. They were very nice and if you didn't know how to do something they would come in help when they aren't busy. But nothing beat the feeling of accomplishment when you're able to quickly get people through your line.

Wal-Mart is a giant retail company and each day we helped over 1000 customers of different race, personalities, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to help my customers walk away happy and satisfied.

"it all depends on the individual, and if you fit in.","When you sign in the kiosk, the computer tells you where you will be working, or what register you will be working with; then do your job.

Each store is different,"The hardest part of being a long term Wal-Mart associate is the changes that have been made that have gone against what Mr. Sam would have liked.  Most store do not have enough associates to have the store run smoothly with costumer service, and getting tasks done at the same time.  The store manager I am under right now gives out tasks that take most of the day and doesn't leave time for the Department Managers to get their regular work done, and he doesn't understand why price changes or mods go late.  The hourly associates that stay in their jobs are the best in the business.  We work together as a team and support each other.  The hardest part of the job is getting 12 hours worth of work done in 8 hours, by yourself.  When left to do the work I know needs to get done, and being able to help others accomplish what they need to get done makes me feel like I have accomplished something that day, even if I didn't get everything I wanted to done.",4,Current Employee,Hourly Supervisor ,"Layton, UT",1/10/15,2015,1,10

Walmart isn't all that great.,"As a cashier I normally complete cash, check, and debit transation with customers. I look up prices if I neeeded to. Sign cutomers up for credicards. I also worked in the customer service area and completed returns or exchanges. Working here was definatly a challenge. The Walmart I worked at was very ghetto and unprofessional. Employees would get promotions not based on the most qualified but who did you know or rubbed elbows with. they took away benifits for employees that work part time. Managers are not sympathetic and make you feel that you are not important. The hardest part is when there isn't enough employee on the registers and you are the only one. The most enjooyable is makeing new friends with the emplyees around the store. Other than that, you work like a slave here.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Lancaster, CA",1/9/15,2015,1,9

No Thanks,"It was pretty much retail like any other, but Wal-Mart really felt like the definition of a soulless corporation.  I'm honest and old enough to know better than to sugar coat a company that's more willing to write a mother up for having to leave work early than to let her go take her child to the emergency room.  I've seen it happen, and it was just sad._x000D__x000D_I've had plenty of customers tell me that I was extremely helpful, or cashiers telling me in the break room that someone was speaking highly of me, so I know I was doing well at the part of the job that mattered most._x000D__x000D_I also had the opportunity to work with some interesting people, such as the guy who was arrested in front of everyone for having stolen more than $20,000 from the safe and another who felt that whistling at me like a dog then pointing at something was the way to tell me he wanted something moved._x000D__x000D_I suppose you could say it was an interesting experience.",1,Former Employee,Merchandiser/Sales Associate ,"Florence, KY",1/9/15,2015,1,9

A culture anchored by strong principles and driven by diversity.,"EVERYONE at Walmart is an entrepreneur.  Everyone is a Sam Walton to the degree that they can or want to be.  If you walk through Walmart Home Office on any given evening, Saturday, Sunday, you will see salaried member of staff putting in extra hours.  They are doing it to help a customer, to bring a project in ahead of time, or to test out some new idea.  Not because they have to, but because they view service to the customer and striving for excellence as entrepreneurial license.  Walmart employees are called “associates” because they are true business partners.  That partnership is what allows a company the size of Walmart to operate as well as it does._x000D__x000D_The culture is constantly nourished by good leaders who put in the extra time to get to know everyone on some personal level.  I once said that time spent at Walmart as an associate at any level is an incredible education.  You not only have access to leaders at every level, but they have access to you and take a genuine interest in your career.  They are interested in associates' ideas and in putting in the extra time to listen, and give practical feedback.  In fact, most leaders took the same view that I did:  If the associates around me weren’t presenting ideas, discussing, and arguing their cause, then I wasn’t getting my money’s worth.   I had more than a quarrel or two during my time there. Never about the goal; just about how to attain it, and I came away a better associate, regardless of the outcome._x000D__x000D_Most of the time at Walmart you are so immersed in the culture that you fail to appreciate it the way you should. - more...",5,Former Employee,Manager of Optical and Medical Billing ,"Bentonville, AR",1/9/15,2015,1,9
