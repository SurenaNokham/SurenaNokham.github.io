Unfair understaffed workplace,"I am not sure if it was just the location i worked at or the whole Company. I honestly wouldn't recommend anyone to work for Walmart. I had so many problems as a department manager trying to get the overnight team to cooperate with me. The Pharmacists had to call meetings with the store managers to try and get them to get everyone on the same page but there would never be any follow up. I got fed up and requested to work behind the counter as a Pharmacy Tech, but that turned out to be an even worse situation. I was never allowed time to train so i was clueless everyday trying to help patients get their prescriptions which can be very frustrating for patients that are in pain or just don't have time.",1,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"O'Fallon, IL",5/4/18,2018,5,4

Good pay for a retail job but poor work environment,The job was not difficult and should not have been stressful but management did not treat employees as they should.

Hectic and unfriendly environment,"Very stressful and many co workers are unorganized. I learned that wal mart is one of the worst companies in america to work for.

Average-paced workplace with slight favoritism,"I only worked at Walmart for four months as a temp but it was clear that most managers have their own way of doing things. There is a slight communication issue among associates that nobody seems to notice or care about. The pay at Walmart was good; I was able to start my adult life with a steady income. I worked second shift (2pm-11pm) for the entirety of the remodel which I didn’t mind. Overall, Walmart is a 3/5 workplace.",3,Former Employee,Remodel Associate ,"Forest City, NC",5/4/18,2018,5,4
work place is fun,Walmart gives you enough  help to perform your task daily.

Hated my job when I worked here.,"The one 3rd shift manager at the time was terrible and didn’t know what she was doing. Very bossy, but never helped anyone with problems they were having.

productive and keeps you busy,"A day at work is depending on how many trucks we get, how many break packs we get. what we can get done by the time we go home. i've learned a lot from this company by using a pallet jack and just by getting more experience from the company. the work place keeps you on your feet and keeps you busy with the task you have or helping a customer.

fast paced work environment,"Daily tasks were explained at the beginning of the shift to be completed by the days end. Upbeat energy and communication with fellow department heads to help complete the tasks often took place. Follow up meetings with management often took place throughout the day to ensure departments were on track, and if not a game plan should be in place. A well versed array of cultures and ethnicities were on various levels of staffing. The challenges of the day consisted of possibly not completing the tasks and delegating the game plan the others to finish.

"It was a stressful, fast pace job.","A typical day at Walmart was understaffed and grumpy co-works.

The most enjoyable part of working here was some of the friendly customers. My manager was extremely nice but others were extremely rude.",3,Former Employee,Deli Clerk ,"Chino, CA",5/4/18,2018,5,4

Co-workers were great!!!,"I enjoyed the people I worked with the most. As far as the way the company, the store is ran I can't speak too highly of it. The human resource department needs some work, it's hard to get people to stick around. Most of the management was nice to work with but just chaotic. They didn't have enough people for certain jobs so they pull you out of your department to go somewhere else a lot. I didn't mind helping out other departments at all, that seemed to be fine sometimes but they take others from the department too, it happened a lot, then you don't get stuff done in your department either. Plus if you wanted to be in another position you would have applied for that position. Oh and not too mention all that computer stuff you have to do...I think some of the training is way overkill and just no necessary at all, plus redundant, you get pestered to do it and it takes time out of real work and then you don't get anything in return. Plus having to finish all of your computer training before you got a raise was beyond me that was stupid too because you get so busy on the job to think about going back to do the training.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Holland, MI",5/4/18,2018,5,4

WOW and Crazy,"My brief time with Walmart was interesting.  I had a great opportunity to meet some really great people. It was an honor to work among some of the most humble people I ever met outside of church. I met people who went above the call of duty to ensure that customers, in particularly the elders and the handicap, received noteworthy service.  It was a privilege and an honor to service people who was kindhearted and valued the service received. However, for the most part, there were those who resemble in appearance and behavior as those capture on YouTube.  There was a lot of hardship.  I saw battered children, abused women and I met with a great deal of prejudice.  I had complaints made against me for ""holding a cellphone"" while I was trying to read a coupon, money was tossed on the counter so that I could not touch the person and not placed in my hand, my character was judge based on my employment with Walmart and not by the level of my intelligent displayed.  Walmart is to commended for the opportunities and resources they make available to the community and their employees. But when an irate customers makes threats against an employee who is following the rules of the company to cause them bodily harm and endangerment and the company is not supportive to the employee, something is wrong.

Walmart Review,"A typical day at Walmart can be a very stressful one. Products have to get off the truck, down the line, sorted, pulled to the sales floor and sometimes stocked by the backroom associates who have to prepare for the next truck before unloading and after unloading merchandise trucks. All of whom will usually have large volumes of merchandise. As a back room associate, I had a lot of responsibilities and at times it was overwhelming. This was not a good job to start out. I did however, learn a few things. Management at Walmart was split and not always organized. One manager could be telling our team to do one task and how to do it. A different will give the same task with different specifications that will conflict with the first manager's. I learned that you have to tell the second, third and even forth manager each task given to cover yourself otherwise you can face being reprimanded. I also learned to identify the quality of management and how to respond to different qualities of management. When a good manager moves to a different store or leaves the company and is replaced by another manager to 'increase efficiency' it is wise to consider moving to a different store or seeking employment elsewhere. Walmart has a very high turn-over rate. The pay is good but I would not expect to keep the job for very long. Expect for your managers to be looking for a reason to let you go the moment you are hired.",1,Former Employee,Truck Unloader/Stocker ,"Lake City, SC",5/4/18,2018,5,4

meh,I didn't mind working for the company but they had poor management and were not good at keeping up with employees and paperwork.

Overall disappointing,"A typical day of work would normally start at 5PM and go to 10PM most weekdays and some weekends.  I worked through one of the coldest winters retrieving carts to the entrance and keeping the walkway free of ice, snow, and debris.  It was a tough job that did not pay well and the hours were brutal especially since i worked during high school. The managers were tough but good at their jobs and divided work fairly evenly between employees.  The hardest part of the job was being able to push through several inches of snow and ice and windchills commonly below freezing/0 during the winters and high heat during the summers.

Sucks,If you work at walmart now run while you can. Start somewhere else while you are still young!! Walmart will do anything at store level to make management look good!

Not Terrible,"Working at Walmart is not actually as bad as you'd think. As a sales associate, you start out at a retail entry level. You spend a lot of time stocking items and keeping your department clean. Everything is really laid out for you and you get daily tasks assigned to you. It does not allow for a lot of room to make your own decisions, but you do get an hour long lunch and of course, you can take breaks as needed. Your schedule will not be a normal 9-5, and you can expect to work 7 days in a row. Also, you'll work holidays and it's required you come in on Black Friday, no matter what. I don't miss retail one bit! But Walmart was just like any other retail employer. The only big difference is that the turnover rate is extremely high and you'll be working very hard, probably going above and beyond your job description every day.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Chattanooga, TN",5/3/18,2018,5,3

It could be a great place to work,"In my experience, a lot of games are played by management.  Threats are made that if you don't do ""this"", then you will lose your hours.

Eh,"Well lets be real, retail is retail. There's a lot of days where you consider throwing your name badge at management and quitting, not even gonna lie about that one and some days you might even want to punch a customer.

Walmart was a good temporary job,"My job was mostly fast passed and sometimes stressful due to working with unhappy customers, but I learned how to keep cool when someone is yelling. The management was good, but not very personable. Walmart feeds employees well for lunches when requiring working holidays, which made it a little less hard to take. The hours were the hardest part of the job, even when there was a schedule agreed on there were still many schedule deviations that made going to school very hard.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service/Front End Cashier ,"Cedar City, UT",5/2/18,2018,5,2
My time as a Walmart employee,"A typical day would be getting clocked in and seeing what things the supervisors would need us to do. We would then gather around 7-8am to go over today's announcements and do our store cheer._x000D_After that I would begin to sort things from carts that contained things from my department that were found in another department. Since I worked in Snack and Drink department I would put stuff like candy and chips away then I would 'Zone' an area, basically make it look nice and fill the spot on the shelves. I would do this basically all day. At times I would help costumers find things or grab another pallet of water from the back room to fill a depleted one. During holidays I would help set up displays of candy and other stuff in the holiday section. If I didn't have anything on my list to do I would help people from other departments sort and organize everything as well. _x000D_Eventually I transferred to the back room and for that job I just counted everything, made sure it had the correct markings and sorted everything to make room so the system knew exactly how much merchandise was in the back room and what we would need to order. _x000D_I learned how to keep things clean and organized according to company standards, smile at everyone and be willing to help them at a moment's notice._x000D_The management was alright and really did their best to make everyone feel included and up-to-date._x000D_Work place culture was a little depressing.

Best suited for those seeking part-time employment.,"Walmart is a job most suitable for those looking for part-time employment.  Although the pay would be considered good for this type of work, it is not enough -- especially since hours per week are often uncertain -- to sustain a decent lifestyle as an adult.

Stressful place to work,"I was in management most of my career with Walmart. I worked in different stores and each store had a different atmosphere.

Walmart used to be a good company to work for,"I would never recommend this company to any one to work at. The company has gone down since Sam Walton passed and the share holders took it over. They treat the hard working associates as if slavery had never gone away. The slackers are treated like royalty and the managers are severely under trained and useless. When you give 100%, management expects 10 times that out of you just to pick up the slack of the people they don't want to deal with. I was once told that the company hires 10% of people to do nothing and you are expected to pick up the slack. I was hurt on the job back in 2016 and as I was financially taken care of, the mangers looked at me in disgust and rarely asked how I was doing. When my wife had our first child, I had just been promoted to Department Manager of furniture and took my 2 week leave and when I came back, I was coached because the department had fallen apart. That had happened again a few years later when my second child was born. The managers are there to work you to death and not care about anything you have to say.

"So-so work environment, but poor management","While the work environment of Walmart (the jobs needed to be performed, the co-workers, the customers, etc.) is alright enough to be enjoyable at times, the same cannot be said about the management. Granted, not all managers and/or supervisors will fall into this description, but more than enough of them do, enough to give off a strong, negative vibe for how the company as a whole views and treats its employees. Based on my experiences, both as a direct employee and as a third-party worker (under Way To Go Merchandising), Walmart's management tends to be very cold and uncaring towards its employees, treating them as an easily replaceable workforce._x000D__x000D_Example: When I was staying at a homeless shelter, who closed their doors at 10 PM and I was working a 3 to midnight shift, I tried to stay in the break room of the Walmart I was working at (during winter, no less) until the shelter re-opened its doors at 5:30 AM. While waiting and trying to get some sleep (after working a full 8 hour shift), I was approached by a couple of Walmart managers who berated me for staying in the break room after my shift was done, and made it quite clear that I was no longer allowed to do so from that point onward, despite being homeless and it being the middle of winter.",3,Former Employee,Stockman ,"Ashland, WI",5/1/18,2018,5,1

Walmart,"It was always busy. The thing that was disliked by all employees was they fact that they were constantly changing policies and didn't keep you up to date on all the changes per department Then they would essentially get you in trouble for not following that policy, but you never were informed of all of the changes.  If you have to leave for an emergency it counts against you and you receive points towards days off, because you're only allowed to miss so many days.  For everyday you miss you get points. Also, if you are trained to run register when they're busy they will pull you from your current job to run register.

Sales,"Wal-Mart can be a great place to work.  A typical day at the store begins with everyone getting involved during the morning meeting and chant the Wal-Mart Cheer.  Once disbursed each employee go to their perspective departments and begin zoning (finding ways to maintain the store appearance and department layout).  You can learn a lot at Wal-Mart and get things accomplished by working as a team.  It is a lot of work though to maintain each departments sales floor.  But, it can be enjoyable being surrounded by all the friendly faces who suppose to be there to provide shoppers with the best shopping experience and practicing the 10 foot rule.  I've seen the management team come and go.  But with a reputation like Wal-Mart only the most warmest and friendliest will do.  You must smile all day everyday.

Market level management has little Respect for Management at store level,"Walmart's company culture has the spirit of a great company to work for; however the message is often lost at the store level.

The fact is that the leadership style is  very much authoritarian and aggressively stresses a type X management style towards management and associates at the store level. There is always a constant fear of losing your job, which often  promotes a very tense work environment.

Review,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working with Walmart! As a cashier, it wasn't hard to be trained. You'll basically get your training through the CBL's that you'll do and when you first bag, you bag as you're comfortable. As time went on, I learned how to bag effectively without using unnecessary bags, unless requested. The only times I have found Walmart to get on my nerves, was when we ran COMPLETELY out of bags 5 times within a 4 month span. Another thing, they do not accept doctor's excuses and they run off of a point system, so for the first 6 months of working there, you've got 4 points you can get before you're fired and after you've worked there for 6 months, your points jump up to 9, but it is very inconvenient that they don't accept doctors excuses as a valid reason for missing a day. Overall, Walmart has been a great company, but could definitely use a change of management.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Troy, AL",4/29/18,2018,4,29

The hours are great but there are some things lacking.,"I work overnight Sunday through Friday Morning. I work really hard and I do my very best every night. I like working in apparel but I am put elsewhere when certain mangers are there. The management does not care about where you excel, they are all on a power trip.

Walmart is a large company - full time work is rare,Working at Walmart was a challenge in that they would never give you enough hours.  It was nearly impossible to make enough for bills.

Hard labor,"My experience working at Walmart Distribution is a labor intensive job. I have learned quite a bit as far as new experiences go working in a warehouse, as this was my first warehouse job. Management for Walmart is not exactly what I would see as good management, as they are quick to write you up, but not tell you what you did or how to improve. The employees there are generally good people and it can be a fun environment. I like the shift I work and the fact I do have four days during the week after working for three days. They pay well, but they use that to their advantage, as they say, ""they care about their employees.""

"Paid well, but very strict environment.","Walmart is so prideful on being the best, they don't allow any room for mistakes. Being human, I made several and they barely gave you any room.

Somewhat competitive but fast paced,A typical day at work involves collecting carts and keeping the parking lot clear. During my time there I learned how to move quickly while still getting the job. The management at Walmart were somewhat unorganized. Work culture was very fast paced and very competitive. The hardest part of the job was maintaining through the hot and cold weather.

Pro's and cons to this company,"They will tell you that they will work with you and your scheduling needs. May it be needed for family time or school. But in reality, when you start they put you however fits them best. I went to my manager about several issues and was informed. ""Either you can do the job or you can't."", ""I don't need to hear your problems"" or ""well what do you want me to do about it?"" This was in reference to needing to be home with my children some nights... Being that everyone knows I'm a single mother.

Also depending on which one you do it can be stressful with handful of customers you get on a daily.,3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Livonia, MI",4/28/18,2018,4,28
Not a great management but good coworkers,"Most coworkers on the low level were kind and acted like friends, however, management and other shifts acted like it was a competition.

A good base for jumping off of.,"A day at Walmart is always varied. Most days, things worked on a relatively smooth pace, but other days trucks would show up late, fellow employees would slow down, and productivity would be hindered. I learned to step up my game in times of need, provide humor and a welcoming ear to my fellow employees while maintaining a consistent pace with my work. Management was also as varied as the days, at times acting as both a leader and friend. Other times they acted more hostile from the stress put on them. That wasn't the hardest part, however. Time management was. Often times I've found myself trying to provide excellent customer service while simultaneously trying to complete my work in a quick and effective manner. That said, the best part of the job is the people I worked with, who often exuded a warm and friendly atmosphere.

Very Good Work Enveriment,"A Typical day working at Wal-Mart was mostly running the cash register and interacting with all the customers in line. I learned how to use their computerized register, cause not all registers are the same.I learned a lot more about the shift and customers more and more everyday.The management their is very laid back and also on point with their shift, if the shift needed assists they were always there to lend a helping hand. The workplace itself is a very clean and popular place to be. They don't discriminate and they don't judge anybody in the workplace. The hardest part about working there was learning everything for the first time and getting use to how it worked best for me to learn how to do things the right way the first time.

Poor Workplace & Organization,"Plain and simple, I would not recommend anyone working here. In this workplace, the bad outweighs the good. The pay and benefits are not good enough to stay and put up with the stress and junk that you will deal with. There are no chances for any type of promotion unless you are a brown noser and provide ""benefits"" to the managers. The raise sucks!

I worked an overnight shift so experiences may differ,While I worked there the managers were pretty awesome as were the coworkers.

My Experience,"During my time as an Assistant Manager, it was extremely difficult to maintain a work life balance as there was always more work to do then there was time in a regular shift.

out of touch,"Walmarts management team from my experience is very out of touch with its workers overall.

A great job for 23.5 years,"My workweek started at 6:30 am on Monday and I usually Stayed out until Friday in the early evening. I delivered and picked up freight to and from stores, clubs, distribution centers and vendors. The pace was fast but not unreasonable. Our local management team was always professional and ready to listen to ideas and help with problems. The culture when I was hired was what led to my desire to work there and then led me to retire. The change was so quick and so total that I had to go ahead with plans to retire 2.5 years earlier than I wanted to. The things that I miss the most are the great people that I worked with.

Favoritism,"The managers like to pick favorites out of the cashiers and if you arent a favorite then you wont get breaks on time and you wont get bathroom breaks when you need them. i was yelled at because i ""used the restroom too frequently"" when it was maybe twice in a 8 hour shift on the clock. They allowed their favorites to be late and wear leggings but when i was even two minutes late and wore pants that looked like leggings i would get written up. Other coworkers were allowed to wear all their piercings but i got yelled at for my nose ring.

Walmart Cashier Job,"Working at Walmart is often times stressful and exhausting as a cashier. This Walmart is the only one in Charleston while most cities of comparable size have 2-3 Walmart stores. It leads to a busy store where you will scan purchased items 2-3 hours straight  between breaks with no gap between customers. You are standing the entire shift and floors are tiles laid on concrete so it leads to body pain. Management is disconnected from the staff somewhat completely and has the expectation that employees work at all times and even if no customers are checking out a cashier must clean, fold clothes, and/or recruit customers to cash out at their line. The work environment is very often toxic and discouraging with poor to no communication between management and staff as well as multiple social cliques that are present in the workplace. Lateness and absenteeism is scored on a point system where even a proper call out using a sick day in many places of employment is accepted and understood, but Walmart penalizes the employee regardless. Many cash registers have broken belt switches and scan guns and the plastic bags provided at point of sale are very difficult to work with and lead to lost productivity. Walmart does provide each employee a discount card after 3 months of employment, quarterly profit share based on sales, provides frequent online training for store policy, offer career and education opportunities for those who are interested and occasionally provides some shifts with a holiday meal or promotional items, but the number of provided material is limited so most do not receive. - more...",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"South Charleston, WV",4/27/18,2018,4,27

fast paced,Wal-mart was very fast paced on busy days as a cashier and service desk rep. I think wal-mart is a good place to work it pays well and you're treated pretty fair but they will take up every bit of time you have.

Say Goodbye to Work/Life Balance,"While I feel the very top levels of management mean well and have good plans, something has gone terribly awry in the execution of their plans.  Store and Market level management seem to have no concern for their employees or their quality of life.  My work days are filled with last-minute projects dumped on me for other areas of the store, frequently interfering with my actual job duties.  This results in having to come in early, stay late, not taking any lunch or rest breaks and still not getting my work done.

Also the whole ""the customer is always right"" statement will always be used against you.

Most employees either came in to work high or drunk, or they left on their lunch break to get high and/or drunk.

Nice place to work,I enjoyed working at Walmart. A typical day would be to get signed on to your computer and begin to work. You would get 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute or 1 hour lunch you prefer. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was on flextime.

"Can be peaceful, but generally negative.","The job hours are inconsistent, ranging from 9 hours in a day to less than 5 hours. The managers are for the most part un approchable and don't know how to talk with people. Breaks are not clearly explained in the orientation process.

Walmart expected a lot of work done with little people to do it.,"My Walmart store itself was a very good work environment, but as a company itself it is a different story.  Management and employees were forced to do the work of multiple people and reprimanded if it wasn't done.  They provided quarterly ""bonuses"" to employees if their store met certain criteria.  The problem with these bonuses is that they forced store management to cut employees hours at the same time they were receiving them.  Therefore the bonuses received equaled out to their typical paychecks.  Short staffing forced employees to deal with constant belittlement from customers as to why more registers weren't open and why they had no one to help them.",2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Marietta, GA",4/23/18,2018,4,23

I had so many times my family had a gathering and I couldn't go because I had work, my sister even got mad at me because she told me a week before the event and I was scheduled to work and couldn't go.

There are still amazing people that work for WalMart and I am sure not everywhere is like my area.

Walmart is awful,"Walmart is...well, strictly an awful place to work. It's kind of cult-like, if I'm being honest.

Then there is corporately-mandated stretches, followed by a chant of ""1, 2, 3, Walmart!"" There is nothing more humiliating, in my mind, as it shows that Walmart thinks of it's employees as soulless drones...which does accurately describe the management. If you accidentally stayed one minute past your corporately-provided 15 minute break or your one-hour lunch break, the management would treat it as if you were stealing directly from the company. The work is massive and thankless. I was stationed in the grocery section, and would regularly receive three or even four palettes worth of merchandise to stock in an eight hour period, with the management and the company expecting you to finish this task as if you were Superman, as the game. I was told that I was expected to unseal, identify, and stock items at a rate of one hundred and twenty cases per hour, which is patently impossible. The company was nice enough to give us a lunch periodically, such as burgers or fresh fruit or even pizzas, but fequently, the weekend donuts are the day olds no one wants to eat, the pizzas were burnt beyond recognition, and the burgers were provided by the kind managers who wanted to reward us for a job well done.

HIred as an Electronics Associate but usually required to cashier,"Walmart's Customer Service Managers were ineffective in managing their department staff. Their failure to ensure adequate staffing required them to remove staff from other departments to serve as cashiers. This occurred on a daily basis. They lack leadership skills. For example, while staff from other departments served as cashiers to cover their department the Customer Service Managers merely stood at the entry to checkout lanes directing customers. Effective leaders pitch in to cover shortages. There always were several customer Service managers on duty and they should have taken initiative tp help operate their department. I was assigned to work in Electronics but wasn't given the opportunity to learn my job duties because within a minute of clocking in I was reassigned to work a register.  If you want to be a cashier you will have opportunities to work..",3,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Shrewsbury, MO",4/20/18,2018,4,20

Amazing management,"I worked for 3 different stores, on and off, for almost 12 years. In that time, I have come to hold a certain level of respect and awe for the management teams at each store. From the lowest hourly managers all the way up to salaried managers, they manage to make you feel like you are one of the family. Of all the bad things I could put on here about working for Walmart, they are far, far outweighed by the fact that, no matter how bad your home-life is getting, if you go to your manager and explain what's going on, they will work with you to make sure you don't end up unemployed, as well._x000D__x000D_If you're looking for a new job, and can't find something in your field, give Walmart a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised; I promise.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Desk ,"Dublin, VA and Columbia, MO",4/20/18,2018,4,20
"Great for a young person who cannot work 40 hours, not so great for an adult who needs the money and wants to advance in the company","As a young person in college, most companies would be very proud to have you and would like you to move up their company do to the college experience. This however is not true. Walmart does not care about your education, they care if you are available to work 10 hour days for seven days a week or not. The management is allowed to speak to you however they want and your ability to move out of a department is slim to none. I've worked at Walmart for two years. They raised the minimum pay to 11.00. I now make the same amount of money as someone who just started their first day.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Oak Ridge, TN",4/20/18,2018,4,20

"Friendly Environment, Easy Work, Strict Managment.","In my Walmart I worked with 3 other Cart Pushers, you would do your job and have a little time to talk on the side or while you were working.

A good way to start out working,"As my first job, Walmart was doable. I started right out of high school and worked at one location up until I had to relocate for finishing up my degree. I was assigned to one department but as time went on I was asked to learn the how-to in several other departments (at least five others). As the algorithm changed, so did what was expected of me. So if change isn't your strong suit, I wouldn't suggest this retailer. Managers were reasonable when it came to the work but nice people overall. I didn't get benefits because I couldn't manage staying full time my entire length of employment (I was a student for the duration of my employment). It's definitely minimum wage, but for what it is it did the job I needed it to do: help me pay my bills and keep me afloat throughout the beginning of my college career. I left because I transferred schools but did not transfer locations (which they sincerely wanted me to do).",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Mukwonago, WI",4/20/18,2018,4,20

Poor Management,"Really enjoyed my job at Walmart and the other associates I worked with, but getting pulled in between managers with poor management skills was the final straw on the camels back for me! You will be working on accomplishing something a manager ask you to do and in the middle of it another manager will show up wanting you to stop what your doing and pull you off to something they think is more important and then the previous manager shows back up wanting to chew on you for not finishing what they told you to do because the other manager pulled you away to do something else! It’s like running around in a circle chasing your tail all day long and never getting anything accomplished!

"Walmart, not as bad as you'd think","If you need a job where you get a lot of hours, Walmart can typically make that work. They aren't super flexible with off time, but that's the tradeoff for getting so many hours.",4,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Irvine, CA",4/19/18,2018,4,19

A Repetitive and Unchallenging Job,"Walmart is a tedious and boring job. It sucks the majority of your time up and doesn't pay enough.

Walmart will take all of your time, never pay you enough, and give all the overtime to the managers.",3,Former Employee,Cashier and Stocker ,"Cincinnati, OH",4/19/18,2018,4,19
Not bad for a starter or temporary job,"Walmart isn't too bad of a place to work.  Most of the employees are nice and helpful.

dirty,no one ever cleaned after doing a job so when you would go to use the equipment you would get really dirty and nasty and they play the same ten songs all day. shoppers don't notice but it drove me nuts. do me a favor next time you are in walmart and they are playing Breakfast At Tiffanys song tell them to turn it off NOW.,2,Former Employee,Tire Lube Express Associate ,"Martinsville, IN",4/19/18,2018,4,19

Overall Walmart is a good company to work for,"At the time, I had some mental issues going on and did miss alot of work.  The system was a point system, one-half point for late or leaving early and one point for missing a full day.  My points at the time continued to stay at a level that I should have been fired, but due to my mental issues, the manager worked with me to keep in on staff.  It was my decision to leave, since I did not feel it was fair to the other staff.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Yukon, OK",4/19/18,2018,4,19

Too much stress and poor management,"In my opinion, Wal-mart is not the worst place in the world to work. However, if you are a hard working individual who takes pride in their work, the typical day consists of management expecting the impossible. You will be used and abused without any appreciation. Many customers get upset/angry when you are doing your job to the best of your abilities while abiding by the rules. It is strenuous work and it only gets worse as times goes on. _x000D__x000D_Wal-mart also hires anyone that can breathe. There is not accountability, communication, or training. Changing job titles/codes is nearly impossible. Expect to be thrown in the deep end of the pool.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Springville, UT",4/19/18,2018,4,19

A Typical Day At work,"Usually since I work at night, there is not a lot of customers left in the store, that gives the employees freedom to get there work done in a manner without interruptions. if there are some left in the store I am more than happy to accommodate them. Management is okay to work with, as in all jobs you have some that are great and some that could use some more managerial skills with people. I get along with both, because I am a people oriented person. I don't consider none of my job hard because I do what must be done, if it is unloading a large piece truck alone or stocking the dairy alone, it is part of the job.",4,Former Employee,Dept. Manager ,"Raleigh, NC",4/19/18,2018,4,19

Paced workplace with descent management,"A typical night at work was just stocking the shelves of the grocery section, and during the time I worked there I learned to pace myself to work faster and more efficiently. My supervisors were strict and thorough but sometimes could be unorganized. During the night it was a quiet and laid back workplace because there were no customers in the store. The hardest part working there was pacing myself to get tasks done on time when my supervisor gave me multiply tasks. My co-workers was the most enjoyable part working there.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Columbus, GA 31906",4/19/18,2018,4,19

"Productive, fun and learning experience","A typical day working at Walmart you just have to go in knowing that you are there to do you job, there will be customer that come in having a bad day and just might take it out on you, but smile greet your customer and wish them well.What I have learned my 4years of being employed with Walmart is that everyday will not be a good day but as long as you go in and give your best it will all be worth it on payday.Dealing with management is like pulling teeth at times, its a lot of favoritism and I just try my best to learn most of the work on my own but if there a reason I must speak to management I try to make it brief and make sure it something extremely important.The workplace culture is divided and I cam honestly say everyone does seem to work well together.The hardest part of this job is when you first start and your trainers and supervisor are lazy and don't want to help out when you feel lost or need help.The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting greet people and being able to provide great customer service even to those who aren't having such a great day and they actually tell you thank you for being such a great help because today wasn't a good day for them until they came to Walmart, being able to put a smile one someone face make your job so much worth it.",5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Tallahassee, FL",4/19/18,2018,4,19
"Supportive co workers, but poor management","I enjoyed working with the team I had. We worked well together and team members would step in wherever needed.

Enjoying a job like this really depends on your management team.,When I first arrived at Walmart it was great. months went by and I began to notice unfair treatment to other employees. I  didn't agree and spoke out. then the scene flipped. I worked extremely hard and received very little acknowledgment for it. WORKING AT WALMART BECAME BS. because of a few ASSISTANT managers who disliked me. all in the spirit of competition I guess. they praised the minuscule of tasks done by some. Yet completely overlook any immense effort put out from my end. good luck!,3,Former Employee,Stocker/Cashier ,"San Antonio, TX",4/19/18,2018,4,19
Decent job,Very good place to work for a first time job or as part time. Management is usually willing to work with your scedule and workdays are typically standard 8 hour shifts with an hour lunch.

a Typical day,I would arrive at Walmart at around 10pm. I would begin to break down all the boxes according to what aisles they would be going into. I would then take the product out of the boxes and put it where it needed to go accordingly. I would also help customers with any needs that they had as far as customer service goes.,3,Former Employee,Night Stocker ,"Glendale, AZ 85308",4/18/18,2018,4,18
not worth the time,expect a lot of work to be done for such low pay.Managers expect things to be done in half hour even though it requires more time. they expect perfection for low pay.,1,Former Employee,OVERNIGHT STOCKER ,"Duarte, CA",4/18/18,2018,4,18
No room for advancement,When an opening opens up they hire you on who you know and how high that person you know is. Management doesn't do much in the long run in total I think I saw management do their job twice and both times was when they were following me to try to get dirt on me so they could fire me.

Awful,"The walmart I worked at was awful. I did things outside of my assigned title (like running returns).The managers and my coworkers teased me for my height and called me a little kid.

Not The Best Experience,"While I loved all my co-workers and didn't mind the work I was doing, Walmart as a company is not the best place to work.

It's a good place to start,"Walmart is one of those places where you are expected to move a mountain with only a shovel while on a unicycle. Add angry customers (there's always angry customers) and you have yourself a really frustrating day. That being said, I personally think that everyone should work at Walmart at least once in their life to learn extreme patience and overall learn how to work with the general public. That tool has helped me personally through life and taught me to keep a level head when a customer is in your face. I've learned to not engage in their argument if you get the sense that their soul purpose of being at Walmart is to complain to someone. It's a good starting place for those who don't have employment, and I have high respect for those who have worked there for years and years. It is a thankless job. But, there can be some really nice people who are very appreciative of the work you do. And you look at those people and think, ""this is why I do what I do."" I have made some amazing friends who work with me. There is a family at Walmart within the coworker atmosphere. Management can be very inconsistent, or expect you to know things there's no way you'd ever know. That being said, overall I think Walmart is not an easy job, but it can be very rewarding. The hardest part is doing the same thing day in and day out. It's hard to stay. But if you do, you won't regret it.",3,Current Employee,Front End Associate ,"Cleveland, OH",4/18/18,2018,4,18

Productive workplace,"It is a fast-pace workplace; they will expect you to multi-task at times. Some management will help, some will not.

It all depends...,"Working for this employer depends mostly, if not entirely, upon the management within the particular store that you work for. If communication and respect and knowledge and effective leadership aren't all present within each of the members of the managerial staff, then it is hard to feel like you work for a store that runs smoothly, much less appreciates you. It also becomes more difficult to care about doing a good job, when you don't see good leadership. I have worked for some stores that have good managers and others that don't so much.",3,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Pittsburg, KS",4/18/18,2018,4,18

Me at Walmart,"When I first start off my day Walmart I  first help out with the front end manger by flipping the money before 12:00 am, and then I hop on the register to check out customers. After doing that it starts to get slow and i help clean the registers or stock on the floor. I've learn how to do returns and cash checks. I also learn how to stock in different  departments of the store. Management is good, but there are some that don't know what there doing but there are others that are very good at there job and great with communication with workers and customers. The hardest part to my job is my sleep schedule. The most enjoyable thing I do at Walmart is helping the customers and getting the job done with a smile.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Fredericksburg, VA",4/18/18,2018,4,18
Poor Management,"Poor management, managers were rude to employees in front of customers. They are not held accountable for their lack of management skills. The company does not take customer complaints seriously which is a big concern.

"the ""pay raise"" is a scam","the advertised ""starting salary"" of $10/hr was a scam, they start you at 9 and give you 60 days to complete computer based training or they fire you. however, you are not allowed to do this training on your own time, nor can you take time off your normally scheduled shift to do this training. they will not schedule time for you to do this computer training either. they set you up to fail.",1,Former Employee,Fuel Station Attendant ,"Lawton, OK",4/18/18,2018,4,18

Not a good company to work for.,Upper management and Home Office doesn't care about employees well being. The pay doesn't cover most of people expenses.

There aren't steady hours for most people so work/life balance is tough to do as well.,2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Bridgeton, NJ",4/18/18,2018,4,18

Was good in beginning,"I worked here about 2 years as part time, and suddenly management demanded that I work hours that were against my availability or I'd be given no hours at all. The hierarchy in management is crazy, as it starts with the market manager yelling and then to the store manager, to the assistants, and finally to the associates. The departments are overworked and understaffed, yet they assume we should be able to have everything done perfectly. Management will flip-flop back and forth on their word. Lastly, if you are part-time, a student, or have a second job they do not work with you and want you to treat wal-mart as your career.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Foothill Ranch, CA",4/17/18,2018,4,17

Good place if you don't mind working with the public,"It's not really a job I would say I really enjoy but you would like it if you are a people person.  Management at our store isn't the best but they will work with you if necessary, you just have to find them and keep on them about what you need.

Management team makes the store,"I transferred from one state to another. I came from an area that would clear at least 100k a day per store to an area where 100k seems like and easy mil. Well the particular store I managed was run by a manager that prided herself in running things like a Super center went it was a smaller tier store. Her mantra was to work more with less. So when it came time to start letting people go, she refused to hire anyone to fill the need for an overnight crew, (which you need to put your store back together every night.) as far as the rest of the management was concerned, they all fell in line with the store manager meanwhile i decided to go against her. Her store now has the highest turnover rate in the area.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Support Manager ,"Goldsboro, NC",4/17/18,2018,4,17

Good place to work with a lot of opportunity,VPI and upper management for the company need to take out time send someone to the stores anonymously see what the management team is feeling see what your Associate's is feeling about their store.

It is not a great place for those who prefer calmer environments. _x000D_Having the 10% off associate discount was awesome! _x000D_I did not feel like I made a difference in the world while I was working there, but it did help me pay for school and support myself and husband, which makes a difference even though it was indirect.

After working for 3 years in this area, I transferred to Garden/Seasonal, here I would keep the plants watered, displayed properly and the area organized.

Very unstable,My experience started out very positive. Then they started cutting hours due to the budget. You never knew from one minute to the next if you were going to have a job. There was never such a thing as a job well done. If you went above and beyond to complete a task or project. There was never a good job. What could you do better the next time if they even noticed,2,Former Employee,Department Manager/Sales Associate ,"Sterling, CO",4/17/18,2018,4,17

"Great co-workers, a lot of work for students","A typical day at work for a cashier would be counting the money in your draw and make sure you'd be okay for your shift, cleaning your area, greeting customers with a smile and being friendly to them. I learned a lot from working here, considering it was my first job. I was 16 at the time and everyone there was very welcoming and very easy to talk to. The manager there was great. He always went out of his way to make sure all of his employees were doing okay and made sure they felt comfortable. The vibes around this workplace were amazing. I definitely think the hardest part for me was working late at night, as a full time student. I had to squeeze in an hours worth of homework on a 15 minute break. Other than that, I never wanted to leave that place. The most enjoyable part has to be the presence of my co workers. There were so many types of people from teenagers, to elders, to disable people.

Stressful but Nice place to work,"The work here and how well the day goes all depends on the customers. The reason for this is since most work happens out on the sales floor of the store where you will encounter customers constantly while you work. It was great lesson in learning how to give good customer service but, sometimes very stressful in dealing with customers. You have to pick up on how important it is to do the best you can and giving 100%. This comes into play a lot when dealing with management. They are good mangers who have put in the time to be where they are and do care about the company. Some-times it may feel like your work isn't appreciated, that they can be tough/unfair  or lazy but, the truth they have a lot to deal with and can be under maned at times. They do the best they can with the people, work, and co-workers they have to deal with. Many of the people who work there are very friendly people who like to help others.

Skip this employer,"After working for this employer for 9 1/2 years i would have to say do not work here. They do not follow any policy, nor do they care about their employees. Even more so after the new customer based work schedule was put into effect. This caused my department to go from a good work flow of 2 morning workers, 2 mid workers, 2 evening workers to a minimal 2 to 3, 4 if you were lucky. the worst part is the customer volume schedule which breaks it into when people are buying things. This means they are going by last years numbers which are never the same twice. So that translates to one person coming in at 7 am to be all alone all day til 1 pm when 2 or 3 more people know show up. Managers are not aloud to charge these schedules as they are monitored by higher  management. If they change it to fix the bad margins they will be coached or written up for it. Also due to this new system if you are a student or a single mother/father who has outside duties and you schedule is restricted you won't get any hours be cause the hours you have for walmart are not open enough. They force you to open you hours from 7 am to 11pm everyday, no days where you can't come in. The only way around it is to dual code yourself, which means you would be a grocery and a housewares associate or any other random department they deem is open. This means you can be double scheduled because no one talks to each other to make you sure you aren't doubled up. so you could end up 7-10 in grocery then 1 -10 in hardware.

great benefits and many opportunities to advance,Walmart is a fast paced workplace. The benefits and opportunities to advance are many but not many people take the chance to move up because they don't want to deal with the extra conflicts that come with being a manager. My experience as not only a stocker but management you see that favoritism runs the store. The hardest part of the job comes when you come in contact with a superior that isn't too fond of you. They will do whatever they can to get you out of the way for the lack of a better word.

Decent work place,Walmart Distribution was a decent work place. Everyone was treated far and every was taught very thoroughly how to conduct their job. At that particular warehouse a team of two people had to print and tag our own flow stickers & also had to unload and load our truck,3,Former Employee,Warehouse Worker ,"Port Wentworth, GA",4/16/18,2018,4,16
Job had its perks like flexable hours.,"Walmart wants you to work as hard as you can as fast as you can then they tell you to go home early because there is nothing else to do.  Overtime was prohibited, you may be written up if you exceeded 40 hours if you were full time. There would be times when all of a sudden they don't need you to work for a week or 2 and then they may call you in for an extra shift but then reward you by making you leave early so you don't get overtime. They expect you do bend over backwards for then but they will not do it for you.",1,Former Employee,Personall Associate/Training Coordinator ,Smyrna TN,4/16/18,2018,4,16
Pharmacy Tech,This review is for pharmacy staff only and may not apply to the outside department. Workload and requirements to meet certain score and expectations continuously increase however the compensation does not. They are slowly starting to get stringent even though they are a fortune 500 company. Lots of hours cutting and management being forced to schedule the amount of techs in a day based on last years script count in the previous year which doesn't make sense because business is sometime slow and sometimes fast and can't be predicted in that manor. Lot's of management positions also being dissolved and more responsibility on a higher up manager so the company can make more money. It's a great place for hard working people with great benefits if you have a family. The company lets you set your availability so the managers have to follow. Some may love this job and stay for life and other may need to move on to obtain some growth in their career.,5,Current Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,Georgia,4/16/18,2018,4,16
Its very good but has lazy managers,Good place to work and very stressful also. You have to have a good attitude at all times. The managers care more anout themselves than the sales associates.,2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Millington, TN",4/16/18,2018,4,16

Exciting Place to work,I liked working at Walmart because I had experience in handling cash transactions. I knew how to run a register. It was a pretty easy job as well but it required alot of standing. I am not used to standing for long periods of time. I can stand for a few hours but longer than that is hard on my back. I liked the people that I worked with. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to use customer service skills and having the ability to talk to customers as you check them out through your register. Sometimes you have interesting conversations with people that you don't even know and by the time they leave your register and head out of the store you kind of know a little bit about that customer.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Springdale, AR",4/16/18,2018,4,16
"If they like you, you stay","This place has too many people that use their jobs to pull up the people they like personally and to drag down those they don't like.

the harder you work the more your expected to cover for others,"Your training is computer based and if you do it wrong they will let you know but hard to get real help from management, you don't get much praise otherwise really on if you exceeded your sales for the day do it for the week and then well do it for the month now (so don't expect much) your expected to ""network"" your job essential resources because they are constantly lost i.e. hand held devices you have to have to do your job. You have many managers and they all require and/or want something different, so you will redo and move product consistently just because of whose working that day. Management will throw you under the bus to save themselves so you have to constantly cover your own self. Atmosphere with fellow associates is very much like high school, clingy and drama, not the most professional.",1,Former Employee,Orderfiller @D.C & Dept.

poor management and always a joke,at the time I worked at wal-mart the management was poor and did not care for the employees. they did not care about any issues that occurred and would rarely addressed them.

Wal-mart doesn't care,"Wal-mart's management is largely uncaring of what happens to their employees unless it in some way impacts the company  - negatively, that is. Some managers are supportive, but it varies by location and department. Most just don't seem to care at all while there are a few who play favorites and hold grudges. Just one bad manager can affect the whole atmosphere of the job. _x000D_Rules are randomly enforced which plays into the playing favorites part and rule also change sporadically and often unexpectedly.  Hours are only as flexible as the situation calls for it i.e. whether your management feels like working with you. The personnel actively discourage you from changing your hours and often threaten that you might LOSE hours if you do, regardless of how minor the change._x000D_This might all seem petty, but it really created a negative work environment at both Wal-marts I worked at. I was lucky at the most recent store because my department manager was one of the few supportive ones and did her best to work with me on whatever I needed._x000D_The only real plus is that Wal-mart doesn't seem too picky about who they hire - for good or ill - so if you really need a job it's almost like a safety net; a safety net that chafes in the most uncomfortable spots anyway.",2,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Garland, TX",4/15/18,2018,4,15

They take care of their employees. I appreciate that one.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Chandler, AZ",4/15/18,2018,4,15
Varied,"Depending on your assistant manager, work could be either alright or a nightmare, same goes for your co workers, they come in all flavors. Luckily personnel rotation at Walmart is high, so you can wait out for the ASM's to get rotated to other departments. Advancement depends on how chummy you are with management regardless of skill. The pay is probably the worst part, near minimum wage, granted its not the hardest place to work at. Co workers can be a pain whether it be attitude or laziness.",3,Former Employee,Order Fulfillment Associate ,"Dixon, CA",4/15/18,2018,4,15
A good franchise to work with depending on which one you work at.,"A typical day at work would start off slow depending on the day and end up with a rush of customers and barely not getting in trouble for going like a minute or two over your 15 minute break and then you are never on the same register during your shift and they are very inconsistent with the schedule because its not their fault people call out almost everyday. I learned to not make friends at work and to just got to work to do your job because everyone is all for themselves and some of the managers at my location were very stuck up and thought a little management job was everything and then you had some who were cool and knew how to act. The hardest part of the job was having to keep your mouth shut with all the rude customers and having to listen to ""If it doesn't ring up its free!"" that came along with an annoying laugh following after. The enjoyable part was some of the people that worked there because although they wouldn't be doing their job most of the time they were pretty hilarious.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Glen Burnie, MD 21060",4/15/18,2018,4,15

A great place to work if the managment wouldn't change constantly.,While working at Walmart I made a lot of friends among my fellow co-workers. We would all talk while red lining and waiting for customers to check out. We also would make sure that our lane was in good condition and provide excellent customer service. However the biggest problem that I had with working there was the fact that managment was constantly chaning. I would come into work and I would have a new front end manager. It made it confusing on who I was suppose to report to and they were also never avaible when you needed to talk to them.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Ogallala, NE",4/15/18,2018,4,15

"Fast paced, steady customer flow, enjoyable","Overall I had a great time working for Walmart. Benefits were not that bad at all. You could get health, dental, vision, life, and even 401 k. Getting in with Walmart Stock was a good idea too. I was a sales floor associate. Which means that I ran a register, stocked freight, completed modular, and helped customers find merchandise. Most of the time the job was very enjoyable. I got along with almost all the employees in the store. Management collaborated pretty well. Most were professional and actually listened to what you had to say. Store Manager ran the store quite well. Summer time and Christmas were the big times for the store. There were many days that required you to move pallets and pallets of heavy merchandise so by the end of the day you would be completely exhausted. The store was 24 hours so, depending on what your job title was would determine what hours you worked. I could work anytime between 7am and 11pm. There would be multiple times where you would go over your hours. Sometimes overtime would be approved and sometimes it wouldn't be. When it came to customers, you would have quite a few that were very well mannered. And then, of course, you would have those that would treat you like absolute dirt no matter what and showed you zero respect.",4,Former Employee,SPORTING GOODS SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Morehead City, NC",4/15/18,2018,4,15

"Good coworkers, Extremely bad management","First off, you will get written up/counseled over items that they really shouldn't.  You can get written up for missing work due to a documented VA disability interfering with your life.  There is also no policy protecting the members of the workforce from abuse by the management.  There is no safeguards for unknown write-ups.  The team member doesn't acknowledge the first two write-ups, so you can get written up twice before you will know it.  The third write-up can be you getting fired.  They're supposed to counsel you on what you did wrong and what to do to correct it, but there is nothing for the member to sign to prove that the counseling ever happened.  This is in my most humble opinion very poor on their part and should be illegal.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Greeneville, TN",4/14/18,2018,4,14

"Decent pay, stressful working conditions","Depending on what your job is depends on what your job will be like. On average though, I have found that Walmart is often understaffed, so the workload is bigger than it should be. Some managers are great and help, while others do not help at all and push the whole shift for everyone to complete tasks that are sometimes unreasonable, or the time allowed to complete is unreasonable/unrealistic. Walmart is not a bad place to work overall, however, it is often extremely stressful. Customers can be pretty rude, and with the constant flow of people shopping, it can effect how much work you can actually complete. If you have people who work as hard as you, and are fun to be around, it can be fun to work sometimes.",3,Current Employee,Stocker/Cart Pusher ,"Colorado Springs, CO",4/13/18,2018,4,13

doesn't care about anything if it doesn't impact them,"unless you are on great terms with the manager because you suck up to them, you aren't going to get anything fixed. you'll be the hardest working person in your department, but they will give the hours to the lazier and slower workers, rather than the faster harder working ones. i get told ""I can't fix your schedule by adding hours, nor can i add shifts for someone else to help you out"" the very next day she adds a person for a 3pm-10pm shift, then creates a 7-4 shift for him, kept editing the cashiers schedules to give them 40 hours, but when i'm full time, i was rarely seeing 33 hours a week since march began.

Productive and fun place to work with ping pong table.,"A typical day at work for me at Jet.com was to clock in, return to the receiving dock for standup and stretches, and receive my duties for the day. I learned all about the inbound procedures for a warehouse and how to properly receive merchandise into the building from the trucks. Management on my end of the building was excellent. I enjoyed my managers through and through. It was a fun workplace to be a part of for the most part except seeing some management partaking in ping pong matches during the workday for hours. The hardest part about working there was picking for me just because it was a lot of back and forth in the beginning and I was not accustomed to walking long distances. I enjoyed being able to listen to music throughout the day and having the ability to converse with my co-workers while getting our jobs done.",3,Former Employee,Shipping and Receiving Clerk ,"McCarran, NV",4/13/18,2018,4,13
"A good starting place, but do not make a career unless you start at management.","Wal-Mart does not like giving full-time, and they give you as much work as they can without breaking labor laws or giving benefits.

Not worth the stress,"I started out with high hopes working at Walmart. I came back as an overnight stocker. I was quickly promoted as an overnight Customer Service manager. During this time they used me as an acting overnight Support Manager due to store hours changing from 24 hours to closing at midnight.  Once the store started closing at midnight i was told that because I was not in my position as long as the other over night Customer Service manager that I would either have to take a severance package, go back to stocking which would cause me to lose $2.00 in hourly pay or I could pick a different position in the store.  I chose to work over night due to family obligations so that was not an option. I was then offered officially the Overnight Support Manager position and gracefully accepted.  I was in the role for over a year when I found out again i would be losing that position because we had too many Supports overnight. I was told I could accept the overnight maintenance supervisor position so I could keep the same pay.  I was then informed that I would not be keeping my pay and lost $2.75 in pay. The company has no communication and they like to make up rules and not pay you what you deserve.",1,Current Employee,Overnight Support Manager/Maintenance Supervisor ,"Westminster, CO",4/13/18,2018,4,13

Poor pay and Benefits,I liked my job and the management was good. Did not like the limited health benefits and lack of comprehensive coverage. The pay was not enough to live on even with a second job. They boast that only 25% of their employees have to get Government Financial Assistance.

Horrid experience,This was my first full time job after high school. At the time I was hired I was the only one over 18 so I was required to work on the alcohol/cigarette lane every day and even when my shift ended I had to wait until the next shift came in before I could get off that lane. This was usually at least a hour of overtime every day. After 3 months I was moved to the electronics department for my morning shifts and unfortunately a small item was stolen. Walmart management told me the funds for that item would come out of my check because I wasn't able to stop the thief. After that I refused to work in the electronics section because I felt stopping thieves is the loss & prevention team's job not mine. I was demoted and moved to clothing and after that they cut my hours to almost half and I knew I could not stay much longer.,2,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Aurora, CO",4/13/18,2018,4,13

Best place to work in regards of hourly wage,"After working with Walmart for well over a year, I've concluded that Walmart is in fact a good place to work for if you're looking for something either temporary or wanting to really move up within the ranks i.e. becoming a manager. However due to some people working there and depending on the management, working there can prove extremely stressful at times, even to the point where some may quit or just not be happy working there. Equipment is pretty scarce in that many employees including some managers have to hide equipment/materials in order for them to be able to do their jobs. The most difficult part of working is not the work itself, but the interactions with the other staff and customers, some of these customers and staff can prove to be very hard to deal with, and are sometimes confrontational and prove to be hard handle. The best part I could say working for Walmart is the pay, the pay isn't the greatest, but for 12 dollars and hour with the addition for having 4 bonuses per year you can say it's one of the best places to work for in our local area if you're wanting the most pay from a company.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Modular Team Member ,"Chiefland, FL",4/12/18,2018,4,12

Prime example of corporate america,Management has the intelligence equivalent of a walnut. Unless you make no incentive on actual improvement and do what your told despite obvious issues revolving in the same door as their employees.

"fun but can be stressful, management has a pretty good personality","I love working at my Walmart store and I have a deep relationship with almost everyone I know. A typical day is very busy for my job title but I love staying busy and active. There is always something to do and new to learn. I have learned so much over my years as a supervisor about the depths of running a business and working with a variety of people, learning strengths and weaknesses and finding a balance to get the achievement that is best for the associates and the business. The culture is very diverse but in our store, everyone works together as a team to get the job done and help teach others and new associates. The hardest part of my day is mostly dealing with vendors to get them to work with the store to deliver the results for a business we need OR finding a balance of the work load if we have a lot of associate call outs due to weather or illnesses. The most enjoyable part of my job is staying busy and working with a lot of great people, we are always sharing a good laugh while we work and helping the customers!",4,Current Employee,Claims Supervisor ,"Catskill, NY",4/11/18,2018,4,11

Management will tell you things to do but most of the time very little to no detail is given on how to do it or even the specifics of what is actually wanted, this results in employees feeling as if they have been thrown out into the deep with a live dies sink or swim approach.

Walmart,Walmart was a just a job for me. There wasn't opportunity for advancement that would offer better pay due to the shift differential. They hired me at a lower rate than they are hiring new employees and did not raise the current employees to the rate that the new employees are receiving.

Poor leadership and high turnover.,Leaders are set each day on firing someone.  Culture is awful.  Atmosphere is similiar to a bad high school.  Fights and shouting and accidents are common.  Working there has given me a true reflection of walmart and it is the worst place I have ever worked.  Respect for the individual does not exist.  The leadership falsifies corrective action; and policies change hand in hand when they get caught making an error.  Run from this place.  I won't even shop there due to their treatment of others.,1,Former Employee,Area Manager ,"Plainfield, IN",4/10/18,2018,4,10

Terrible Company,Walmart has made a lot of recent advancements to improve their wages. The new-hires are compensated much more appropriately while the employees who have been there for 3+ years are not compensated and end up making the same amount as the new hires. This structure supports high turn overs within departments. High turn overs creates a lot of stress because of regular associates often knowing more than their managers when they are looking to be lead. The best policy at walmart is to learn what your manager likes and cater to them specifically when they're on shift.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager/Associate ,"Fallon, NV 89406",4/10/18,2018,4,10

complicated,"Working at Walmart is busy. There's always something that needs to be done.  Walmart has helped me work productively at a fast pace, carry multiple conversations at once, and keep a positive attitude through difficult situations. What I like most about this job is the diversity of people. What I dislike the most and the reason I am leaving the company is that they are not consistent.

Great Entry Level learning Experience to develop strong leaders in the workplace.,"The job as a whole isn't entirely difficult. It takes application and reactive and pro-active planning as well as problem solving but the unethical and unrealistic expectations of the supervisors at my store would wear anyone down over time. A typical day includes cleaning up the mess from the prior shift and positioning inventory in the backroom to be able to stock shelves as well as handle customer concerns. All while trying to maintain a clean and safe workplace. _x000D_Regularly having to handle hairy encounters with disgruntled customers. The culture is very dependent on the environment. A bit of hostility in certain areas but with the community it is not surprising.The hardest part is going to work and expecting anything to go as planned. Its a very reactive environment with a lot of possibilities. Covering multiple positions and having to explain yourself to your supervisor as to why your personal tasks have not been completed is difficult. It has taught me to accept my faults and that I can't do everything, nor will I accept being degraded or disrespected for unrealistic work expectations.The most enjoyable part was when the associates worked together in completing the task under intense circumstances.

Walmart - Bemidji,"My employment experience at Bemidji Walmart entailed maintaining fresh areas: deli, bakery, produce, meats, dairy, frozen, and dry grocery. This position was not limited to the fresh areas, I was also responsible for general merchandise. As a supervisor, all departments need to run smoothly throughout the day.

Along with making sure that all the salads are out to be sold. You had make sure that all the out of date stuff was pulled from the shelves.

I was just getting the ""big picture,"" managing Bakery, when I was told I would need to take on about half of a store and probably transfer to another store, further away.

Without it there is no way for a business to be successful.  Taking pride in the work that I do and to be the best that I can be everyday is important. Management depending on whom is rotated into the department can have a rippling effect.  Unfortunately most of them have never or very briefly had training in the department that they are over, so their is not a lot  of building off of experience.  Everyone is always rushing to put out fires instead of finding a smarter way of working and ending up overworking and being unappreciative to the workers. The best part of the job is that through working their you make personal connections with associates which makes the work day better and though those days make lasting relationships.",3,Current Employee,Receiving Clerk ,"Statesboro, GA 30458",4/9/18,2018,4,9

Good money if you can handle the job,"I like that we get raises and bonuses. The pay is good. I don’t lik that I don’t have a set schedule and the managers I’m under never want to help. They break rules set by corporate or district managers all the time and then do the right thing when they come in. You can never get a manager to come to you within a reasonable amount of time. Love that we get two breaks and an hour lunch, but without a set schedule you almost never know when they’re going to be or if they will be on time. Hard to have a social life outside of work at all because you always work crazy hours and sometimes I have to work until 11pm and come back in the next day at 7am so I get no sleep.",4,Current Employee,Self Checkout Host/Cashier ,"Parkersburg, WV",4/9/18,2018,4,9
Stability,If you are on weekend shifts 40 hours is not guaranteed especially after holiday season has come and gone. Stability in management is horrible. The stability of management could be better.

Wallmart,"Poor management which never heard of reason, they simply don't care for anything or anyone, and neither do they know how to be a manager simply because they don't get trained for it, and have no qualifications to be one.

Walmart Life,Walmart can be a good place or a bad place to work just depends on your managers.

Nice relaxed place to work,"The typical day for me at Walmart was exhausting because I would be coming straight from practice going to work and pushing carts is not fun when it’s pouring down raining, cold, or too hot. The faster I got things done the more I’ll be able to rest until it starts getting busy again. Managers weren’t always fair but my last manager was awesome.

Overall,Walmart is and can be a great company to work from. It starts with management. Poor management can spoil a day for its associates. I loved my job and would still be there had I not been mistreated. Within two years I was promoted twice. If I had known my manager was under investigation and would be demoted and moved to another store I would still be there. I enjoyed working with others and they enjoyed working with me.,4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Albany, GA",4/9/18,2018,4,9

Good company if you like retail,"Honestly, Walmart is a great company to work for but if you don't enjoy retail it will destroy you. A lot is expected of you if you work hard and nothing is expected if you don't causing a very difficult burden to carry on all but the least effective associates. Your experience with Walmart will be entirely determined by 2 things. Your feelings about the industry itself and the quality of your store management. If you work for a store with quality management and/or enjoy retail this is great. If either of those aren't true it's only acceptable. If neither are there it is a pretty tough haul.",4,Current Employee,Electronic Sales Associate ,"Johnson City, TN 37604",4/9/18,2018,4,9
Alright Place,"The job is pretty easy which is the best part, I had a pretty cool supervisor and manager as well. They did however, never try to solve work issues. I was also scolded by an HR rep after my manager had given me direction. The HR rep was giving me directions that conflicted with what my managers directions. Despite asking 4 times I also never got my direct deposit set up. The HR rep cared more about going home early so he would leave before the time we were supposed to meet. Despite being a new employee, I was left at my station alone 95% of the time with little direction. I would look for other tasks to do when mine were done, and my supervisor would have me just stand in the corner.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Bakery Associate ,"Citrus Heights, CA",4/8/18,2018,4,8

Dull and stressful environment.,Everyone I worked with was always tired and stressed due to the work environment. Hours were always changed without alerting you first. Management would do nothing but walk around and yell at associates. I went from part-time to full-time without being told or without any say in the matter.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Cashier ,"Bricktown, NJ",4/8/18,2018,4,8
Great company,"Wal-Mart logistics is a great company to work for. Great pay. Strong drive for safety. Always looking for ways to make work easier.

Understaffed and hard to get work finished,When you first start you must do pathways. Pathways are a training course you must do on the computer. It’s supposed to take you two months to do but they never gave me time so it took me 6 months to finish.  Until you finish you make a dollar less than everybody else. When I got to work I had to get a cart go to the front and get you returns. You put whatever is in your returns back on the shelves tell the truck is unloaded. When the truck is unloaded you go get freight. In between doing your work customers may ask you for help. You must stop what you’re doing and help them no matter how long it will take. You have a  certain time to get your freight done. After two hours you have to stop and zone your area. Zoning is bringing everything to the front of the shelf so no diamonds are showing. If these tasks don’t all get finished by the end of your shift you may get coached which is the same as a write up. You get one break in a four hour shift. If you work 8 hours though than you get an hour lunch. The hardest part is to get all your tasks done. I worked in toys so zoning it was impossible. Doing freight is hard because Walmart is always understaffed so you must help customers every five seconds. The best part of the job is the people you work with and the customers. I have made many friends that work there. It’s always nice to help a customer and being friendly. It makes their day go better and yours too.,3,Former Employee,TOYS ASSOCIATE ,"Chanute, KS",4/8/18,2018,4,8
Decent job with good pay,The pay is good the job is easy and love the people I work with. My only complaint is the poor management and dealing with some customers. The managers are always throwing each other under the bus which makes it really hard to do your job and please all the managers. They barley communicate with each other and take it out on the employees. Other than that the pay is great as well as your co-workers,4,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Haleyville, AL",4/8/18,2018,4,8
Some form of Job security but horrible work life balance,Largest retailer in the world that provides job security for hourly associates but not salaried management.  Constantly changing job discriptions and roles along with scheduling.  Ever rotating schedules for salaried management combined with expected 10+ hours each working day results in no healthy work life balance.  Family oriented indiividuals will not find this job to be desirable.  Single individuals with no outside of work life style would be most susceptible to this form of career.,2,Current Employee,Asset Protection Manager ,"North Little Rock, AR",4/8/18,2018,4,8

High volume fast paced,Walmart is not a bad place to work as long as you can physically keep up with what is expected of you.

It's a good job,"Comparable pay and benefits for the area and industry. Structured schedule and work objectives. Paid Time Off (PTO) in lieu of vacation holidays personal time, etc. PTO is accrued by hours worked and tenure. It is comparable to the ""paid vacation"" system. It is a quick paced warehouse environment and it is not for those not interested in work for pay. It is hard work for good pay. In my opinion, a young person with at least a Bachelor's Degree or intent on procuring one could make a very nice career there. An emphasis on Safety and Respect is part of the culture, as are random drug tests. It's a good job, but don't be mistaken. It is hard work.",5,Current Employee,Dry Shipping Loader ,"Pageland, SC",4/8/18,2018,4,8

"Great coworkers,but poor management.","Typical day at Wal-Mart as a Customer Service Supervisor was stressful. Management breathing down your neck about lines, and parking lot being a mess. Some Manager would help out but a majority would be in the office on cell phones claiming to work on schedules. Managers would stress out and take it out on their employees. Yelling over the radio, poor leadership. Customer Service supervisors would have to coordinate breaks and lunches, maintain parking with their cart pushers, and provide overrides for returns, sales, and financial services. Will be told to follow policy, but when a customer would ask for a manager the manager would sometimes send a support manager who didn't know the policy and have them override a return, or they will come out themselves (rarely happened) and instead of deal with the customer would just make the CSM look like a fool and tell them to take care of it. also have to deal with poor equipment, constantly breaking and waiting for days for Cooperate to approve to fix things.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Palm Desert, CA",4/7/18,2018,4,7

Easy work Good pay,Easy work and good pay but moving up in the company is impossible and you are just a number to them. They will fire you for the smallest of things but its not the managers just the company,4,Former Employee,cashier ,"Kingwood, WV",4/7/18,2018,4,7
Not the best place to work but decent pay,The issue with the problem at the Walmart I worked was the management. It was very disorganized and lazy. The store is a disaster and the back room is so much worse.,2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Avon, OH",4/7/18,2018,4,7
No stress and good people to work with,"Most of the time you work the hours that are requested for you and off days are not optional. You get two 10 minutes paid break and 30 minutes lunch on 8 hours shift. Everyone is treated equal regardless of culture, age, skin color or natural origin. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes managers are not good at training new employees and it's hard to learn things fast and they expect you to know everything. Rather than that it's fun and nice environment to work at.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Saint Paul, MN",4/7/18,2018,4,7
Dependent on the store you work at,"I had a poor experience in the store I worked at, but it really depends on the location and who your managers are. For me, I had issues going on in the department I was working at and despite speaking to two different co-managers, they hadn't done anything about it within the last three months I worked there. I enjoyed the position I worked in, but the more pressing issues made it hard to work out there without stress, and it had gotten to a point where I couldn't handle it anymore. _x000D_Regardless of the poor management, the work isn't hard at all - probably the easiest job I've had in my working career - just very tedious and takes time. _x000D_It's a good place to work if you're social and are a hard-worker, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend working at this specific location.",2,Former Employee,Garden Center Associate ,"Post Falls, ID",4/7/18,2018,4,7
You will tend to find yourself working harder then others.,A day at Walmart can be very hectic and fast paced. I learned how to unload and organize large amounts of freight and learned how to use a meat  slicer. Management can be iffy some can be great and other could care less. The hardest part of the job was trying to take over for a manager that left and having the pressure put on me by other management while being paid the same as everyone else. In any position if you work hard you will find yourself working harder then others around you and next to never getting in trouble for it even it its brought up. They do work great with any schedule/hours you need.,4,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Marquette, MI",4/7/18,2018,4,7

Worst Place I have worked at,"Walmart does not care about their employees, they do not care about their customers, all the managers are concerned with is getting their bonus every month, If they have to cut your hours in order to receive a bonus they will, they do not accept medical excuses, they are inconsiderate to those with kids. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WALMART TO ANYBODY",1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Summerville, SC",4/7/18,2018,4,7
Best place to work,Very flexible and will work with whatever situation you are in. Most positions can be either day or night. Fast-paced and easy to get promoted. Also they give you breaks,5,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Plainwell, MI",4/7/18,2018,4,7
hard place to work,I had different positions over the years with this company. As a department manager I had to order merchandise. As a stocker I stocked the merchandise on the shelves. I unloaded trucks and worked in the backroom. Customer service was always a part of each position.,2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Chandler, AZ",4/7/18,2018,4,7

fast paced job,"Pros_x000D__x000D_The insurance is good. I know I make more money than some of my peers. I feel like its job security because so many people shop there. No matter how bad the economy gets, consumers are still going to need to buy groceries so I also feel like its a good choice to stay stable in uncertain times._x000D__x000D_Cons_x000D__x000D_Wal-Mart's attendance policy leaves things to be desired. I understand that people shouldn't call in all the time.

I have a write up on my record that i was given for missing a total of six days in a twelve month period.",5,Former Employee,Walmart Supercenter ,"Florence, KY",4/7/18,2018,4,7
Its Work,The store I worked for was fairly successful. (ie busy/profitable)_x000D_they were very interested in promoting workers to low level management as soon as possible. unfortunately they management level tended to be unskilled and lazy or overworked as they tried to cover for unfilled positions and there own duties alike.,3,Former Employee,Dairy Associate ,"Mansfield, OH",4/7/18,2018,4,7
Hard work and fast paced environment but good,I love working for Walmart.  It’s been a great experience for me.  I love the pay rate at Walmart and the benefits are pretty good.  _x000D_ It’s a fast paced environment in the pharmacy but I really like it there.  _x000D_The one thing I don’t like is the hours I’ve been given.  It’s too late to spend time with my family most days when I  get home in the evening.,5,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Duncan, OK",4/7/18,2018,4,7
"Fast Paced environment, with room for advancement.","I started there as a cashier, and everyone was so nice to me. The job was fun, the customers were friendly. It was very easy to work there. The hours are great if you are looking for a part time job, but you do get in trouble if you go over your part time hours._x000D_They actually make you take extra time on your lunch to make up for the hours they would have paid you._x000D_Most of the managers are great, however some of the managers seem like they're not sure what they're doing._x000D__x000D_I later moved to the jewelry and apparel departments. I personally liked it much better than the cashier position. I was able to move around a lot more, and i could organize and stock things.

Workplace was dreadful but consistant,"My typical day at work was clocking in and waiting for a csm to tell me where to hop on a register. Once I get on a register I make sure I have receipt paper, a pen and any discount pallets with me so I can communicate with the customer about. Sometimes its not always like that especially on busy days. Your standing in one spot at the register all day and your checking groceries out. If its a slow day then your zoning the candy in the isles. Once it's close to clocking out, you have to clean your station, take out trash so that the next associate won't have to do any heavy work.",5,Former Employee,CASHIER ,"Manhattan, KS",4/7/18,2018,4,7

Variety of skills to learn and tasks to keep busy,A day in the Garden department varied from day to day along with time of day. I worked with a team inside the store and outside in the patio or lot. I enjoyed operating the forklift and scissor lift the most. I'm skilled at it but I prefer not to run the register. I would rather discuss ideas and product options with the customers on the floor. Management was decent at explaining the days tasks and projects but they won't babysit anyone through it all.,3,Former Employee,Lawn and Garden Sales Associate ,"Midlothian, VA",4/7/18,2018,4,7

Management is illogical,The workers work hard at Walmart PERIOD. There are some that are lazy and don't do anything but they will eventually get fired. Management tends to blame the lower workers for problems that they can't fix. That is probably the only issue I may come up with. Retail don't have fixed lunches so prepare to starve while you work at time to time.,4,Former Employee,Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Kansas City, MO",4/7/18,2018,4,7

Management,"A typical day at work consists of associates requests for days off, handling customer complaints, hiring, and cleanliness of the store.  Management seems to be too caught up in working freight than taking care of the big picture with training and learning the new programs.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to be home at a decent time for family.  Schedules flip flop from opening one day and closing the next.  The enjoyable part of the job is being able to help associates and customers and knowing that I did a great job doing it.",5,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Mesa, AZ",4/7/18,2018,4,7

"fast-paced, disorganized","Walmart for the most part is a great company, The hardest part is there is no execution on proper policies and procedures pertaining to the culture of the business.

"Fun, yet busy work environment.","Very fast paced and busy work environment, there was always work to do. It was a great job! But there was also absolutely no teamwork and very poor communication between the management team members, in the department that I had worked in. A lot of slacking and employees/managers disappearing during shifts(proof of not working during shifts with numerous employees on numerous occasions), it was a bit out of control. Genuinely the company can run better and smoother if everyone did/enforced their roles more effectively. It would be more sufficient if people actually followed rules and regulations, you would have more caring, devoted and longer lasting employees. It could also save money(between paying employees to train, hiring, firin, ect.) and be more in control and less hectic/crazy.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",4/7/18,2018,4,7

God forbid you have an opinion or think for yourself, theyll find any reason under the sun to fire you.

They set ridiculous unattainable goals and expect you to do it with no help.",2,Former Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Texarkana, TX",4/6/18,2018,4,6
"good coworkers, frustrating mangement, varried workplace",It really depends on the type of person you are when working here.

welcoming enviornment with room for change,"Definitely a place where growth is inevitable. In under a year I saw many people go from associates to managers.  A major plus is that if you are ever uncomfortable or ready for a different setting you can request a change of department and learn something new. The hardest part of this job is working with people. There are times where customers will come off as disrespectful and you have to train yourself not to retaliate. Also, my store has a very high percentage of people from other countries who speak foreign languages. Being bilingual would be really helpful in this particular setting.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Louisville, KY",4/6/18,2018,4,6

It was honestly an easy job as long as everyone showed up and focused on what they needed to do. I enjoyed working with everyone and built great relationships with majority of people.

Job is not interesting.,"It's a pretty boring job.  I feel more like a glorified cashier than a pharmacy tech.  My managers/pharmacists are great to work with but the managers that handle the rest of the store are pretty unapproachable and lifeless.  The hardest part of the job is remaining enthusiastic and approachable after dealing with the general public for hours at a time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is filling prescriptions, at least with that part I can just focus on the job at hand without general public interaction.",2,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Quincy, IL",4/6/18,2018,4,6
"Fast paced, decent pay, but stressful environment.","They start you off with the first six months where you can only call off four times, because they function on a point based absence system. While that sounds decent a no call/no show ends ip being worth four points and is therefore instant termination. Aside from that, any tardy, regardless of excused or not, counts as half a point, and points do not roll off annualy but six months from the date of the occurence. So it is a very stressful workplace, but the pay is decent, as you start at 9$/hour and after six months and the completion of your CBL’s you get a raise to 10$/hour but the only other raises you can get are yearly, at only 10% a year up to 15$ at most as an hourly associate.",3,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Virginia Beach, VA",4/6/18,2018,4,6

It was so/so.,"While I enjoyed most of the people there, and I personally never dealt with a difficult customer (not that nobody there hasn't), the management was poor, with people that didn't belong as managers. I had confirmation that one such manager only worked the job for a paycheck, and that kind of person is horrible for a company, and unsurprisingly, this particular manager wasn't liked by hardly anybody at the Wal-Mart I worked through.",3,Former Employee,CAP2 Associate ,"Chillicothe, OH",4/6/18,2018,4,6
Not bad while you work on something better,You spend most of the day helping customers find products while working on stocking and organization of products.  Your manager will likely give you something to work on then disappear for the rest of the day.

The policies on there benefits changes constantly, and usually the employees suffer but without consequences to WalMart. _x000D_For instance I worked third shift and when they decided to change the shift differential from $1.50 to .50, we had no recourse._x000D_Then they took away ALL holiday pat and you had to ""earn"" your personal time/vacation time/sick time. ALL were grouped in to what they called Paid Time Off._x000D_They also decided that EVERONE across the board, except management, would receive an annual increase of 2%, whether you worked hard or were a lazy oaf???

It was a lot of fun servicing customers and seeing smiles of satisfaction on their faces",4,Former Employee,Cashier and Salesperson ,"Wilson, NC",4/6/18,2018,4,6
Terrible,"Working here barely paid the bills. the management as a whole were cutthroat and would throw anyone under the bus for advancement, save for a very select few. The pay was low and the hours were inconsistent. They would give you enough hours to be full time but less that 40 so they, as it was put, can make sure you don't work over time. The company tells you how long it should take to put your freight away. a time build in a warehouse with no customers or management distracting them. If you don't meet your time because the management pulled you for something you would get in trouble. Only work here if you must (e.g. need cash till you get something better)",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Vancouver, WA",4/6/18,2018,4,6

Worst work experience of my life,"Walmart didn't care about their employees at all. Management would often change employees schedules hours before their shift and penalize them for not being their in time with no warning, to the point where almost the entire store staff printed out their schedules just to prove that they were there in time for their shift. _x000D__x000D_The managers didn't care at all about time off requests or anything outside of work, unsafe weather (massive blizzards) or working conditions and my experience was that they expected you to drop everything you were doing and come in on a moment's notice for a minimum wage job, and cared far more for their profits than anything else.",1,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Hilltown, PA",4/6/18,2018,4,6

Very productive,A typical day in my position at my store is about a 7 i guess on a scale of 1-10. We start off with a meeting sometimes then get straight to work. They lack an efficient hiring process for managers so i do 2 management positions at once. The management at my store is lack luster at best with managers not sharing the same ideas about how to move forward so you'll run into managers giving you different things to do than the next. No one is on the same page. They also lack the compassion for their associates and close to never show appreciation for their associates.,4,Current Employee,Support Manager ,"Union City, GA",4/6/18,2018,4,6
Its an okay job just nothing you can make a living on.,The work is easy it's just when they start pulling you in 100 different direction it gets stressful. I havnt been offered health insurance and the pto system is ridicules.,3,Current Employee,Walmart sales floor associate ,"Center, TX",4/6/18,2018,4,6
Excessively Stressful for minimal compensation,"The people who work at walmart are great. The issues are more focused on company policies. Managers are so inconsistent that you can expect to have a new manager literally every six months at a minimum. Every time you get a new manager they have different experience and qualifications and they all come with their own ideas about how things should be done. This is an issue because as soon as you have mastered the last managers routine you get a new one. This is also complicated by the fact that every single year at walmart there are new policies and procedures (CAP, Top Stock, Meat CAP, etc). So on top of manager shifts there are company wide shifts to deal with as well. _x000D__x000D_Absences can take up to a month to appear on your record, meaning you could check your absences on monday and have only a few, call in on tuesday, come back wednesday and check and you could have multiple absences. In a matter of days you can go from safe to in trouble. For this reason I would highly recommend keeping track of your own absences and disputing any discrepancies.",2,Former Employee,Inventory Management Specialist ,"Kalamazoo, MI",4/6/18,2018,4,6

Company that cares very little for its workers,"I have worked for walmart on two different occasions in different cities,and noticed a disturbing trend.This monster company with billions in sales annually gets on people for any overtime ,has hardly any health benefits,and doesn't pay enough to keep up with the cost of living.Worse yet,any mention about union causes panic amongst managers and causes them to look for any reason to terminate .This company treats people as if their expendable ,yet tries to say they pay enough for workers not to form unions.",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Waukesha, WI",4/6/18,2018,4,6

They had nothing for their Associates for them to enjoy.,"The workplace was like being a number, the management had no care about the employees. If we, the associates told them that we were unable to do something, like pulling freight, lifting a certain amount of weight. They really did not care. _x000D__x000D_For myself, I was responsible for the Men's & Boys Dept., which I took great pride in how my depts looked each day at the end of my shift. I had, for example, an associate that was supposed to keep both departments up on my days off, and when I would come back to work, it was like no one was working the days I had off. Both departments were destroyed, not to mention I was having an issue with my departments being sabotaged, and every time I would go to my assistant manager regarding the matter, along with showing her pictures of what was going on and also going to the upper management. No one would take any sort of action to take care of the situation, nor investigate it. Some managers would tell me there were no camera's to see the area's and to see if anyone was around the time I would tell them it was happening, and than an assistant dept manager which didn't even work in my department, tells me right in front of the store manager that there are cameras and she is the only one trained to see my department and to what is going on. Still, nothing was taken care of. They would all continually tell me I am the best at what I do, and they only wanted me in apparel due to the how good I was.

Great place to work with excellent managers,"I only intended to work full-time over the summer, but continued to work part-time for my fall semester while I was at school. I found that my managers there were really nice and appreciated the work I did, so I didn't want to leave. The shifts were 2-11pm, which weren't ideal, but that was really my only complaint about the job itself and that can't be changed since it is based on the times the trucks would arrive. My complaint about the store is that the backroom is entirely too small for that size of a Walmart and was never upgraded when the store was enlarged. This made our job much more difficult and I felt like it put a lot more stress on management, especially during the holiday season.",4,Former Employee,Cap team 2 ,"Hampstead, MD",4/5/18,2018,4,5

Upbeat position with great benefits; could change your perspective on retail,"I really like what I do. I like who I do it for. I like when I do it. I feel every member of my supervising management team functions on an empathetic, yet company-first based level. They are realistic, yet drive our team to succeed, sometimes in the grimmest of odds. Some days I literally do not know how we managed to accomplish the sheer volume of labor we have performed, but through planning and follow-up, we do this shift after shift, day after day, season after season, year after year. Our retail structure is fast-paced and results driven. I feel I am challenged daily to find innovative improvements that help me form new goals for myself and my team. With a focus on growth, and competition, Walmart at times may feel like an insecure company to work for. However, I feel the actual work that I do does make a difference for the company, my work family, and my community. That being said, I feel my opportunities to enjoy activities in my community, or with my family are diminished by scheduling nuances still lingering within the company. There is indeed a poor work/life balance associated with my position. In light of this, it is vitally important to have secure boundaries with one's work, and house the ability to leave work at the door when you leave. Regardless, if considering working for Walmart, I would definitely recommend giving it a go.

Typical Opinion,"I usually clock in and start covering everyone's breaks and lunches. Or I start cleaning areas that need a clean up such as Customer service desk, Money service desk, or a register in which I would be going on. I learned that the more you learn out of your position the more Management would want you to go on the more technical spot that you don't get paid for. The managers that I've had in the past and now have been excellent. Unfortunately, I have met some  other managers that don't follow certain policy and just play the finger game where they blame their associates for not doing their jobs and doing their own. Some expect unrealistic goals as a retail store of little amount of associates. Some associates are more Favorited then others. I worked to get where I am, but cannot go more above then what I already am because of lack of acknowledgement by some members of management. The Hardest thing of this job is the amount of customers with high expectations of the store being new and not having a lot of associates to work with. Leaving those who do work to be stressed out by the rude comments and awful community of people. For the most part the usually customers are respectful, but then there's a handful of them that are just head aches. Another thing is the hours you are given. Because of this customer first program, some associates are only able to maintain some hours as a full-time and not just a guarantee of 40 hours. Some part-time people want as little as 16 hours at least but could only get 5-8 hours in a week. It all really depends which Walmart you go to I guess.The - more...",4,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Carpentersville, IL",4/5/18,2018,4,5

Soul sucking,They will work you to the bone. Upper management would approve things that were against federal regulation when it came to returns. Walmart had to set in place their own regulations due to employees being over worked such as being locked out of a system if you have been clocked in too long without an unpaid break.

Quick paced work place.,"First day on the job I was immediately thrown into a trailer with a guy who was explaining the job very poorly to me and another associate. it wasn't until my second week there (3rd day on the dock floor) I was given a new associate to work with, and he did a whole lot better of a job explaining what to do. The management is terrible, it took me 3 weeks until I got my own login info and when I did, it didn't work for me so I had to wait another day to receive my documents explaining how to set up my work profile. Honestly, the only enjoyable part of the job is working and talking to the associates who have been there longer than I have. Now, the worst thing about this place is that I was hired on with another associate at the same time, and went through training together, and yet he was able to get his login info and is now being trained on heavy machinery and ready to be working on his own. I have yet to get confirmation on when my training on the lift is.",3,Current Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Sutherland, VA",4/5/18,2018,4,5

Management is stern but still easy to get along with and will definitely recognize outstanding job performance. There are quarterly bonuses given when the store as a whole meet certain company goals and also associates receive special lunches. The company offers a in store computer based learning program that will give you the tools you need to learn all areas and requirements of your position.

I get a lot of hours for being part time and the pay is really good. Management is really understanding and they offer 3 days of bereavement when you lose a loved one which is extremely nice. I live in a college town and it seems that students tend to cause a bit of work place drama and Walmart seems to have the least work place drama out of anywhere I have ever worked which is amazing. The only issue we have is an older manager who forgets things a lot when you need any help or if you need change.

They even ""lost"" our equipment and claimed it as stolen until I recieved a work related injury and then they miraculously found it within a minute.

Family for Life,"While I worked at a smaller Neighborhood Market location, I can honestly say, I had some of the best times working for Walmart. Working in the pharmacy, I dealt with customers, local doctors offices and insurance companies, so it is definitely a fast paced environment. Everyone gets annual raises on your anniversary date, and quarterly bonus depending on store sales and reviews. They offer 401k and stock options, and they do match up to 5-6% of the 401k. Even though they are improving the wages for employees, it could still be better. If they added more full time positions, I probably would have stayed, but it seems like they want more part timers so they do not have to pay for too many benefits",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"New Bern, NC",4/4/18,2018,4,4

I really liked working at Walmart,"Walmart was a great place to work. Management was very helpful with everything. My managers would jump on the registers and help if there were long lines. Walmart treated their employees great. I got paid well and the work was easy. I was always asked to pick up extra hours which was great for me because I needed it. You get plenty of breaks, and there is a ridiculous number of times you are allowed to call in. _x000D__x000D_You really have to be a people person to work at Walmart. Walmart has some of the BEST and some of the WORST customers. People will yell at the cashiers if a coupon doesn't work. You have to have thick skin to be a cashier. A customer's pillow fell off the conveyor belt once and she told her husband I threw her pillow on the ground! You really have to stand your ground and be professional when dealing with distraught customers. Many people don't last long in that position. _x000D__x000D_Despite the occasional rude customers, I really enjoyed my job. I was allowed to pick up extra shifts, management was cool, and I met some really great customers. The day goes by fast when its busy._x000D__x000D_The discount is pretty pathetic though.

Welcome To the Wonderful World of Wallie,"I started at Wal-Mart almost 7 years ago.  Our first day on the job was suppose to be our orientation day.  It was about 100 or so employees that arrived that day.  The store was completely empty, only the floor shined brightly in the building.  Our orientation day turned out to be our building day.  The employees and I put every shelf together.  We stuck every sticker on each shelf.  We built and put together for about 2 months.  Finally, on a beautiful day in January 2011, we opened.  I felt so proud to be a part of such a wonderful experience.  Every day wasn't easy, but it was definitely worth it.  I enjoyed my position as a Certified Pharmacy Technician.  I enjoyed forming relationships with our patients and doing my best for them.  The workplace culture was blended and management, in both pharmacy and the store were awesome.  I have learned so much from Wal-Mart.  The hardest part of my job will be leaving after being there for so long.  I want to grow with a company. I do not job hop.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and working with wonderful people.  Although I have decided to leave Wal-Mart, it is not a reflection of my feelings for them.

"Fun, and Fast","Wal-mart was a great place to work, Again very fast and quite challenging at first, the employees were for the most part very friendly and the customers were as well. You would get an irate customer every now and then but its the nature of the beast at big box stores. the managers seemed to care a great deal about the employees under them, as well as the customers, and were always striving to make the workplace better. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was keeping up when the store was really busy (i.e holidays, sales events etc.) I still kept up but it was definitely a challenge. All in all I really enjoyed my experience there.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Oldsmar, FL",4/4/18,2018,4,4
Overall a good place to work,The culture at Walmart is phenomenal.  When they say Respect for the Individual is a core value they mean it.   _x000D_Agreement is usually reached through consensus instead of directives. _x000D_The job security has been a little shaky the past three years.

To Each Their Own,"Everyone person will have their own experience working at Walmart. Some people will love it and some will simply loath it. I was somewhere slightly past the middle, leaning toward loathing but this was mostly due to co-workers and not the company itself. If you greet customers in a friendly manner and maintain professionalism then you generally will have a healthy work experience. Some managers were just as involved with day to to day functions as the floor employees, where as others were very expectant of good results but not really good at giving direction. The hardest part of the job was dealing with disgruntled customers and the most enjoyable part was the company discount.",3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Thomaston, GA",4/4/18,2018,4,4

Walmart,"The Walmarts I worked at were ok. It was sufficient to have as a job while in graduate school. We did have one customer service manager who took her job too seriously and jumped on cashiers unfairly. It was like she was looking for reasons to fuss at someone. I didn't have my cellphone out, showed up on time, was efficient, courteous and friendly to customers. She reprimanded me twice and then discovered she was in error for giving me a hard time. She did this to other employees under her and treated us like we were guilty until proven otherwise.

Very Poor,"As a salary member of management you have to work all the time. If your store manager wants you to work 7 days with no off days, you have to work this schedule. The hours are terrible and this is not a great place to be if you have family or ever want to see them. The Hourly associates get paid less but treated better. If you want to be a manager you can be a department manager or a Support because they are hourly managers but can only work 40 hours a week and your guaranteed to get your off days.",1,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Fayetteville, GA",4/4/18,2018,4,4

my day,"A typical day at work, I would go on in and clock in 8 hrs on cash register, every day i would learn something new, if not for work, it would be a customer that would teach me.

I missed to many days because my pregnancy was high risk and had complications. My daughter's now one and healthy thank the Lord. I think it depends on which Walmart you work for.

Pretty decent place to work,"I enjoyed working the job and the environment but i did not get a long with what i thought was lazy management, the reason i ended up leaving was because the manager basically acted as a “road crew manager” where they would barely do anything or barely help and stack work on already swamped workers",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Jacksonville, IL",4/3/18,2018,4,3

A good place to grow.,"I have worked on and off for the company for almost 17 years in total. Though it is a place to grow, unless you are willing to devote your whole life to them, things can become less tenable with time. My typical day begins with opening duties including printing and verifying sales reports, calling patients to confirm appointments (on days preceding our doctor coverage) scheduling my associates and setting up the register. I have earned many things during my tenure about customer service as well as gained a vast knowledge of precription eye wear and troubleshooting issues for patients. I believe the stores are only as good as the person at the helm, some of which are inspiring, while others are not.

When finished with that, I would check and see what slicer needed to be cleaned, break down that slicer and clean it.  My manager would come by often to check on us and see if we needed anything.

It was great.,Working work was one of my great experience. I took the time to leaner all the department because I was interested in all what Walmart have for me.

More difficult than it needed to be.,"I found the work to be fine, however Walmart was very against working with my college school schedule.

"Poorly Managed, Underpaying, Stressful","The Walmart I had the unfortunate task of working at, was one of the most poorly managed I have ever seen. General manager was never on premises, the hours scheduled were ridiculous, including the regular practice of putting gaps between shifts of 2-5 hours, refusing to schedule associates who used public transportation accordingly, and overall just treating associates like disposable pawns. The break room has no ventilation or temperature control, so good luck if someone uses the attached employee restrooms. Management, with a few exceptions, don't care about their employees, just so long as there isn't a problem they need to handle.Additionally, as a Customer Host, you are required to acquire a NYS Security Guard License...then told you literally cannot do a single thing you were just taught to do in the 22 hours of classes they force you to take.

And sometimes I worked 6 hours with out being able to go to the bathroom.  Put in my two week notice because of the stress. Got the flu during  the two weeks and had to call out a couple days.

When The Little Things Pile Up,"A typical day at Wal-mart was not particularly exciting or much to write home about, a few sales here and there, maybe one or two problems outside of the protocol that required some critical thought, a bit of cleaning and you're on your way. The little things that pile up though are what really drove me to transfer my department and see the bigger picture outside of my little cash register. The issues being the store has an obsession with constantly changing something. No matter how nonsense, no matter how many layers you have to dig through to find the purpose to it all, not matter how it affect the bottom line or customer satisfaction things will change for better or often for a little Wal-mart in an older community like mine, for the worse.The desire to modernize in an older community has driven a lot of our customer base away and the constant changes to department protocol and what we can and can't do, or simply things you aren't told you can and can't do, made working on the front end a hassle and now that the store has done its due diligence in driving away as many cashiers as it possibly could it struggles to keep their lines down and their customers happy. And for what? A new department customers are going to be reticent to use because they value the interaction with a cashier and driving away valuable employees through consolidating departments and constant iteration on a formula that worked. I learned a lot in my time working at Wal-mart, enough to know just how badly corporate ideas that have to be implemented at every store for better and worse, can really turn what - more...",3,Current Employee,Wireless Sales Associate ,"Saint Johns, MI",4/2/18,2018,4,2

The BEST manger I ever had quit after 6 months and he was AWESOME! He made work fun he encouraged us. But the other management didn’t like him so they forced him out. But the truth is you may apply for one job but once it’s all said and done you end up working the whole store. My store was ALWAYS short handed. Didn’t allow over time.

stressful and managers do not help in these situations,Go in unload the truck without help. When help is needed managers just slide boxes down the line and then text on there phones.

Don't work here,"Asking for specific days off is a waste of time. I was moved to another department so someone could transfer from another store. I was moved to one department on paper so I could keep my 7.50 an hour. In reality, I was working in a department that I was not trained for. After a few days of being moved to my new department, I was working in multiple departments a day. Often times, I was yelled at because one manager forget to tell the other manager that they had moved me. The work is not worth the pay.

Great customers and many hard working employees but terrible management.,"We are always being told how our store is different than any other one. No customer service, not enough employees on the floor, management is rude and doesn't care about customer satisfaction. We don't even have bathrooms most of the time, and the store smells and isn't clean. Customers complain to management, then to the home office, the health department, and even on Facebook and Twitter. Some have called radio and TV stations to complain, but nothing happens. Several employees have reported to the ethics office of Walmart but again nothing changes. Maybe it's just our store but it's hard to support these conditions.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Corsicana, TX",3/30/18,2018,3,30

I like the aspect of the company where it seems pretty solid and it is stable income.  I do not like the management team collectively and how things are so competitive and retaliation, although against policy, runs rampant with the management team as a whole.  The store I work in does not like to train people.  What I know I've had to learn on my own.  A typical work day is attempting to follow company policies and the routine, but nothing is ever routine there.  Things change moment to moment.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management team. Often the management team is not trained and each one has a different agenda.

Relaxed work environment with a lot of shortcomings,The job was pretty easy and strait forward. The management there liked to play favorites and since they liked me my job was very relaxed. I got to work at my own pace without too much input from management. The best part of the job was we could listen to music and did not follow the dress code since there were no customers in the store when we worked. The hardest part of the job was Christmas time because there was more merchandise to move. Morale was typically low among the employees due to it being a retail overnight position. I did learn the importance of being on good terms with your managers due my job being more relaxed because of it. I also learned a lot about how inventory moves throughout the store.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Martinez, CA",3/29/18,2018,3,29

Good place to start,"I cant actually give too much detail because I'm still currently employed by Walmart but for the most part it can be a reasonably good place to work, but Walmart doesn't hire anyone on full-time unless the position demands it which unless its a management position of any level or if the job code allows it. From my experience the company is for the most part fair and usually works with you on your availability if they can and they focus on building up their associates who show interest or potential. If you don't want to advance and just kinda wanna be there and you work but you are just there get a paycheck you can but not usually where you would like to work. Most of the departments in the Super Centers require you to be engaged with the customers and fellow associates, and you are constantly stocking and zoning(organizing the merchandise towards the front of the shelf), this allows the customer easy access and keeps the departments in neat and clean form. The hardest part of the job is the semi-constant change in procedures and sometimes policies, which Walmart does to improve the company as a whole which in my opinion(and many others) isn't always the case.",4,Current Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Mebane, NC",3/29/18,2018,3,29

bad management with little care for employees,"Made $7.50 an hour got one raise to $7.90 an hour, the management was out for themselves and cared little for the employees. I tried changing my schedule to accommodate my joint custody I had with my daughter so I could get weekends off since I had her on weekends. My answer was a no in capital letters. The management didn't care whether you had family they just cared about you working and their production. I enjoyed customer interactions and it built up my speaking and sales abilities. There were no benefits and got no paid leave whether it was vacation, sick, or accrued leave. Bottom line, they work you like a dog and could care less about you as their employee, there was no room for advancement and they seemed to always be short staffed. They always have backed up registers due to poor scheduling. They had up to 20 registers but only 3 would be open. Will not work for Walmart again.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Boaz, AL 35957",3/29/18,2018,3,29

However, when I started working here over a year ago, I was amazed at how pleasant and supportive the work experience has been. Sure the pay is the highest but it also is totally sufficient for me to live a quality lifestyle where I live. The Health Benefits aren't as robust as other companies at which I've worked.

"Decent pay and benefits IF you're fulltime, but you still get jerked around","Walmart is constantly playing the 'more work, less people' game and it visibly affects the store's performance and customer service abilities. They are consistently adding in new 'red tape' hoops to jump through, while cutting hours and department coverage. We are constantly being told to ""work smarter, not harder"", but none of our equipment works correctly or has been updated properly to manage the workflow effectively. They do not focus on what good you bring to the company, or how hard you actually work to get things done. They only focus on what hasn't been completed, while not taking into account the various reasons those tasks may not have been possible to complete. It's literally all about the numbers on paper, and not the actual functionality of the workplace or how different factors affect those numbers. We are expected to function like machines, not people. Discussions are never about how to improve things to more effectively reach company goals. Discussions are only about how goals aren't being met, and how you aren't working hard enough, even as you're killing yourself to keep their company running. Basically, the company is being micro-managed to death by pencil-pushers and number-crunchers that have no idea what it actually takes to do the jobs that need to be done to keep the company running efficiently, and they don't care about anyone.

Walmart,Walmart is one of the top hiring employer in the country. The standard interview and orientation system of Walmart is fair. But employees such as myself  lack training and guidance on the sales floor. The employee definitely needs to be a fast learner and adjust to new procedures quickly.

I learned and mastered working/assisting in the area I was assigned and established trust and dependability with the supervisors/management team.

Walmart,Understaffed very much.  Stressful due to additional pressure being placed on management to compensate for understanding.  Corporate initiated a program raising beginning employees wage to $11 per hour but did not give raises to existing employees.  Narrowed the wage gap between management and associates.  This created or at least added to a critical morale problem.,3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Marble Falls, TX",3/25/18,2018,3,25

About as much concern for issues as a cat,"In the year I have worked for Walmart management has been slow to fix issues, will work you to death to accomplish the tasks of multiple associates and shows a great deal of favoritism for specific employees. Things that would instantly get you fired in other environments (stealing, threatening other associates, bullying) is largely ignored. When such issues cause greater issues the management team acts surprised or tells you to calm down even if you have informed them of the issue repeatedly prior to it becoming a greater issues. The work is made more difficult due to a lack of proper equipment and often multiple departments competing over the only equipment available. My advice? Don't work for Walmart",1,Current Employee,Cake Decorator/Baker ,"Westminster, CO",3/25/18,2018,3,25

It was a lot of fun,"It was a start-up.  I watched it come out of the dirt.  I stood inside of it while other parts of the roof were being installed and others slabs of concrete were being poured.  I interviewed the managers that would report to me and designed and created SOPs.  It was a new division of Wal-Mart which was why it was so fun.  It gave me a lot of free reign.  Cookie-cutter environments are more stressful to me.  I really enjoyed speaking to 400 people at 6am in the morning.  I really enjoyed the morning meetings with my managers.  I had over a dozen mentees although I was only required to have two.

Over all the company is good.,The Walmart I work at dose not have good management. The schedule is not done correctly and I often work the job of more than one person. Even after reporting a co-worker for Mean and discriminate comments nothing was done. It is very hard to get full time hours and benefits. For a part time employee there is little to no benefits availability. Breaks are never timed right. Even if you ask not to work certain hours you are not listened to.,5,Current Employee,Deli Clerk ,"Pantego, TX",3/25/18,2018,3,25

Management is very lacking.,"- Not every Walmart is the same. I just had the misfortune of being hired on at this location. All levels of management are very aware of how to boss you around, but have no clue of what it takes to get the job done. Never expect them to work with you on anything, just expect commands with little direction. Hard work is very seldom noticed. You have associates that show up to work intoxicated and receive more praise than you. It is a very biased community and unless you know the right people, good luck._x000D__x000D_- The paid time off is an absolute joke, especially if you are just starting out as a part-time associate. You accrue roughly an hour per paycheck just starting out. So it will take you roughly 40 paychecks to save up for a week off._x000D__x000D_- Do not expect to get bumped into full time unless you are friends with the right people._x000D__x000D_- It is a very cut-throat community with plenty of gossiping and backstabbing to go around.

It's a good place to work if you don't mind working yourself to death while others stand around and do nothing.,"Management are either complacent or powerless to do anything about poor performance from associates.

Depending on management work experience is positive,From working at different stores at Walmart I have found out it having a dedicated and caring management team makes or breaks the store.

For the most part my time at Walmart was a positive experience and I would recommend working at certain locations.,4,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician II ,"Edmond, OK",3/24/18,2018,3,24
A night shift perspective,"A typical night at walmart was met with receiving our tasks for the night then being told how slow and horrible we were at them.

Management,"I would come in and stock from the top racks on isles for the 1st hour to try to fill in empty spaces of product then around 5 would start unloading the merchandise truck while organizing different department products by their respective number. After that was done we would seperate mixed pallets of freight and seperate apparel by their respective department or aisle while others would stock consumable freight that had been recieved on the truck until after 7. If the grocery side truck has come then I or someone would unload it with an electrical pallet jack and then downstack the pallets and stock until lunch. Afterwards we would either take the remaining freight inside the backroom to the floor and/or stock. The environment with coworkers was generally friendly most of the time. Some managers were also either really approachable about anything or would just never listen to what you had to say so communication was very difficult at times. Hardest part was probably trying to finish the truck at a reasonable time depending on how it was stacked from the warehouse and sometimes it was the most enjoyable part of the day depending on how everyone's moods were and how willing people were to be in a friendly enviroment. I learned how to operate an electrical pallet jack, a walkie stacker, and how to drive a forklift as well as operate handhelp terminals for binning and pulling out product from bins with also making inventory labels and varifying high end merchendise to show we had recieved the product.

not a good job,"In my experience, Walmart was not a very good place to work for. For example, the reason why I was fired was because of points. You can have up to 4 points for the first six months and they come off exactly 6 months after you get them. They give points for if you're late, and if you don't come at all. You get 1 point if you're more than 2 hours late and you get a half a point if you're less than 2 hours late. Well, I came to work one morning and I started my day as usual. I was the opening so I had to get my till. And then it dawned on me that I forgot to clock in. It was 7:11am. They give you the first 9 minutes for free...just to give a little leeway. Anyway, I clocked in and when I went to clock out, I checked on the computer if I had gotten an extra half point for that morning which would have put me at 4.0 points. I didn't have one. So, I thought to myself, okay, they didn't put it in because they saw me there at work. Well, a couple weeks later, I checked on the computer again and it was on there that i had 4.0 points!!!! Every time I would try to go to the people that were supposed to fix it, they either weren't there or they were at lunch. And they almost never answer the phone; I called 3 times. The managers eventually caught on to it and they fired me, despite my story that I explained to them. I went to the manager about a week after I was fired and explained to him my situation and he said ""okay, I'll take a look at it."" but that never happened. So that's why I wouldn't recommend this company to ANYONE.",2,Former Employee,Self Checkout Host/cashier ,"South Hill, VA",3/21/18,2018,3,21

Thankful for all the hours but was exhausting and gave me no extra time before or after work to do anything. They did offer insurance though and vision, stock options and 401k. I took the 401k option because I try to always do that when I can at a job so I can save up money for my future. I cleaned bathrooms and took out trash and had to do a lot of nasty things as a maintenance worker but it was good pay and good hours and I always kept a positive attitude and did my best to keep the store clean and help customers and associates where I could so customers would have a good clean desirable experience at our store and want to come back again and again.",5,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Kitty Hawk, NC",3/20/18,2018,3,20

Great place to meet long lasting friends and make steady/stable income.,"A typical day at work consists of serving customers needs. Whether it's helping with a carry out to their car. Or helping them leave quickly through bagging and scanning grocery items at the register. What's great about being a cashier at Walmart is that you're able to meet characters from all walks of life. You even get to see a regulars coming in if he/she enjoys your service. The workplace culture is pretty much routine. You get a chance to build longlasting friendships at the job. The hardest part of the job would say getting someone to cover you whether it's at the register or outside as a cart attendant when it's time for your break. It's not necessarily a ""bad thing"" because the flow of customers means that the business and company is booming well. Everyone is human and needs a break so even getting a hold of the manager to get someone to cover for you is difficult because he or she is being requested by customers left and right. Regardless, Walmart is a great place. At the end of the day, whether you're a manager or cashier or cart attendant everyone has their hands full equally.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Cart Attendant ,"Garden Grove, CA",3/20/18,2018,3,20

Stressful and low pay. Who wants that?,"I've been with Walmart 8 long, hard years. In order to ""Save Money so you can Live Better"", Walmart has to cut their costs somewhere, labor is a big one. As a result, it's NORMAL that salaried managers expect what is humanly impossible and then the associate is in trouble if he/she can't meet the expectation. In addition, some of our stores support aggressive, condescending management as a way to inspire. That is not within my moral code and I cannot work there any longer.",1,Current Employee,Personnel Coordinator ,WA,3/19/18,2018,3,19
"no affordable benefits, overworked, very few raises","very little pay, very little hours, i made lifelong friends out of my fellow employees but management had no problem cheating, lying, or doing whatever else they needed to do get your compliance. very few people got more than 25 hours, the schedule changed every week, which was chaotic to plan around and didn't allow you to have anything approaching a life.

Average,"Working at Walmart provided me with much needed work experience. However, I would not consider it to be a career worth pursuing, unless you are aimed high on the corporate ladder. It's good for those individuals with no prior work experience, as having something on your future applications is leagues better than having nothing at all.

Busy and overwhelming place to work,"Though I thoroughly enjoyed the compensation, the management and CSMs at Walmart are unhelpful and take unnecessarily long amounts of time to help its other employees. Dealing with rude customers is one thing, but long wait times to receive help with a transaction is tiresome. Most of the other employees are nice, but some get irritated for no reason. The breaks are short and having to wait for other cashiers to get back from their breaks is frustrating when they extend their break by 5-10 minutes.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Greenfield, IN",3/19/18,2018,3,19

Challenging and Rewarding,A typical day with Walmart will begin with touring the store and communication management on previous shift. Continuing executing goals for sales and associate engagement. During the day work to resolve customer and associate concerns. Also following up with associates to ensure task are completed during shift.  Engage with personnel to interview potential associates to satisfy any shift needs for staffing as well as coaching associates on performance concerns.

Poor Management,"The department management was always hard working and supportive of employees. But the higher you look up the long chain of management at Walmart, the less they seem to do. If the managers know you by name they'll volunteer you to do jobs aside from your own department while they do seemingly nothing.

Competitive/high paced but poor management,"They go on about how management is always trying to improve and help and they'll listen/hear you out... however! they'll never implement anything because it's the whole ""why fix what's not broken."" because in their opinion everything is fine and it works but that's because the staff is able to find their own work-arounds to make it work. Not like they would know anyways, most of them are never on the floor._x000D__x000D_Overall I had some good departments and bad departments as we all do. The work isn't too terribly hard but you need to go in knowing that you're in for some hard labor. It's basically like having a gym membership and getting paid to work-out (depending on the position of course). They give incentives depending on how fast your production speeds are and you have to uphold it because they average your productions for the whole pay period (NOT JUST THAT DAY/WEEK). the pay period._x000D__x000D_If you work the weekend shift be ready to not have a lunch.

Not as Flexible as it should be,"Shifts and, hours and pay not as flexible as it should be.  Shifts and pay should be according to how long and how well you have worked there. when minimum wage was raised everyone's pay should have increased accordingly and it did not.  I have worked there over 9 years and because of the minimum wage increase I barely make over that.  Not fair for how long and hard I have worked there.

Walmart is a corrosive capitalistic nightmare,"The pay is not nearly enough for how constricting the job environment is.

"Stressful, dead end place to work.","There were a few wonderful people working with me at Walmart,but most of the upper management team simply did not care. Walmart as a company does not care. They do things that make it look like they do, but the only thing on their minds is money. Managers are not allowed enough shift hours to make it even somewhat easy on the employees. Departments are consistently understaffed. A lack of workers, however, does not change their idea of how the store should look or be running. I was often in charge of three or four departments on my own, and i know the same was expected of many others. Walmart decisions, as a whole, are ridiculous and often end up making things harder instead of easier. This job was much harder than it should be and while the pay is decent, I did not feel like it was enough money to justify the way employees get treated. Never before my Walmart job, did I take home anger and stress. Almost every day I came home in an awful mood due to the leadership and expectations i experienced at Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Hourly Associate ,"Warrenton, MO",3/18/18,2018,3,18

At times, it felt that management didn't care about the work or the employees. But management was prone to massive turnover as well.

They experiment and try to advance the company which is great but it costs people their jobs at times. Otherwise there are endless possibilities for growth and they pay their associates well.,4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"West Lafayette, IN",3/18/18,2018,3,18
Bad,Working at Walmart is like working as a slave basically at least at mine. They hardly ever have enough employee's there to do the job with out stress they make their cashier's do anything and everything if they're short staffed else where because they didn't schedule anybody. And the manager where I work basically told mey job is more important than my child.,1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Cambridge, OH 43725",3/18/18,2018,3,18
A nice friendly place to work,"Busy days at work. I learned to be a better Cashier, with retail, not just grocery. Management was very good to the workers.

overall about walmart,The hardest part about working at Walmart is knowing that all the managers aren't on one page.Self checkout never runs smoothly.Its hard to talk to a manager about a problem your having.

Very stressful cutting hours all the time,Always had to work outside of my job code was held accountable for things that were not my responsibility. I was an hourly and had to cut my hours but was held to the responsible of a assistant manager. I never got my breaks and was told to take short lunches then got in trouble for it. It was not all bad the associates were great had a good repore with them. I always put them first. The customers were great also. I felt sorry for them because the store was not staffed for them because of the hours getting cut so drastically. This is because of managements lack of skills,3,Current Employee,Personal/hourly assistant manager ,"West Palm Beach, FL",3/18/18,2018,3,18

Terrible company to work for,"Walmart is exactly what you would expect, the only redeeming quality from working there was the pay. After the public outcry of how low the pay was the company increased the minimum wage for all workers. That definitely did not make anything better. Managers would expect you to do the work of 3-5 people by yourself without offering any help, certain managers had no idea what they were doing and other managers acted like children just because they were in a position of power. Management definitely played favorites and if you weren’t “in” then good luck trying to be treated decently by any of them. The only other good experience I had here was meeting some good freinds through coworkers, we were all united in how much we hated the place",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Smyrna, TN",3/18/18,2018,3,18
"Much to do, if you can find the people to work it.","Not as easy as some would think. The work is constant, yet never enough people to work it.

Bad place to work,Walmart is a bad company to work for because they do not appreciate their workers.  They don't answer your questions about situations and they don't really help the customers.  The management team is not professional at all because all they do is sit in the afternoon office and eat or just do cbls so they don't have to be on the sales floor helping customers.  They also never have enough help on the front end checking out customers and they will fire you without ever talking to you about anything or you ever being coached.

Chaotic work environment,"A decision to classify the majority of employees as ""managers"" if they are involved with an area of the store is very misleading and makes it difficult to tell who is actually in charge or has authority over a project until you get to know everyone, if even then.

Depends on the Store manager,"My direct supervisor or Asset protection manager was awesome. but the actual store manager was completely oblivious to what went on with the security side of the things.

A wonderful place to work. The job opportunities are unlimited!,"A typical day is customer service, customer and some more customer service. I will miss my customers and my fellow employees. I learned about Walmart's concern for the safety of employees and customers. They are a caring company. In most cases, management is friendly and caring. The workplace culture is the customer comes first.

(Store in Hays, Kansas) They don't care about employees well-being and don't want you to grow with the company. I'm a college student so I didn't have any intentions to grow with them, but it's still sad to see others wanting to climb up the corporate ladder only to stay as a part-time employee for years. As a temporary job, Walmart would be one that I could recommend, but don't expect to be treated with the respect that you deserve here.

Poorly managed workplace with no real benefits or reasons for staying,"Management is unwilling or unable to communicate with the employees. Time off requests are approved based on favoritism, there is no room for advancement within the company (even if you get promoted, they force you to work at a different store without any say in where you go, so you get booted to the bad stores that have all of the open positions) and I worked for the company for almost 3 years without any real pay raise. All they ever do is raise the starting pay. I make as much money and get as much time off as someone who joins on tomorrow even though I've been loyal to the company for a few years now. Corporate decisions are questionable at best, and the incredibly high turnover rate (hovering somewhere around 70% company-wide, it's at 118% at my store for the past year, meaning the store loses more employees than it gains) is a huge sign of trouble when most standard retail businesses are looking at a turnover rate of 10%-20%. Most of the employees leave within the first 2 months. By raising the minimum pay, the company has done little more than require more of an investment for training, meaning there is no standing impact on the turnover rate but the company loses more money on the employees turning over (the company pays for all of their training and before the employees can even hit the floor and start working alone, they quit.) These very bad business decisions get thrown out one after the other, and the company seems to go by the idea of ""too big to fail.""

Fun but difficult,"Walmart was a vary interesting and fun place to work. I made a lot of friends while working there, got along with just about everyone. But management was an issue. they also did not care about personal issues you were having. You could be in the hospital and they would want you to come into work because they had a list of other people who called off. They would also want you to pick up double shifts. I had no problem with that, but working 9am- 9pm with only an hour lunch, 4 days in a row catches up to you.",3,Former Employee,Jewlry Associate ,"Bucyrus, OH",3/15/18,2018,3,15

It was a good place to work.,The atmosphere at this Wal-Mart was very family like. The drawback was not enough hours.

It's okay I guess? It's Walmart...,"It was stressful most of the time. The management was kind of all over the place, I guess that varies on the store though. They have decent benefits but you need to work a certain amount to get them - which would be fine if they actually gave you hours. The pay is getting better. The co-workers weren't horrible but they weren't great either. The customers were generally expecting the worst when they came in and it showed in their attitude towards associates. This all varies depending on the store of course. You really need to get the feel of your local Walmart before or right after you start working there before you get stuck.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,Kentucky,3/15/18,2018,3,15
It Wasn't Bad,"I honestly miss working at Walmart. I love working in a retail environment. I am a people person and I loved working in customer orientated environment. Each day was different. Some days were relaxed, others were not. Each department was different in its own way. I worked in many different departments and did different things in each one. The hours were long and you're on your feet for most of it. Sometimes customers were ornery, sometimes you'd go all day without a problem. Wages were low and you don't always qualify for health insurance. But you can get vision and dental no matter what.

Summary,"I think that Wall-Mart  is not fair to their employees and they don't get treated the way they should for the work they do and the stress from the customers sometimes does not help if an employee or customer is having a bad day, but Wall-Mart can be a great environment at times when in the break room for a break which is great that Wall-mart does give great break and its like a time out from the stress of customers or in some cases co-workers",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Fountain, CO",3/15/18,2018,3,15

Not worth the trouble,"It was a nightmare. Besides unrealistic expectations they wouldn't hire to fill the positions needed to complete the tasks. Those they did hire where the bottom of the barrel. For a time they stopped administering drug tests because so few people who were applying would pass them. Their solution was to stop testing. The store manager was a psychopath that would scream in your face if you didn't live up to his expectations. He would change schedules randomly throughout the week, not inform people of the change, and then scream at them if they didn't check their schedule daily to see if he changed it. During weekly meetings he would tell the department managers that we were not good enough, weren't hitting his expected sales, even if we were meeting company expectations, and would remind us we could be replaced if we didn't do better. within a year, when I left,  I was the last department manager that had been there when he came on because they had either quit or he had fired them.",1,Former Employee,Meat Department Manager ,"Overland Park, KS",3/15/18,2018,3,15

Front end manager was rarely seen, it was difficult to find time to see him. The coworkers are normally friendly however some CSMs play favorites. I enjoyed setting up the aisles and dealing with friendly customers. Hardest part was dealing with difficult customers and some members of management.

Profit driven,"If it didn't help profits, it didn't happen. They do not care about their associates and think they are/should be the most important thing in your life. They wouldn't even work with my school schedule. They started out by saying they would, then they would schedule you to work days your not available anyway and expect you to show up. Good luck getting full time spots and benefits, I've seen people that had been there for 10 years and are still part time; and not for a lack of trying.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",3/14/18,2018,3,14
Too Much Work and Not Enough Pay.,Good thing is there is always something that can be done at Wal-Mart. Problem is that there is neither enough hours in the day to do it or not enough people to complete the tasks in an 8 hour shift. Managers there micromanage you like crazy creating an extra stressful workload for their employees with unrealistic expectations which causes their customer service to suffer and high turnover rate in employment.,4,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate/Inventory/Lawn and Garden ,"Council Bluffs, IA",3/14/18,2018,3,14

Inventory Control,A typical day would begin with Capping all bins in the backroom for grocery. The Capping Process was to scan every bin and then all merchandise in that bin with a hand held scanner. When you scanned something that needed to go to the floor a beep would be heard. Once you have your cart loaded you go to the floor where you put groceries up. Then you scan the isle to see if anything else is needed. We used risers for some overstock. You would work your risers by bringing down anything that beeped. When finished with groceries you would go to another department to help there.,4,Former Employee,Inventory Control Specialist ,"Clear Lake, TX",3/14/18,2018,3,14
Decent Job,"Management team is my only complaint, but otherwise the job itself was simple. The company is great offers room for advancement and good benefits. But upper management is terrible!!!!",1,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Mays Landing, NJ",3/14/18,2018,3,14
There are pros and cons to a Walmart job.,"A typical day at work for a sales associate is waiting on customers and keeping departments clean and orderly.  I have learned about loss prevention, merchandising stock, safety in the workplace, customer relations and many job related skills.Management consists of men and women with many different styles of management.  Some are much easier to approach than others.Workplace culture is diverse  The hardest part of my job is not being able to please all customers and having constantly changing rules in the workplace.  Also knowing that you can be let go at any time with no explanation and no guarantee of dependable hours.  The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with people.  I enjoy treating customers that need help, the way I like to be treated as a customer.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Massillon, OH",3/14/18,2018,3,14

Depends on who running the shift it goes well,With Walmart you just have poor management because one min they want you to do something but they come back to you and expect this to be done at a certain time but you just getting use to it because you started or it’s just a lot for one person to do and it will probably take that person the whole night to finish the job.,5,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Columbia, SC",3/14/18,2018,3,14

walmart,It really depends on the Walmart you work at they are all treated different.  The walmart I used to work at they are ok at showing you around the store if needed but other than that because of the amount of work walmart needs out of their employees they don't have the time to walk around the store._x000D_You are NOT supposed to help any customers off the clock.  It does make sense but I don't like the the idea!  I still help customers either way.  If I work there and know where something is at then I will show them.  All I will say is I don't think Sam Walton would be very happy to see his baby being treated the way it is.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Huron, SD",3/14/18,2018,3,14
It was an easy job. Customer service can be a hand full.,They had good benefits. They matched up to 6% on your 401k and you could get shares though walmart.

Fast paste environment,A typical day at Walmart included greeting the customers and checking out their items quickly but efficiently. Management would have us probe the customers to get them to sign up for a Walmart credit card and gave us a glare if we didn't meet the daily quota. The culture of Walmart is being one big team and working together. The hardest part of the job is management getting mad about the cashiers not getting the daily quota of Walmart credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job is you make new friends and have someone you can vent to if your having a bad day.,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Athens, TX",3/13/18,2018,3,13
management don't care for the employee just the bonus,"come in short staffed, keep being told I'm slow but seems I'm going faster then most people in the group, get yelled at because I was caught with nothing in hand just after I set the box down but no one else does and they move slower then me, I feel that I'm being yelled at because I'm not the favorite.

This resulted in mistakes that would have not been made if properly staffed in the first place._x000D__x000D_ We would only get a half hour lunch break for the entire day.

Things such as high co-pays and late shipment of drugs from Walmart suppliers._x000D__x000D_Schedules would change with little notice in advance and were inaccessible most of the time on the buggy Walmart one app. Compensation was horrible and was little more than the door greeter with much less responsibility.",1,Former Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,USA,3/13/18,2018,3,13

"Good ""starting out"" job.","Typical customer service/retail job. Can be a fun place to work, but really depends on the staff/management. This job/company ultimately depends on how much you are willing to apply yourself. You get out what you put in. Plenty of hours scheduled to accumulate a steady paycheck.

Many employees work between 32 and 40 hours but are only considered part-time.  There is not a set type of schedule or set days off unless you put it in your availability however it is frowned at.

Wal mart was a challenging place but rewarding at times.,"Wal-Mart was a great work experience! For someone who had no experience they took a chance on me. I enjoyed working the sporting goods counter. Customer service was rewarding. I didn't feel I  was appreciated, but a typical day at Wal-Mart was never typical. In Customer Service you come across a whole lot of different people with different needs and wants. It was cultural to sometimes have to figure out what it was they needed and if we had the correct product in the store. If not we could suggest finding it online for them and ordering it that way.I would say the hardest part of the job was other crew members not pulling their weight on the sales floor whether it be with customers or with stocking product cleaning our areas, Etc.Management was good. I got to work different managers due to the rotating schedules they had, so I would get one manager for awhile then another manager would come along. At Wal-Mart I learned that people matter. No matter what race, religion, ethnicity, or background customers had needs. Wal Mart taught me how to communicate, work effectively, and to think for myself.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Washington State,3/12/18,2018,3,12

Shelby DC is Horrible!!,"Walmart distribution in Shelby NC is the absolute worst place I have ever stepped foot in. Everyday when I pull in the parking lot I have to talk myself into going in that day. I work in DA receiving (weekday nights) with the most petty, unhappy managers in the entire building. The production rate has almost doubled, and is impossible to make 95% of the time. The line is constantly stopping, but they don't give you down time, so your production is the same. They have taken our lunch breaks away, and left us with a 20min and a 15min for 10 hours or more, even though it takes longer than that to walk to the front and stand in line to TRY to order food. Training is also a joke in DA, so you have a lot of new employees with 2 days training and they have no idea how to do their job. Everyone that I have talked to including myself are currently looking for another job.....If you have ANY other options you may want to consider those first!!!",1,Current Employee,DA receiving Shelby DC ,Shelby NC,3/11/18,2018,3,11
"Not great, but better than other retail pharmacy settings","Walmart Pharmacies are probably the best place to be within the retail environment. The hours, the pay, the benefits- all are subject to your level of experience. It can be a hard learning curve, but once the ins and outs of the software are learned, it becomes a stable and sometimes fulfilling job. Walmart will train you, over and over again- it is in their interest to have trained associates. _x000D_I have worked at a Super Center and a Neighborhood Walmart, and both environments have their plus and minuses. The super center is hectic, from the moment the shift starts til it ends. But most of the basics are covered for you because there are so many more associates. So you have one maybe two major responsibilities. In the neighborhood market, you have to wear many hats. Pharmacy Tech, otc stocker, otc reorderer, trash manager,    etc. _x000D_Of course the hardest part of the job is maintaining a pleasant friendly atmosphere while engaging with difficult people.

I can always count on my coworker for help. they were always there. I count on my Manger to guild me threw any problems, and answer the question that I may  have.  The hardest part of the job is keeping your focus and maintaining it when a customer might be upset and shouting at you.

We need managers that are supportive and not afraid of the crew when the crew is wrong.,"There would be lines, and I would ask the manager for help and they would not move in time to satisfy the customers. Many I would have to ask twice. I mean it took me by storm. I had lines in front about 7 customers and about 8 at meat slicer. Managers allowed crew person to take extra time on lunch break. This crew person, I had been complaining about for almost 6 months.  Any way 6 customers walked away, and it killed me. I have been doing customer service for 40 years. Loosing one customer is one too many.  The manager asked me what did I want him to do.  Other than that, It was very exciting for me, and on a daily basis I loved working for Walmart and a lot of customers was glad to see me.

If you really need a job then apply to work here. Don't consider this a vilable long term position if you value your peace of mind.,Walmart has the potential to be a good employer but consistently falls short in areas of communication and changing expectations of employees. Restructuring and new business plans are often implemented before they are ready causing a lot of stress. Answering to multiple managers at the same time often causes confusion. Trying to address a problem is difficult and employees feel that raising problems to management's attention may be detrimental to them. Walmart makes every effort to look good in the media but employees often disagree. Recently base pay raises and bonuses were announced and this did happen. But the restructuring of jobs and terminations was kept as quiet as possible. After 14 years with this company my hours were abruptly cut with no managerial explanation. This has caused great stress among employees and a lot of personal frustration as this impacted decisions and plans I needed to make.,3,Former Employee,"Sales Associate, Overnight Stocker ","Amherst, NH",3/11/18,2018,3,11

Basic job,"Working for Walmart is simply basic. If you are like most people and must have a job to survive, this will kind of fit the bill. The pay is minimal, but you make more than you would at Dillon's. The hours are not great, but they are steady. You can count on having hours each week and getting paid every other week. But, they will not allow full time hours or overtime for the majority of their employees Other employees are friendly and easy to get along with, for the most part. I really enjoyed my job when I first began to work at Walmart. I started off in the bakery at a Walmart Neighborhood Market. But, the location I worked at was closed and I was transferred to another location. The new location was not ideal, the management was subpar and I ended up dreading going to work every day.

Wasn't as bad as you'd expect,"My usual shifts lasted nine hours. In those nine hours, I had an hour long lunch break (best part of the job, sometimes I went home and took a nap during my break) and two fifteen minute breaks. Coworkers and management were very helpful, I was young and it was my first job so it was very reassuring to know I had good help when I needed it. I worked in the Site to Store department and there were a lot of flaws in the system for customer orders to the store. A package that was said to have arrived would disappear about daily. I also handled Layaway, which is a little chaotic but fun and challenging. One thing I noticed from management was the lack of care for customers who didn't have their way. Any complaint was brushed aside and ignored. In customer service, that's not a good habit",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,Arizona,3/9/18,2018,3,9

Never Ever again working for this company.,"Dont work for walmart if you expect to be treated fairly and decently by management. They look down on you and only care about their money as a whole. They dont care about employees at all. Work and benefits are not worth working for this company either. They dont pay enough for me to consider still working for them with the stress, and doing managements job for them as well.

I was removed from my position because I wasn't doing enough work. I was working 40-50 hours a week and having to cover all the parts of the service center when someone called in and do all my paperwork and my managers paperwork. I trained all the service writers and had daily meetings with them to get them onto the sales goals for services and tires. But I wasn't doing enough work.

I do recommend Wal-Mart if there are no other forms of employment for you. However, do prepare yourself to be around favoritism and ethics that are not followed.

Not the best,For doing what i did at Walmart the pay was good. Much better than some of my other jobs. Although Walmart only notices the end result of work rather than work throughout the day. This means that if Morning shift employees slack on the job it falls on the ending shift to pick it all up. the would be no discipline for the morning shift. If you ask for days off and get them you might still end up on the schedule as they have a computer generate schedules as oppose to having a manager do it. This also led to some of my shift being a close then open type of deal.,3,Current Employee,Maintenance ,"San Antonio, TX",3/9/18,2018,3,9

Assistant Manager - Absolutely No Home/Work Life Balance. Hours++,"The pay is good but it is only paid for 40 hours.  The start out is usually around 50k for an external hire.  There is a lot of overtime and it is worked unpaid as it is salaried.  Very seldom a weekend off - maybe once every three months.  Some of the benefits are good like the stock plan and 401(k).  The medical coverage is lousy with a high deductible and high employee biweekly premiums.  This is the highest stress position in the company and the highest turnover because of burnout, stress and work hours.  It takes the right person and some people are able to do it if they are devoted to their jobs and if they want their job to be there whole life.  There are some other positions that are good, decent jobs at Walmart such as department manager, support manager etc. as these are hourly positions and not salaried.",3,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Maquoketa, IA",3/9/18,2018,3,9
An interactive work enviorment,"A typical day at work would consist of coming in and then clocking in of course. Then came some of the stress waiting on the manager to tell you where to go (if you're new). then you just proceeded to work until about your 2nd hour and then you would take your first 15 minute break, then on your 4th hour you would have your lunch, and on your 6th hour you would have your last 15 minute break. my work day was a good 9 hours/10 if you count lunch. honestly the only bad part about working is when you get hired like if you get hired when I did,( around thanksgiving and Christmas) then you'll get really great hours until after the holidays. I went from working 5 days a weeks sometimes 6, 9 hours a day to 3 days a week for 5 hours a day. also the big 10% discount you get you don't get until you have been with the company for 3 months. the health benefits don't come until 6 months.",5,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"London, KY",3/9/18,2018,3,9

Best as a temporary job,Walmart is not known for being a great employer so it shouldn't come as a surprise that my review won't be a shining one.

A job when you need one,"As long as you come in on time and do what(somewhat) you should, you'll be okay....

Good Job,"I was an IMT at Walmart for a year. The first 2-4 hours of our shift was unloading trucks.

I was hired as full-time, but as soon as they found out that I had a 2nd job that was only part-time, they started cutting my hours. They didn't have enough cashiers, and since EVERYONE knows how busy Wal-mart can be, this made for a very stressful experience.

I miss my store, would've stayed if I didn't move.

fast paced work environment,"It was only a temporary job for me, as I was getting my degree while working there.  However, it was always a very exciting place to work.  It kept me busy all day, which I enjoy, and the time flew by.  Standing up all day is a little tiring, but you get used to it over time.  Also, some customers are rude and unnecessarily mean, but that comes with any customer service job.  Just smile and try to help them out as best as you can.  Everyone has bad days.

At one time shortly after I started working for Walmart I was yelled at for doing something I had no idea I was not supposed to do and the  manager's assistant sounded off right behind her. This was in front of other associates, customers, anyone in ear's shot. This is typical of any day.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Taylors, SC",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Promises unkept,"They promise a lot and deliver little. They do not hire you as a full-time employee, therefore they do not have to offer the benefits they say they are available, because they are only available to full-time associates. Mis-communication and cross-direction is a common flaw at management and supervisor levels.
