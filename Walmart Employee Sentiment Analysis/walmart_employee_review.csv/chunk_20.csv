"I want to go back, best job I had in a long time",I plan to reapply to walmart in december. Everyone there is nice for the most part and you are not always stuck in your department. Management encourages working up the ladder and promotions. You work a nine hour day (two 15min breaks and 1 hour off the clock lunch) You get a discount and you can cash your check instead of running to a bank. Plenty of people to help and assist.,5,Former Employee,Assist customers ,"Fredericksburg, VA",8/18/18,2018,8,18

Review,Working here was as stressful as work gets; hours flexed sometimes without employees knowing. A lot of people were in and out of my workplace due to management not knowing how to properly address their associates and for unfair work environment. My job was not hard but the people I sometimes had to work with were a nightmare. It also does very little to encourage people to work when the managers are biased (that is just my opinion based on my own observation).  I did not enjoy working for Walmart at all and wold not recommend it to anyone.,2,Former Employee,Meat Associate ,"Chesapeake, VA",8/18/18,2018,8,18
Excellent on Safety,"A typical day of 10 hours consist of moving, lifting,stacking pallets with the RC forklift. Working for this company I have TEAMWORK is the primary word for SUCCESS. Teamwork will carry a business a long way. The hardest part of the job is when the job hires employees that come in and don't like work to get the job done. They just wanna get free money. You train them up and they end up getting fired because the production was not meet. Now HR has to continue to hire.I enjoy that our break is paid for and we don't clock out. They also treat us with ice cream, hot dogs and hamburgers, chips and cookies for no reason and yearly bonuses.",5,Current Employee,Warehouse Worker ,"Atlanta, GA",8/18/18,2018,8,18

Walmart is Rapidly Changing,"Walmart is not the same company it was 15 years ago. And all stores and store management teams are not created equal. The culture is drastically different from one store to the next and one store manager to the next. At teams it seems Walmart has a clear vision for the future, and at other times it seems they’re grasping for straws. The salary is good, the benefits are OK, and the atmosphere is OK if you end up in a good store. Otherwise... good luck.",3,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Aurora, MO",8/17/18,2018,8,17
Long and Stressful,"This job demands you to work to the bone for minimal pay. The Management in the facility can be very disrespectful to the employees that are trying to do their best to get the work done in a quick and safe manner.

Friendly work environment,"The work is tough and stressful, and some days the goals management gives you for the day are very difficult to reach, and sometimes they're not even reachable, but it's good work. Walmart also offers decent benefits if you stay there long enough, but with their occurrence system, if you happen to get sick with anything more than a cough or cold within the first six months, it's almost guaranteed that you'll get terminated, because you can't miss more than three or four days of work. So, if you decide to work for Walmart, be sure you are willing to work hard and not let yourself or your family get sick.",3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Richland, WA",8/17/18,2018,8,17

Enjoyable if management didn’t show favoritism,I loved working at Walmart and regret the times I quit because there were some enjoyable moments and the pay was great. The only thing that bothered me the most was there was some managers that would often choose who they got in trouble or who they liked. They would get onto the ones they didn’t like for the smallest of things and not say anything to the ones they do like. Also when I reapplied for a job the second time they lied to me on numerous amounts about not hiring or they couldn’t hire me because of corporate. I ended up calling corporate and they said there was no reason they couldn’t hire me. I never really had anything bad said about me that I know of so I could never understand why they would lie to me and refuse to hire me.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Booneville, MS",8/17/18,2018,8,17

I learned a great deal about how a retail store works on the inside as well as how inventory and customer service is dealt with.  The workplace culture was more casual and friendly than strict and isolated.  I think the hardest part of the job was dealing with large amounts of freight, much more than average, combined with less associates than normal.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to advise and direct the customers about products and to where those products are, as well as being able to use my benefits without much red tape.",5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Martin, TN",8/17/18,2018,8,17
Don't belive the corporate culture,"Walmart's corporate culture and mission statements sound great.  Visiting Bentonville or Home Office will really promote the culture that corporate wants to have.

Effective temporary job. Don't make a career of it.,"Overall, the company is not the best to work for, nor is it entirely the worst. A typical day of work is usually tiring and stressful. I'm generally an anxious sort of person, so I was often worried about dealing with an unruly or outrageous customer or a manager that was lazy or in a bad mood. On a full shift, you get three breaks, two being 15 minutes long and an hour lunch. Often times the breaks would be late or unevenly spaced (for instance: first fifteen being an hour after you arrive, lunch two and a half hours after that, last and hour and forty-five after lunch had concluded). The customers are frankly worse than the management. It's not unusual to hear about someone who had left feces on the floor or someone holding up checkout lines or someone getting incredibly angry or frustrated. Sometimes it's not the customers' fault either, some of the employees are rather nasty or rude. I didn't learn much, other than the fact that dealing with a thousand people each day is stressful. The most difficult part of my job was monitoring for theft. Often times it's hard to notice whether or not someone is attempting theft. When you can confirm they are attempting to steal, it's difficult to confront them and say that their items weren't scanned properly or the machine didn't pick up. The most enjoyable part is the fact we have breaks and an hour lunch, though it goes by fast. Some customers are very pleasant to talk to as well.",3,Current Employee,Self-Checkout Cashier ,"Saint Clairsville, OH",8/17/18,2018,8,17

Greedy and corupt,"When I first started wal-mart was fun to work for. However over time a new store manager took over and started to delete positions and lowering the amount of workers in a given depatment. Leaving some departments either with just one worker or none to help customers. They no longer care about the customer and instead let customers wait for a long time in lines rather than spend the money to hire more people. The higher ups dictate how many workers they need based on sales of the previous year and smaller stores with lower volume, none of the higher ups have worked in the departments they cut people out of, but expevts one worker to do the job of five people and if they can't finish the work they get punished with coachings and terminations.",3,Current Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Valparaiso, IN",8/17/18,2018,8,17

Terrible management and unrealistic expectations,A typical day at work was usually stressful.

My review as an emploee,I worked for Walmart for five and a half years . I like it at first I was they’re forever. Things are constantly changing at Walmart.

Don't expect or trust so much from management.,"Walmart was a good open place to learn alot about the company. Doing your job well like a real mature positive retail employee. I've been having my integrity self with Walmart since day 1 I follow through well mostly with their policy but here was my main issue the lack of giving notice communication from the managers. Not a lot care enough to help out or are good with scheduling days with a two way street communication they seem to care more about their own lives and job descriptions on self.. My best advice if you plan to work here work at job that you know you can maintain well for a long period of time instead of taking the risk for something. The Employees there are friendly, nice, and decent but the customers that come in you'll find are eagerly stubborn especially when they are in a hurry , they are close minded, and some express their hate toward Walmart by littering a lot of trash or looking for sueing.",2,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"575 Walmart Supercenter , Woodstock, GA",8/16/18,2018,8,16

Pretty decent,Walmart is a great job if you can stand sometimes lousy managers and always lousy customers. The pay isn't bad and the benefits are awesome.

Working at Walmart,"While having worked for the company for the last 15 years, overall I would say the experience was a good one. However the last two years under my new store manager were very difficult. Each set back even if not the fault of the store ( logistic issues with delivers ) was seen as a purposeful failure to make them look bad.  12 plus hours days that were only scheduled to be 10 hours days on a near consistant basis added to stress problems as well as personal health problems.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Vestal, NY",8/16/18,2018,8,16

Stressful and Non-Rewarding Work Environment,"A typical day here depends on your staffing. If you have enough people to work registers, and other customer service managers to help you, then you're going to be fine. If you don't, which is more often than not, then this job is going be overwhelming and stressful.

However, sometimes the people you work with are also what cause you the most problems. Management in a Walmart can make or break you.

First manager was great, the next one had zero clue who any of his people were and was never thankful for the work they did. The expectations are a little too high for such a large company. One individual is expected to complete ten hours of work in less than three. The major problem is the type of people hired are young lazy individuals that don't want to work as a team.  I saw a ton of favortism in all stores as well as racism from all types of backgrounds. Everything just comes down to management and how much you are willing to take sitting down. I knew people that worked at Walmart for 12 years and were only making $10.20 (that was only after their new and improved pay rates) and others that worked there less than two and were making $14. Their pay is again in the favoritism field and completely unfair for people who work hard.

Some were lazy and did nothing while some did a lot. I do enjoy working with my fellow associates. Never had a problem with anybody.  Stocking is easy to do but the hard part was the days we had a lot to do and not enough associates working that day. I did enjoy stocking until they started changing everything at Walmart. They screwed up everything and fellow associates didnt like the change also. Things worked fine before they started changing things. All we needed were just a few more associates and we keeped saying we need more to managers but they never hired more people. Once the change things, the managers said it was for the good but it wasn’t. Made things harder for my shift and most people left Walmart after this change.

Easy starting job but managers expect too much,With working for Walmart and for 2 years and starting out as a regular associate I have come to realize that yes every job there is easy but it is the managers that make it difficult. They truly expect a lot from everyone and sometimes it’s just too much. I have worked in the deli and went up to the rank of a support manager which is one step below being an assistant manager and I must say while the pay is good the amount of stress I go under for the actual outcome just isn’t worth it in my opinion. I have seen managers pick and choose favorites all the time. Or see someone get targeted and when I have brought it up is like the upper management doesn’t care.

"Tolerable, and for what we do, the pay is fair to slightly unfair.","Wal-mart hands are tied as far as letting people go.  Their turn around is so high, they need to keep bodies.  To me this is bad for business.  They have an annual across the board raise, which isn't good for the people who really bring their best everyday.  Someone who gives 50% is given the same raise as someone who brings 100%.  It creates tension.  The good thing about the place is you never have to worry about layoffs, and they have outstanding benefits.

Good and bad,Walmart keeps changing with the times. Most of the older people cant deal with it. Walmart needs to slow down so the older people shop there. Staffing is always horrible every day of the week especially on the weekends. They never want to hire the people that are needed when their needed. The best part I like are the associates who you get to bond with and for the most part you like them and like working with them. _x000D_Walmart is one of the biggest retailers in the world but yet they dont wanna pay people what their worth based on what they do. The give the same amount of money for someone to stand and swipe things across a scanner as they do for a team of people to unload a 53 foot trailer.

Lost their way,"Day to day operations reveal that the actual core beliefs (respect for the individual, striving for excellence, acting with integrity) are no where to be found.  Instead, like alot of other large companies, the mantra is do MORE with less - that is, less hours, less staff.  As a result neither customers, nor associates are happy.  The difference being that unhappy customers have other shopping options.  Perhaps the most effective method for checking the pulse of any retail establishment is to ask an associate for help.  An associate that is overwhelmed with tasks will often resent the interruption of task number 65 of 100.  Is it right?  Absolutely not.  However, like many other companies, the effort to bring profits to the shareholders often out weighs the logical necessity to staff according to the needs of the customer.",2,Current Employee,Support Manager ,"Dallas-Fort Worth, TX",8/15/18,2018,8,15

The general management was a real hands on type.  He kept the store really clean and nice for his customers.  Some of the CSM's could be rude if they got too stressed out.

The management face,"Although the company is a giant and has changed to allow some individual expression, the truth is that they want all employees to wear the same stenciled face. As long as it is not outright theft, the managers will surrender to a customers complaint no matter  how ridiculous.

Courtesy Associate Is Harder Than It Looks,"Doing my job is rather stressful. You are out there in the direct sun, beating down on you at 106-112 degrees during the summer here, having to push carts by hand or with the mule, bringing them to the bay area while clearing up any carts in front of the entrance. Managers step out to see your work and if they spot corrals with carts in them, they badger you about it. Sometimes they think you are lazy and yell at you about your job. The major issue I have with this job is help. Not many people want to do this job, so they hide or don't show up, leaving the rest of us to pick up their mess. There will be days where I will be the only one to clean up the lot for hours. My store is a superstore, so the lot is huge. My advice to you if you want this job, prepare yourself with things that will keep you cool during the day and during cold weather. Also be prepared to be short handed with help. Sometimes managers don't have anyone to help you so they wish you the best to clean up the lot. FML",3,Current Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"North Las Vegas, NV",8/14/18,2018,8,14

Fast paced and aggravating.,"My experience with Wal-Mart. Lets put it this way. I was a produce stocker moving upwards of 15,000 pounds of product everyday. The work is not difficult it's labor intensive and for me, I don't mind that. What I mind is that it's me and one other co-worker trying to process 15,000 lbs. of freight in the 4 hours that they want it done. It's not even humanly possible to scan label and organize a massive cooler that your night staff destroys everyday. On top of that you have to stock a near empty floor. Wal-Mart is severely understaffed and my store manager didn't understand that more people usually means more work can be done in a shorter amount of time. Really all the management is like that. You try to communicate to come up with a solution so you don't run into the same problem anymore and they say ""OK."" Walk away and absolutely nothing changes. In my opinion its a great high school job or right out of high school. Other than that if you have the capacity and work ethic to move forward defiantly leave Wal-Mart. There is a small possibility to make Wal-Mart a career but in my opinion you will get short change and used and get pawned off to the next individual that just follows mindless orders and doesn't want to fix problems. For Wal-Mart was temporary and will never be anything more. The benefits and pay could be way better. Especially with the sheer size and economic strong hold Wal-Mart has. Just remember its not about the employee or the ""customer"" it's about the guy in charge and the surplus of millions they make. I'm not saying the bottom of the totem poll worker should - more...",2,Former Employee,Produce Stocker ,"Enterprise, AL",8/13/18,2018,8,13
It was a very negative place to work,I thought Walmart was a good place to work for until they cut 10 of our highest paid people and left them high and dry. Some of them had 20 plus years invested. It was heartbreaking. Walmart isn’t about family or bettering yourself. It’s a depressing place to work. They suck the life out of you.,1,Former Employee,Receiving Manager ,"Canton, IL",8/13/18,2018,8,13

No Work/Life Balance and ungrateful market/regional directors,"I've never worked for a more greedy and ungrateful company than Walmart.  The salary from the outside world looks so appealing until they force you to work 70+ hours a week with no holidays off and the only bonuses come if the total store makes it's sales for the year.  The market and regional level do not care about a work/life balance and will find any reason to write you up and fire you from the management position if you don't give into working their insane amount of hours.  Even if you do they still pass over you for promotions, knowing that they wouldn't be able to find another person to put into your position to work those hours.  And never have the words ""Thank You"" come from any higher up managers.  The company prides itself off hiring from within and retaining its' associates yet will continuously post job opening on only external sites and not even post them for internal candidates to apply for.  You spend 12+ hours every day getting yelled at by bosses and customers only for nothing to be good enough.  Their Human Resources are a joke.  If you try to speak with them about concerns you get told that they don't have time to chat with you and have more pressing matters.

Customer oriented,Great place to work at as long as you have opportunities and a hard working management team.

"Great first job, plenty of work hours, and multiple departments to learn.",Walmart is a busy place to work at. Often times there is not enough help and so you will learn to work in a multitude of areas. You will experience both tough times and good times but in general if you want to work there is plenty of work available. This job is great for anyone who likes to serve customers and does not mind wearing multiple hats.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Hudson, MA",8/12/18,2018,8,12

"Works fine, the people and treatment are awful.","Of the two years I worked for Walmart not once did I feel respected or cared for in the slightest. I was worth less to them then the dirt on there shoes, they didn't mind working our best employees to the point of quiting, repeatedly. It wasn't rare that multiple associates left per month. Other shifts were never made to do their job, while we were stuck with everything. We were also to blame for everything that went wrong. Not to mention the lack of equipment to get your job done in the first place. There is no place I would recommend working at less that Walmart. Never have I seen such a blatant disregard for human life. I was still treated poorly after returning to work only a few weeks after the death of my father. It was then I decided to move on from Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Morganton, NC",8/12/18,2018,8,12

Can be unchallenging and stressful,"Walmart provides good benefits. Depending on what your position, this can be a boring place and unchallenging or it can be fast paced.

Would be good if management wasn't terrible.,"Wal-Mart is an ok place to work, probably depends on which store you go to and the management team there. In my experience they hardly properly train people. They seem to more prefer trial by fire which then puts stress on the other associates  as they have to do their own work while shlwing the newbs at the same time. WHEN someone is absent or they have a position to fill they would rather pull from other departments for months at a time instead of hiring a new person. Why hire another body when you can get someone else to do 2 jobs for the price of 1? Turnover rate is crazy because they have unrealistic expectations in getting things done, especially when your team is crippled on top of them trying to cover multiple positions with fewer people than required. When they do hire for a position they apparently just throw anyone into it. One of my direct supervisors was a felon so obviously they don't care much about proper background checks. At store 5441 they pick and choose who they want to help advance. If you tell them no on any request then they'll make sure you get stuck where you are or worse. Management is never on the same page. One manager will come by and tell you to do things a certain way then later another will say that it's wrong and needs to be redone. I once was written up for asking a manager to help pull a truck since she was just standing about watching because  the electric pallet jack was down. They call anything over 34 hours full time and if you attempt to work more than your scheduled hours they tend to make you leave early to cancel that additional time. - more...",2,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Topeka, KS",8/11/18,2018,8,11

I walked into work and my whole team was gone.,"Walmart was the most stressful company I've ever worked for. Policies were constantly changing, employees were constantly changing departments, we were grossly understaffed, and constantly overworked. The biggest challenge was convincing my superiors to let me work in my department and not in another department, even when I was the only person in the department and the oven was running. I clocked into work one morning only to be told that I was the only person left in my department. Everyone else had been transferred, and I would be working alone (and I did for the next four to five months).",2,Former Employee,Bakery/Deli Associate ,"Virginia Beach, VA",8/11/18,2018,8,11

Started with only 7.25 in 2009. That was when the economy was in a recession,I was greatful I started when when jobs were scarce in 2009. But at the time Walmart only paid 7.25 the minumum.

Worst Job I've Had,"Several managers were often rude and very condescending. Customers were allowed to be very verbally abusive to employees and policies were not followed for returns, making employees look foolish in front of customers. There were almost never enough cashiers scheduled, never enough people to run customer service, and never enough people in the lot to gather and bring in carts. While CSMs did not make the schedules, they were blamed for long lines and carts not being in. It was very difficult to get a response to calls for help up front and several employees were very rude about it to us, even though we were just doing our job. We'd also be given multiple responsibilities, while our other CSMs would be trapped in customer service or on register, so you'd have one CSM trying to do propane (outside), jewelry counter, cosmetics case (several aisles away from the front end), kayaks, answer cashier questions, get change for registers, fix self-checks, and help in customer service, but they’d still get yelled at by management over the radio for not watching the lines.

Pay is average, but at least above minimum wage and full time or part time had benefits. Can be either really stressful or somewhat monotonous depending on which department you work in.

Stressful and Challenging,"My Walmart was not the easiest place to work, sometimes i would have to stay late to finish my work, other times i would finish all of my work and be able to leave a few minutes early.

"Very Boring, lots of busy work","I worked overnights hired as a cashier. Ended up being a cashier, stocker, custodian, and sales associate. Not the biggest fan of the work.

It's okay but definitely not a first choice,"I enjoy a high majority of the people I work with and have yet to really meet someone I dislike. It's such a wide variety of individuals- including a few Trans and Gay associates, which is okay with me- I am friends with a few of them. _x000D_Typically, our department (apparel) will be getting what we need done and then management will 'inform' us that we need to do something else, which puts us behind in our other tasks, then they'll be mad that we didn't get everything done. _x000D_Sometimes the schedule will be so messed up that there will only be 2 people in the department, sometimes 5. Theres been times that there hasnt been anyone for another department (we'll say Jewelry or Site to Store) so when someone needs help there, they pull us and have us help them- which puts us behind even more. _x000D_There have been a few managers that try to insert themselves in associates lives away from work (lunch breaks, or days off) when they have no right to, as we are not on the clock anymore. _x000D_Hardest part of the job, I would say, would be when customers get mad at us, when its a different department or associates fault (not answering the phone, telling them incorrect information, ect. ). _x000D_On the bright side though, I adore the associates that have became friends and I wouldnt trade them- or the experience (however good or bad it has been) for the world.",4,Current Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Mount Vernon, OH",8/9/18,2018,8,9

Do not apply cap 2,"It started off as a great job with good managers. Quickly turned into the most toxic environment I've ever been in. Typically had to work an excess of 5-9 hours of freight a day with little to no help. No real training from anyone other than coworkers who did it their own ways. Most of the good managers quit when we got a new store manager because of the unrealistic standards placed on them. We were consistently short staffed and under motivated to complete the work. Rushed and mismanaged by supervisors. Unloading the truck was an absolute nightmare daily, sometimes dragging on for 3 or more hours. No breaks or lunch until the truck was completely finished. Some workers were favored more than others when it came to time off being granted and most managers pawned off their duties to other staff. No room for growth or opportunities for promotions. I was working full time hours but listed as a part time associate, so I could reap no full time benefits, i.e not enough pto, no healthcare.",1,Former Employee,Cap team 2 ,"Centerville, OH",8/9/18,2018,8,9

Management,As a Department manager I had several responsibilities. I had 3-4 associates scheduled to my department and was expected to delegate the responsibilities to them. I would have loved to have done that but as soon as my associates would clock on the front-end managers would take them up to the registers before I could ever see them.

Work you to the bone with no respect for employees,My experience working at walmart was ok at first. There was bullying with other associates anfd tried to get help but management said I was wasting their time.

Management was shady,Management at my Walmart was shady. They did not want you to promote and they would terminate workers if they would go against them.

Program designed for high turnover,"Very inconsistent management...high turnover with managers..each manager changed the work profile and style.  Assistant managers were always afraid for their job and acted out of frustration many time.  Evidently, there was no standard management training or rewards for store atmosphere.

Average but with drawbacks,Wal-Mart overall is an average place however starting out. They don't teach you well and expect new hires to know everything they're supposed to do in a few days. The pay is low and the insurance is expensive. You get a discount of 10% off of non-edible items. Nothing off groceries though! They expect people to do 3 peoples worth of work. If you're a hard obedient worker work their temporarily. Don't work midnights,3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Festus, MO",8/9/18,2018,8,9
"Fast pace, every changing enviorment",Unrealistic standards set for hourly associates that require management to finish their jobs taking away from actual managerial duties.

Terrible place to work,Management doesn't know what they are doing and the people have to pick up the slack.  Can be forced to work up to 14 hours a day and mandatory overtime on scheduled days off.

very stressful,"well a typical 8-5 shift consists of me covering both sides and making sure that the bottles and cans machines are in working order as well as doing carry outs for customers. it also consists of me getting yelled at for both sides not being stocked.

"Good company to work for, but not perfect.","Walmart is a good company to work for.  They do promote from within.  The store manager that I worked with started out as an hourly associate.  However, Walmart's #1 priority is their bottom line.  Walmart likes to make itself look good.  For example, they gave us pay raises so that they could say, ""We LOVE our associates!""  But to pay for the pay raises, they cut our hours so that we were actually earning less money per pay check than what we were getting before the pay raises.",3,Former Employee,Food Sales Associate ,"Scottsbluff, NE",8/8/18,2018,8,8

Fun place to work while serving customers.,I really enjoyed working there until they hired a bad management team. It was like walking on pins and needles there.

Disorganized and drama filled environment,Walmart has stollen overtime hours from me right before I am suppose to get paid. They know when people come in for overtime and don’t say anything until the very last minute before you’re suppose to get paid and management is poor and never really listens to employees concerns and ideas.

Assistant management needs work.,"The Assistant Managers are all nice to customers, but totally rude and down talk all the associates. When you could stay away from management and focus on the job without their nitpicking, it really isn't too bad. It is retail, so you do get the occasional rude customer that will flip out on you like you are a councilor and have to listen to them, which sadly, you do. Thankfully I had amazing supervisors that I did get to be around on a daily basis that had really nice manners, and a level way of thinking in stressful events. I learned that I am worth more than what the company could offer, so I decided to leave and stop the misery of working for minimal pay and always having stress from upper management.",2,Former Employee,Auto Care Center Technician ,"Broken Arrow, OK",8/8/18,2018,8,8

My manager was very understanding when I need time off for my studies. I couldn’t always take he day off but because there was a strong line of communication, I was able to go to him and ask permission to leave early if I had a test due by 12 am, a test the next day or if I was just simply behind on homework. My typical work day was very smooth. My shift started at 12 and ended at 8 most days. My job was very simple and that was being a cashier.

Poor wages and no respect for co workers.,"Worked for this company a total of 11 years and have seen them becoming worse and worse with work practices and poor wages. They give the same raise percentage to every employee whether you are hard working or a slacker; and with the pay bump, new highers make as much as tenured employees who have been there even 5 years. They do not care about their employees well being, only about the work agenda and making money. It is not a healthy work environment for anyone wishing to move up in the company.

Not for me,"I worked third shift. The cashing part was ok. I also had to do some stocking and some shop back. The worse part was that an hour before ending my shift I would be taken out of my position to go over to grocery to help them finish stocking their shelf and zone them. I did not like this because most of the time while doing shop back I would see people not doing there work or working slowly on purpose while talking to their friends. When I as a cashier had checked out customers all night, done shop back, but clothing on racks between customers and stocked my own shelfs. It helped to increase my customer service skills. This also was a difficult position because one of the managers did not like me and the other did, he was very helpful when there was a problem with a transaction.

Lack of leadership provides stressful days,"Poor management does directly affect the productivity of the store as a whole. The job duties are quite simple to carry out.

I have learned a lot and hopefully I can apply those skills to future employment opportunities.

I left a previous job where I worked for 13 years because Walmart started me out at what it took me 13 years to make at my previous job. I now make $6 more!

"In essence ,my  summary review reflects the positive key points found while working for Walmart.","The most enjoyable part of my job at Walmart was the one to one customer service experience. I would typically go to each department  in order to find the correct products in order to give the best customer service experience. A perfect example was working the day prior to hurricane Irma in September 2017.I even climbed up into the rafters in the garden center to bring down plastic huge totes so  persons were able to keep their perishable foods fresh. A typical day at work entailed stocking and zoning each aisle, returning returned items from customer service back to my department,returning damaged goods to the back room, preparing isles for back to school and overall I am self motivated and enjoy sharing ideas with others with sharp attention to details.",4,Former Employee,"Arts and crafts, stationary and fabric associate ","LaBelle, FL 33935",8/6/18,2018,8,6

Both of our families have health problems and we are very family oriented. I got fired for calling out to make hospital runs cause family needed to go to the hospital. Very bad company will never consider working for them ever again nor will I ever recommend people I know or talk to work there. Not worth the pay for all the BS I went through did managers job and managers kept trying to get me to move up but never promoted me.

Walmart is not what you make of it....it is what you settled for,"There are no educational requirements at Walmart. That gives you (or it ought to) an idea of who they're hiring. They take PRIDE in telling you where they started out, but how many people in MANAGEMENT have an MBA???? Why do I have more education than most people at the store INCLUDING Mgmt? Why is it that THAT education is not used to benefit the store at a higher degree? Because I have a disability?  You would think someone with a MA degree + 15 credits would have a better job at Walmart....but then again....why would you think that??? I obviously settled._x000D__x000D_ Their turnover is a revolving door spun at 78 rpm. The store in Lindon was and is run poorly in my opinion. All I needed was a SIMPLE schedule change with another employee and it COULD be done, but they refused to do so. I told the other employee to go to the store manager's office to talk with them regarding our need to swap schedules.....to no avail. They chose to avoid it. It is not hard but because they may see me as a marginal or slower employee who doesn't brown nose to get what needs to be accomplished, then there is no effort on their side to assist in something that would be in their best interest. _x000D__x000D_I was actually promoted to a higher pay grade which doesn't show a lack of faith in my abilities, it should do the opposite....but no....they had me scheduled on paper and on contract from 1pm-10pm and that was 3 weeks ago....it still hasn't taken place and you would think that an undermanned bakery with 3-4 people would spread the hours around so that there is coverage throughout the day....nope._x000D__x000D_You get what - more...",1,Current Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Lindon, UT",8/6/18,2018,8,6

No family life or compensation,"The work hours at Wal Mart are never the same so you can not plan anything with your family, One week you might be off Tuesday and Thursday and the next week Monday and Wednesday, You will hardly ever be off on a weekend until you have been there a few years. When it can time to take a vacation day or days they had to approve it first but most of the time they would not approve a vacation on the weekend or one that ran into the weekend. It might not look like a lot of work but if you are a stocker you are on the move from the time you clock in until you clock out, A lot of the items you have to lift are heavy, 50 to 100 lbs, and you must work fast to get the items stocked within your shift. The pay for this work is not enough to live on unless you have a spouse with a good paying job, you live with your parents or you are semi retired.  It would be a good place for students still living at home or in a dorm to work but other than that it will not provide you with enough to pay the bills.",1,Former Employee,Team Member ,"Carthage, TX",8/6/18,2018,8,6

Customer Service Manager at Walmart,"My experience working as a customer service manager at Walmart is that no matter what you do, you will never be treated as a ""manager"" and will solely be a ""glorified cashier with keys"".   Don't expect any help from upper management if you have a problem as the front end is treated as a ""necessary evil"" and not a necessity.  You will easily be replaced and management will have no issues with coaching or terminating you for any mistakes made.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Bakersfield, CA",8/6/18,2018,8,6

There is a tv in the lounge which is a step in the right direction for the associates.,"It was a great  place to work at one time, but with trying to replace full time workers with part time, it has become unrealistic in job responsibilities.

Sometimes you were getting 19ish hours a week. The managers were sub par and would belittle you. Actually, no they weren’t at first.

The job was good in the beginning and started to go downhill over the years.,Was a good job at first.  Management changed so many times over the years and everybody wanted to do things their way.

Nice Company To Work For,"I really enjoy working with this company, but my lack of maturity made me miss out on what could been a great career.

nice culture for the most part,"nice pay but you do have to work for it, long hours, not enough breaks, people need more than 2 20 minute breaks on 12+ hour shifts, nice restrooms compared to other warehouses however the staff constantly destroys them, bad morale coming from temporary staff, truly believe culture would be better through out without the use of contracted employees, bonuses could never be met to any amount due to temporary staff for the most part not doing their share simply cause they didn't receive the Walmart bonus so why work for it. some changes definitely need to take place however, over all decent place to make a living compared to other things you could be doing. they definitely give your raises when they say, first place ive ever known to actually do that.

"My personal Experience, Bad","Walmart was my first job. I did the best I could do, given management staff. Everything seemed dysfunctional at any given time, so following the rules could be a bit difficult.

Nothing you wouldn't expect from the biggest retail work out there.,"There are good managers, there are less good managers, there are days where you want to pull your hair out from all the deadlines and stress, there are days where things are pretty lax because half your shift didn't call in.

Learn patience with people FAST!,"Throughout the day, you must deal with customers ranging from very courteous and understanding to extremely demanding and rude. The work is simple, but it is constant and fast paced, and, as a cashier,  you deal with the short comings of all the other departments and end up having to rectify them. Do not recommend if you don't like working with the general public, but if you want to learn people skills, this is a good jump off the deep end with instant feedback. And the employee discount is only %10, not including most food products, so not good if that's factored into you applying.

I hope it was just the area but I doubt it.,1,Former Employee,Walmart  Certified Tire and Lube Technician ,"Elko, NV",8/5/18,2018,8,5
Is it worth it?,"It is my experience that Walmart employs a threat based management philosophy.  By this I mean that senior managers continually, almost daily, warn their subordinates that they will be ""Coached for Improvement"" (formal documented process) or replaced if this or that is not completed. Positive reinforcement simply does not exist in the Walmart culture._x000D__x000D_On the other hand Walmart compensates its salaried managers well and offers generous pto & benefits.",3,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Texas,8/5/18,2018,8,5

Favoritism,"Wal-Mart is comparable to high school kinda, if they like you then good for you, you'd probably have a shot to move up in the company.

"Great company with many opportunities, poor management","Walmart is an excellent, growing company to work for. Annual raises and bonuses were a great reward for work put in. I was trained in most departments as well as able to cashier and work the back room. Typical nights are easygoing once trained and in the flow of things. Coworkers help guide you and show you how things should be done. The hardest part about my job was trying to seek help from management but was easily helped by experienced coworkers.

Excellent starting job,"If a job is what one wants, Walmart is always hiring. However, moving up in the company is a task in itself as many in management do not continue to move up.

The company tries to keep its employees upbeat and yearning to help customers.",3,Current Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Wichita, KS",8/4/18,2018,8,4
"A good starter job, meh for better","Through Walmart I've gained experience in quite a few different areas which is a great thing.

Positive company experience.,"I'm a people person and love seeing my regular customers, watching their children grow. Seeing people come in for their regular weekly or daily trip.

Not a bad place to work short term,"A day of work was simple, I would check what food was needed on the wall, I would go in the back and find what I need (using a hand computer), I would put the ""sell by"" stickers on everything going out, and I would stock everything. This was 90% of the work. I was usually closing so I would spend the last thirty minutes to an hour cleaning and sanitizing the back area._x000D__x000D_The biggest problem is at Walmart, new employees will be hired part time. They do not like to keep people on at full time, because then they would have to give benefits to more people. Wal-Mart seems to prefer to hire new people and pay them at starting salary part-time than to have people working full time. I would only recommend working here if you are content at only being part time without benefits.",3,Former Employee,Meat Associate ,"Corydon, IN",8/4/18,2018,8,4
Fun work place,"Greet customers, Check them out, Help them load items on check out area, Bag items, Zone area that I work in, Make sure area is clean at all times, Help customers find items.",5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Trumann, AR",8/4/18,2018,8,4
Active place to work,"A normal work day at Walmart is fairly fast paced. Depending on what you\re doing, the day might go by quickly for you. Everyone's first few days will be full of sitting on a computer and learning how to do your job, on that computer. Co workers are very diverse along with the customers. I like that I can get along with most workers that are on my shift. The hardest part of the job can be the customers but you have to do your best to deal with them. Management was always on and off. we get new managers maybe every 6 or 8 months. A lot of the times, employees didn't stay at the job for very long so schedules were always up and down.",4,Current Employee,CASHIER ,"Oklahoma City, OK",8/4/18,2018,8,4
Walmart,"I was working there as a cart pusher and I love the job but when I told my boss that I was moving, he didn’t want to change my work schedule from night shift to morning shift so I had to leave because I didn’t have any transportation and plus the bus stop running around 8 pm.",4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Little Rock, AR",8/4/18,2018,8,4
They can be relaxed yet very stressful,Walmart managers are uncaring about the employees. Sick time is non existent and Dr's excuses are not excepted. The pay rate is good in my area you start at 10.00 and go up to 11.00 within the first 15 months then you get a raise based on performance each year,3,Former Employee,Fabric associate ,"Bogalusa, LA",8/4/18,2018,8,4

Not easy,"You have to do a lot on your own with. no training. It's not easy but if you do you do your best you can go far. Express your ideas to improve, but don't be upset if they get turned down. Honestly your career advancement depends on you and no one else. It is not an easy job no matter what department, so if you want easy do not bother applying. The store, associates and customers are amazing, but of course you still get rude people. I don't agree with some corporate decisions because they want more money for less work. I'm not trying to say bad things about them. I just wish they would go on undercover boss. Corporate does not understand what needs done on the sales floor, and does not understand the corners that management cuts to be able to get things done.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Alliance, OH",8/4/18,2018,8,4

Depends on you,"I was just a regular cashier at Walmart, just graduated High School at the time and working was working two jobs.

Worst experience I've ever had with management. coworkers are awesome, but managers micro manage and complain when people aren't working fast enough in 120 degree trucks in the middle of the summer.

A good job if you have no other experience.,"If you have never worked before or have little experience Walmart is a good place to go, the pay you get for the experience required is really good but you won't have a set schedule more than likely, and at times you can get overrun by customers and it can be really stressful.

Walmart,"Walmart was my first paid job right out of high school. I had no work experience and through my three year tenure there, I was considered a jack of all trades where I was a cashier, cart pusher, covered multiple departments at once, shoe department associate, online management and my final position was truck unloader/inventory specialist. One thing that I learned from working there was my appreciation for work.

"It's a job, but not a career.","I'm sure it depends on the store... but working in grocery side in my store- it's pretty bad. Too many managers, all telling you different things. There's no communication. There's never enough help, and everyone is always calling in- because they don't like it here either. The pay is decent for a retail place, and they have good benefits. But as far as liking your job or being proud of your job- you definitely don't get that here. It's okay for a while, but if you stay long enough... you turn into the grouchy old cashier that has basically become the mascot that embodies a life spent working big box retail.",3,Former Employee,Deli Sales Associate ,IL,8/3/18,2018,8,3

Only work here if its your last resort,Definitely not the best place to work. The management is definitely not the greatest. Customers and employees were never really taken care of. Its a really hard to move up if you are a good worker and the stress is through the roof having to deal with the clientele that shops there and their demanding demeanor.

"Poor management at Walmart in Madison Heights, Virginia",The management is the worst from top to bottom. They can’t even make a schedule to compensate for the customers.

Complicated,"Walmart was a decent place to work but when it came to all their rules about attendance and management, it was too much for me.

Exp: 1pt for missing your shift and a 1/2pt for being late. Well, I recently got in a care accident and ended up not being able to come to work and I got up to 5 1/2pts and they did nothing to help me. They said fill this form out for leave of absence and good luck. Well it got rejected and I got fired.

Decent place to work if Your Looking for something short-term.,"First off , on a typical day at Walmart I would come in and speak to everyone. Get the intructions of the task at hand and grab the team to work on that particular task. Second , the one thing I’ve learned while working at Walmart is that it is every man for themselves. I say that to say this , it’s really hard to trust anybody including the managers. However , the workplace culture is decent more enthusiasm could help while working on the job. Furthermore , the hardest thing about working at Walmart was understanding which manager you could trust with certain information. Lastly , as far as the one thing I enjoyed about Walmart it had to be communicating with the customers on a daily basis. I loved communicating and engaging with different customers because each and every customer has their own personally , encluding the kid/babies.",5,Current Employee,Sales Floor Associate Trainer ,"Dallas, TX",8/3/18,2018,8,3

"If one wants to advance, it seems it is who one knows and not how one works.","It is an okay place to work. Problem is too many people that do not seem to care, and then management does not make the right people accountable. The ones who do little are not held accountable and the ones that work hard are given more to do. Plus the hard workers are then held accountable for what they could not do, because of the overabundance of work they are given. Lack of training is a big problem, not oonly with management. There are a few of us that will help others to succeed. It seems many are afraid of losing their position or have an insecurity.

Fast paced work environment in high-volume stores,"If you work at a high-volume store almost ALL positions within the facility will be very busy whether engaging with customers directly or making the engine run behind the scenes. I've worked my way through a few different positions within my store starting with a Cashier. From there I dabbled in layaway and helped with other projects essentially as a 'floater' until I became an Electronics and Photo Sales Associate. A couple years later I tried my hand as an Auto Care Department Manager and really enjoyed it. Although it could be stressful, I learned so much valuable information and many transferrable skills. About two years into this position I had made the decision to go back to school and to my surprise my Store Manager was eager to work with me. I told him I didn't feel comfortable remaining a Department Manager while restarting school and he promptly transferred me to Claims where coincidentally a new position had just been opened. As a Claims Associate I have a fairly set schedule and am constantly busy and learning new things. The moves that I've made really let me explore what type of work I enjoy doing the most and generally management wants to help you find that out as well, so long as you're a hard worker and a team player. That being said, from my experience, management and workplace culture is highly variable depending on your store and who works there.

A job for the strong willed,"Walmart is great company if you do not progress into the Manager role and if you are solely looking for benefits. The management team is never trained on how to lead.

Not a terrible job,It was an okay job. We were always getting new management though so that was annoying. the job was pretty stressful and they expected us to work very fast.  I really enjoyed working with my team members and I felt like they knew how to make the time go by faster. The typical day at work consists of unloading trucks. we did it very fast that was my least favorite thing to do. After unloading the trucks everybody went to go stock shelves.

There was always sales going on not only in our store but we price matched so we needed to be aware of those sales as well. At times is was hard to get a mangers attention due to other cashiers needs. However they were quick to help or fix what needed  to be done.

Terrible place to work,Walmart does not care about the well being of their associates.

Didn't like forced sales approach.  Pay and compensation package not very could and not considered a living wage.,2,Former Employee,TLE Associate ,"Muncie, IN",8/1/18,2018,8,1
Only good in theory,Management is the entire issue with this place. If the management was as nice in every store as it is in those in Arkansas things would be fine. _x000D_They don't seem to care much about the work schedule for students or for those of parents._x000D_They use a point system that condemns their employees when life issues happen and very few managers would be willing to try and fix it.,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Denton, TX",8/1/18,2018,8,1
Terrible,What can I say it’s Walmart basically this job is nothing but a circus you won’t or can’t advance unless you’re related or kissing you know what all the older people hates on the younger people that’s coming in because they know they’ll lose their job. Managers sleeping with employees and all type of bs going on the pay sucks and the hours are okay when you work nights cuz you don’t have managers hovering over you.

review summary,"Wonderful co-workers at the walmart I was at. Managers I had several of them. It was 50/50. Half were amazing and considerate and Half were jerks but that's about the same as the co-workers. The culture I felt like it was amazing because we all pulled together in the company. The Pay was not bad we got a raise ever year. The area I lived is was significantly more than the pay to live alone. Moving up or job advancement seemed difficult, as it seems you get pidgeon wholed into a position. Once word gets out you are good at a position, the company seems to want to keep you at that same position even if you would like to take steps to move up",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Middle Island, NY",8/1/18,2018,8,1
It is a productive and learning experience,As an automotive technician and a bay supervisor I deal with various types of customers.

Fine company to work for in the short term,"The pay is fine, offering more than most other locations in the area. That being said, management is very hit or miss as are fellow employees. Hours are subject to change (based on how well sales are doing for that store). For Cap 1 Associates, a typical day is going in at 4 am to discuss your work load for the day with your supervisor and then getting to work.

Don't work for Walmart,"Walmart is not a place for you to build and grow a career. As a corporation, they are not concerned with its associates. They make it seem that way until they find a new way to go after Amazon and will do whatever it takes including destroying associates' lives in the process. From a local standpoint, unless you are proficient with deception, you will not go far. Too many unqualified associates are getting promoted over more deserving and qualified candidates because of this._x000D_Please be careful if you decide to work for Walmart. They do not train new managers very well. You are expected to know everything even if you have little to no experience with the company. You will work long hours. Your schedule may be 7-5 but you will be required to work until your job is done- no matter how unrealistic the job my be.

Physically demanding,"They pull you in with the 'high' pay rate but when the math is said and done, you are making about $13 per hour. Work day is based on volume. Having said this, pay consistently fluctuates and is hard to budget around if its not during the business season (tax and holiday time). Management is hit and miss. Sometimes they have well trained managers and coaches, and other times they don't seem to know anything but the basics. There also seems to be a favorites system in which those who pull beyond production levels are treated with more entitlements and favors than those at production or those who fall in between. As an order filler, you are trained in what's called ""green zone lifting"". This is basic knowledge on how to properly lift objects of heavier weights. However, even with these techniques, the amount of lifting done in the time of the shift is well beyond the normal capacity in which most cannot sustain for any prolonged amount of time. The pay does not make up for the amount of bodily stress that one has to endure nor the risk of serious, debilitating injuries that can occur.",3,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Ochelata, OK",7/31/18,2018,7,31

men were allowed to belittle or ridicule women and minorities and were never asked to cover more than 1 department,"was pleasant working there but not enough help. worked 3 depts. and was asked to help with more when and if I finished the 3: hardware, tire lube and express (automotive) sporting goods",3,Former Employee,Inventory Control Specialist ,"Amarillo, TX",7/31/18,2018,7,31
Okay to start with,"It paid better than waitressing and was more willing to work with my school schedule. However the overall manager I had was very poor in performance and it felt like he would personally try to undermine employees by talking down to them or complain about productivity, then refuse to help struggling employees. However, he was replaced, and the manager who took his place was amazing for the few days I had worked with him. I suppose it all depends on store locations, I would suggest talking to current employees of which ever location you are considering to get a better view of the store before applying. If the management is bad, its not worth it, but my department manager, and support manager were both excellent, despite the head manager of the store",2,Former Employee,Fresh Foods Associate ,"Susanville, CA",7/31/18,2018,7,31
Okay place to work,"Walmart is an okay business to work for. Besides being understaffed, work can be fairly smooth. You may have a customer or few who can be quite rude.

I enjoyed working for Walmart. People I worked with kept me motivated.,"Typical work day is structured. We follow the protocol or everything by the book. There would be no confusion. I learned a lot about my employees and how to motivate them. If you care about your employees...when you are not there, they will take care of you and the business. The culture at Walmart is quality over quantity. There check points and security protocols to protect patient safety is effective. The hardest part of the job is earning the respect from my employees in the beginning. It took me a year to prove to them I can be a great leader. I did that by showing them the biggest employee bonus they received. My most enjoyable part of my job is to take all my employees out every year for Christmas and Thanksgiving.

Most are laidback and productive, others are stressful and lazy. For example, I had a department manager who caused stress and drama within the workplace and often had people do her work for her; however, most of the people that I had worked with and for have been helpful and willing to be productive with our time. The environment can be stressful due to the amount of people, customers and employees, coming in and out of the place. With this being said, I have heard many other people talk about how stressful their job is compared to mine, so I have learned not to be concerned about the type of job that I have.",3,Current Employee,Apparel Sales Associate ,"Columbus, IN",7/30/18,2018,7,30

Walmart is a good job for time time workers.,I started at Walmart. It was my first job and I’ve been there two years. There have been a lot of changes since then. Some of the changes are beneficial and others aren’t so much. But there is nothing you can do about it except do your job. I wouldn’t say it’s a bad place but I just don’t see myself staying there long.,3,Current Employee,Walmart Sales Associate ,"Port Allen, LA",7/30/18,2018,7,30
Work life balance and team work.,It's hard to judge all walmart's the same as some run the store according to the vision and value of it's employees and management. But unfortunately the ones I worked at had issues. The first one I worked at valued the employees and controlled turnover. However found many upper management in the back in corners crying due to verbal abuse. At the second one there was a revolving door for employees. Turnover was off the chain. No proper training or proper equipment for them to do their job properly. A lot of favoritism and clicks with upper management. Also was common to work 14 plus hours per day and sometimes 9 days straight. Also would be called in on days off.,3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,Virginia,7/30/18,2018,7,30
You Are Better Off Unemployed,"-Let's start off with the lies. _x000D_They tell you from the beginning that Unions are bad and they will only hurt you. That's a lie. I now have a Unionized job and I have no complaints with it. _x000D_They also tell you from the beginning that getting moved up in the company happens pretty quickly. Absolute lie. I was kept - almost forcefully - in the same entry level position for 3 years. And afterwards I would get asked multiple times if I wanted to go back to my original position. _x000D_I was told by a store manager that I would be getting a pay raise which I never saw. Another lie. _x000D_-Cashiers. Not that many of them had the best customer service skills, but this particular Walmart doesn't consider cashiers to be necessary at all. They replaced many of their cashiers with self-scanning machines._x000D_-Staffing. They go through so many inner city ghetto teen moms and hoodlums that it completely buries the genuine workers who are actually trying. As a result, there is no sense of teamwork or trust anywhere. Everyone is out to one-up the other. The good workers get targeted and made fun of so the bad ones can get their foot in the door. Every single day, you can expect fighting and cursing._x000D_-Management. Just. Wow. There are no words to give it justice. The managers are so full of themselves, they think they are running a palace instead of a shabby Walmart. They are no more qualified to be in their position than the rest of the staff is. They will guilt trip you for something really tiny. But there are certain rules of human respect that they themselves don't properly follow._x000D__x000D_Working here - more...",1,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Warminster, PA",7/30/18,2018,7,30
Career Stagnate,"It's hard to describe a typical day for Walmart as all positions are different from hourly to salary. I've been lucky enough to hold both types of positions. With the ever changing environment that Walmart holds, you have to be adaptable and go with the change. One of the hardest things to do is accepting the constant change and the stress that comes along with it. I've enjoyed my time with Walmart; however, I've reached a point in my career in which I've become stagnate and there are not enough opportunities for me to continue my career in the field in which I am passionate and knowledgeable about.

Which by itself would be fine but i worked mostly in housewares in a Walmart that catered to a lot of people where many customers like to open products to visually inspect or demo them and then not put them back in the boxes. A lot of my time was spent trying to put pots and pans sets, kitchen utensils, and appliances back in their boxes the the very specific way they have to be so you could close them. So while i did this i was expected to clean up my section, collect go backs, help customers and restock product for the first hour or two that should have been done the night before which would take me away from my other duties and special projects that had to be done. I would get hassled about not having everything perfect by other department managers while my own promised that they were going to hire more people for the department to help out which never happened.",2,Former Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Los Angeles, CA",7/30/18,2018,7,30

dont work here,"Depending on the store you get hired at, that will provide your view of this company. Some stores have good management, good employees, and excellent teamwork skills. However, for some of us who weren't lucky enough to get hired at a store with decent management, you have this: A store manager who will go out of their way to sabotage advancement within the company if it will be an inconvenience to them. A co-manager who will tell you to let them know of any problems you have, but when you do, it's suddenly impossible to find them to see if there can be a resolution. An Assistant Manager who will go out of their way to make you feel incapable of your job, because of setbacks you can't control. You get a management staff that will push you to step down because you are too vocal of the obstacles you need help with, ones who just want you to say you'll get it done, regardless of if it's physically possible for you to do it. They will alienate you, degrade you, push you to do things that aren't part of your job. Understaff your department so that you're so busy doing everyone else's job, you can't do yours.

So working for the store my responsibilities were to sweep the entire store make sure all the vestibules look good and no trash laying in the parking lot so if it wasn't for me and other day maintenance that store probably would have not survived the clean fast and friendly ratings so working for Walmart was good,3,Former Employee,Day maintnace/ cashier ,"Nixa, MO",7/29/18,2018,7,29

"Incredibly fun and flexible, manager affects your job greatly","Walmart offers great benefits for both full- and part-time workers. The job is usually very fun and straightforward. The breaks were great; you get 2 paid 15 minute breaks and a not paid hour long lunch, if you are working a typical 8 hour day. They don't allow overtime for bottom-line workers like cashiers and stockers, and it is avoided as much as possible in managerial positions. The raises were fair and frequent enough. The only downside is the amount of control management has over your morale, but if there are any serious problems, HR is great about correcting corruption. There is a 10% discount on taxable items all year, and on groceries during the holiday season.

Wouldn't recommend; Cons outweigh the Pros,"TL;DR: If you don't mind being treated like a second-class citizen and working for a company who cares very little about you, all on minimum wage, then this is the job for you! _x000D__x000D_This job is emotionally and physically draining, let me explain. _x000D__x000D_First off, management is one of the poorest I have ever had to tolerate with. I started out as a cashier and later on I still had to do cashier and customer service duties which is easily the worst task. Often the amount of cashiers they have scheduled for the day isn't enough to combat the growing demand at checkers (as angry, impatient customers so generously remind you), and sometimes there are more cashiers than necessary leaving many cashiers to try and look busy to avoid harassment by their managers and customers who are all too happy to proclaim someone as lazy and undeserving of a minimum wage job. Yes, management will try to correct any problems and they are very forgiving, but many of times more problems arise when they are solved because all they do is shift resources to solve problems on hand; much like moving bricks from one side of the house to fill a hole.They will accommodate you if you are not feeling well like when I had to surgery on my foot they gave me a stool to sit on. When I first started working there many of the managers followed procedure to the best of their abilities; now, I would be lucky to get customer service help or sent home on time.

A good job,A typical day at Walmart is just that a typical day. You do your task and go home. Working there I learned how to be a team leader and the importance of that leadership. I lead a team of 12-18 associates whom i teach and trained to become better and some became managers and supervisors because of that. The management at Walmart especially my store where great. They did not play favorites and there was no nepotism of any kind. As long as you did your task and where polite and respectful they where the same way. Good people. The culture at Walmart was like no other. It has all walks of life there and that's one of the main things I loved about it. Made good friends there. The hardest part of the job was the 2 truck days plus some 2 tuck days we had a small crew which made it impossible to get everything done. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a team leader. I cared about my team they're the back bone of the whole place. The hardest working women and men I've ever had the pleasure to work with. The owner of the store is a good man and Walmart is the only place that seen potential in me and gave me a fair shot to make more for myself and my family i will never forget that.,4,Former Employee,Supervisor/Manager ,"Hannibal, MO",7/26/18,2018,7,26

Associates got along and management treated the Associates with respect and courtesy. The Everett store however was a cut-throat from Management on down to the newest employees. We were not treated with respect at that store which made the workday longer and most times miserable. With so many Associates from diverse backgrounds our culture was a mixture of values, beliefs, behaviors and attitudes. This I thought was a good thing because it taught me how to relate to a diversity of different cultures which helped when relating to the Associates and our customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who are rude because their agenda was not met.

Great Job/Terrible changes,Working for Wal-Mart is great but the Corporate changes have made this job not too favorable if you aren't a manager of more. Recently they rolled out a new scheduling system that allows you to set in your hours for 3 months. Great right? Wrong what they aren't saying is that anyone who has full-time employment and benefits will loose their full-time status because they offer the associate well under the required 35hrs a week to keep your status. So you now have to scramble to find the rest of your hours somewhere else in the store while your main dept. suffers from the lack of coverage.,2,Current Employee,Sales Representative/Personal Shopper ,"Mentor, OH",7/24/18,2018,7,24

"Great work environment, low pay","Walmart has a great work culture. A typical day would last 7-8 hours with 2 15 minute breaks and 1 hour lunch.

Extremely Stressful,"Walmart wasn't bad when I first started, but the last few years were miserable. It became an unbearable work environment. Associates and managers were very negative. They say there's room to advance at Walmart.....yeah right. It all depends on who you are. If you're not a suck up, you go no where fast. That's not even the half of it.  It finally got so bad, I would cry on my way to work because I knew what I was headed in to. Glad they cut my hours from 32/week to 8 every other week. Gave me a chance to get out of there.",2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Elkhart, IN",7/24/18,2018,7,24
A Good Temporary Job,I would typically work 8 hour shifts and in those 8 hours I had to clean up my area(i usually either worked in housewares and domestics for apparel and infants) and make sure nothing was on the floor or out of place and I had to put away returned items for that area.,4,Former Employee,Associate ,"Kenosha, WI",7/24/18,2018,7,24
Meat grinder. Not fun. Got to where I dreaded going to work.,"While Walmart pays it's managers well, I watched the culture change for the worse over the years. Always trying to be all things to all people, telling it's associates to do more with less people, resources, etc. Merchandising was so structured, it took the fun out of being a merchant. They used to tailor their stores to the community, but that went away years ago. They took the personality out of the store, no real feeling of teamwork. Hiring was always in desperation, I called it ""the warm-body syndrome"". Because it was such a meat grinder, the quality of management and hourly associates declined over the years. Most people that work there long-term are stuck in a rut and can't get the same money elsewhere, so they become unhappy and stuck in the role. Look at the faces when you go into the store. No matter how long you work there, or how strong your customer service skills are, no one equates ""Walmart"" with ""excellent customer service"". They paid my bills, but nothing more.",2,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Florida,7/24/18,2018,7,24

Completly unacceptable for a corporation of this size,Literally everything that has to do with day to day functions of this company is a complete and total disaster from logistics to scheduling. There is zero communication between shifts and management is taught to keep shifts divided and pitted against one another as often as possible to keep blame from rolling back onto them (the actual people responsible). From the top to the very bottom the company imply a things roll down hill policy and micromanage whenever possible to minimize accountability. There is no screening process for potential job candidates and the criteria to be hired is literally answering only 1 question,2,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Kingsport,Tn",7/24/18,2018,7,24

Overall not a rewarding place to work,"Much more physically demanding job than you would think. The only way to advance is to become dept mgr, then asst mgr and so on. The problem with that is you see how they are treated, and it all flows downhill from there. Big retail is what it is, only rewarding for the people at or near the top of the pyramid. No one other than your immediate co-workers cares about you as a person, the bigger the company the less you are treated fairly.",2,Former Employee,"Sales Associate, Produce Department ","Knoxville, TN",7/24/18,2018,7,24

One of the better community pharmacies!,"Walmart Pharmacy got their goals right. I've met with the SVP several times and I can tell that the upper management figured out what good leadership is. The pharmacy gets busy; however, it's possible to have an efficient workday with properly trained technicians.

Fun work environment,Walmart is a fast  Pace place it has good benefits if you’re hard on and not through a temp agency. Even though you go to a temp agency they do compensated very well. The only thing about it is it’s a temporary job so it only last 3 to 4 months until the holidays are over. What I’ve learned at Walmart the time I did work there was always have a back up plan because you never know when It’s time for you to move again. The job is very enjoyable you’re just not secured a position.,4,Former Employee,Picker and Packer ,"Fort Worth, TX",7/24/18,2018,7,24

Though they always made sure we got lunch, due to fact they didn't want us to sue them. I learned that Walmart tries to brainwash you to think that unions are a bad thing because they'll take care of you and they'll never do anything to take advantage of you.

My Opinion,Wal-Mart is a big company that is very successful. They work hard to improve every year with the help from their employees. I started almost 5 years ago. Every year there are layoffs. The amount of pay has stayed the same and the company keeps increasing the amount of sales every year. At the shareholders meeting they announced how well the company is doing.

Poor,"When you start at Walmart, they tell you that its a family. This is a lie. It isn't until after you've started your job that you learn the truth.

This was made evident to me quickly after I started. As an overnight cashier I'm also expected to stock the ""impulse"" items that are placed at the registers. I run the Self Check Out section and am told I can not leave my post, but am still expected to get the items stocked on ALL registers. I'm expected to lift boxes that are 30-50 pounds, even though I'm pregnant. When I brought this up to management, I was told ""Well, that's what you need to do, figure it out. We had a girl on the stock team that was pregnant and she was able to lift that.""

Poor management and communication at times.,"The whole purpose of me working at Wal-Mart was to work in electronics.

I've asked if I can move to electronics multiple times... Instead, they need help in Toys still... If they want more help in toys, they should say theres no space in Electronics like they did to me and move them in to toys, and move someone who has been waiting patiently, who has shown interest since they arrived. You know, maybe a person like me?

All while zoning, taking care of the customers, doing top stock and running up to the register when they call for it. It can be pretty hectic especially if it's a weekend or a holiday is coming up. It depends on the day of the week whether or not the store will be busy and what kind of coverage we will have. My coworkers make my day so much more enjoyable. I've been with the company 10 years and yeah I've had my ups and downs but for the most part, it's truly not a bad place to work.",4,Current Employee,Stocker/Cashier ,"Vineland, NJ",7/22/18,2018,7,22

Can be productive if everyone work together and there's their fair share.,"Lately Walmart have the hiring people who wants to get paid but not do their job , they have employees coming in making the same or more than employees who have already been there that is very unfair to the current employee who has to train these new employees._x000D_We as as_x000D_sociates at Walmart have realize that managers are very hard on the associates who come in and do the job to the best of their ability and go above and beyond to help cover those Associates were there just to collect the check, for those employees were there in just to collect the check they don't say much to them just allow them to go about their day and constantly asking those employees to do their best to do more",3,Current Employee,Meat Sales Associate ,South Carolina,7/22/18,2018,7,22

The management was nice,I worked for Wal-Mart over 4years had no problems everyone treated me nice. Left because I needed more money and benefits!The company was good for me it was pastime work and the location was great from my house.

The Mcdonald's of department/grocery stores,"I've definitely had many worse jobs, but I've also had a couple that were better. The turnover is high for a reason. They pay better than a lot of places now at Walmart, but the work environment is exhausting. Never before have I felt more like I was expected to complete my duties, ""with or without reasonable accommodations"". You're expected to work hard, work fast, and get everything asked of you done in your 8 hour shift. Regardless of the changing everyday conditions of your job.Trying to communicate properly with management about scheduling issues, faulty equipment, lack of resources and other problems on the job can be confusing, tediously drawn out, and rather stressful.",3,Former Employee,Store Associate ,"DeKalb, IL",7/22/18,2018,7,22

Work as a team,Working there is always a blast always training new guys and gals to the team of the Walmart and always there to help customers when they need the help the more you work the better you become at what your working with and what your doing out there at the store it’s always a blast.,4,Former Employee,Sale Associate ,"Eagle River, AK",7/21/18,2018,7,21
Management was very good to the employees.,Job Security was thought to be very secure until one night when my whole crew was walked to the door to get aid off. No prior knowledge of this coming.,5,Current Employee,Associate in finishing department ,"Crawfordsville, IN",7/21/18,2018,7,21
Temporary basis only,"It's hard to say everything that happens in a workday here. It consists of ringing up customers, handling cash, bagging, and general maintenance upfront. If you work in a fresh department you could be doing deli; slicing meats and cheeses, doing rotisserie chicken and oven-fried foods, or baking breads and cookies. Fresh departments also had to pull products from fridge and freezers to stock. Overnights stocked the floor and you worked independently so that's a plus. However, Walmart is the number one user of social benefits in the US despite being a very fortunate multi-national retailer. They tell you your store will bonus and there's profit sharing but that all depends on your store and the duration of your employment there. They also don't trust you to have a discount card until after 3 months of employment. The culture lacks, and not enough pay.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Cook ,"Simi Valley, CA",7/21/18,2018,7,21
Would not recommend or refer a friend to work here.,"Some days are fun. Most are very hectic & your ability to get your own duties done are constantly interrupted by other co-workers & management demands on your time. You get sent to other departments constantly on a daily basis to either bail them out or do someone else's work because they called off, etc or are unable to perform their own job duties,etc. You receive sporatic direction from your immediate manager most of the time because he is getting yanked to another department, etc or trying to get his own work done. Upper management operates on basis of 'it's a body' instead of this person can be trained properly to succeed. Employee turnover is extremely high. Workload distribution is poor. Many 'slackers' survive only because they are some managers 'pet'. Most management look out for themselves & their ""pets"". Instead of there being 'no 'I in team'; there 'is a 'me' in team'.There is very little, if any unity as a cohesive team working for the same goal.",2,Current Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Wilton, NY",7/21/18,2018,7,21
job for desperate people,The hardest part of this job is dealing with the people that come through walmart. The rest is fairly easy and you get two 15 minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch,2,Current Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Plano, TX",7/21/18,2018,7,21
It all depends on management.,Wal-Mart will give almost anyone a chance in employment. It's really up to you to keep your job. The only thing though is they give re-hires a hard with coming back. Most of them won't get a call back.,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Los Angeles, CA",7/21/18,2018,7,21

Hectic but helped me grow as a person,"A typical day at work consisted of managing the lines at the checkouts, handling customer complaints, and completing all of my tasks even when short staffed. The hardest part of the job was having no coverage ever. Management did not seem to enjoy helping the Customer Service Managers, mainly because we have more knowledge about the registers and the store policies than they did. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers and doing everything that I could to help them leave happy and satisfied. I learned a lot about responsibility, patience and understanding, and how to handle upset customers. I also learned a lot about how registers, cash machines, and computers work.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"San Angelo, TX",7/21/18,2018,7,21

It’s Walmart,I’m truely grateful for the opportunity to obtain my cpht through Walmart and a somewhat flexible schedule for school aside from that i left work crying pretty much every day because the patients are just nasty. Majority of my day was spent as a cashier and not actually filling prescriptions. I was never offered benefits even though i was working full time hours for over 6 months even when i went to inquire about my benefits they said my manager had to put me in the system as a full time employee which if you know anything about Walmart they hate doing that. My friends were making wayyyy more working for other companies and had been working in the field for the same amount of time. Overall avoid the company... avoid any retail pharmacy for that matter. If you are absolutely desperate and want to get your Cpht license for free go for it.,2,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Miami, FL",7/21/18,2018,7,21
Schedule Flexibility,"Overall this was a good job especially since it was my first job while attending college yet, I always had problems with my schedule, and I was a student for most of the time. Their training for pharmacy staff is bad. I feel they should completely change the training and not place too much limit of technicians while in the pharmacy concerning wallets, and types of drinks to drink during your shift (we can't take anything but water to drink throughout our shift in the pharmacy, and nothing bigger than a basic water bottle size).",3,Current Employee,Registered Pharmacy Technician ,"Edinburg, TX",7/21/18,2018,7,21

Hard working job with a fair pay,Walmart is an unattractive job in terms of the job description and demanding hours but has a lot of great managers and coworkers.

I didn't learn much at Walmart unlike my other jobs but I believe it brought out the best in me and taught me a lot of life lessons.,3,Current Employee,Logistics Support Staff ,"Watchung, NJ",7/21/18,2018,7,21
"Great Mission, Terrible Execution","As a former Assistant Store Manager, I know that Walmart---as a company--has great policies for employees and customers, a great focus on progress, and goes through great lengths to test and implement improvements. That's all awesome;  but it means almost nothing when in-store management is plagued by incompetency and flat-out idiocy. I started off in a great store with a good store manager. He followed policies and was fair. He set the tone for the other managers, who were pretty good to customers and employees. He helped me move up into management by giving me opportunities to learn new skills. Unfortunately, most management is garbage. Most have their own interpretations of policies, botch things up, blame the subordinate  employees, and wonder why they have call-outs and high turnover. Regional management and higher needs to do some sort of ""undercover boss"" type of thing nationwide, keeping hourly employees anonymous. Heads would roll from salaried store management teams.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Cromwell, CT",7/21/18,2018,7,21

Can be rewarding yet very stressful,"Working with the public can be rewarding and also very infuriating. Some people are very nice, caring and appreciative.

The hardest part is management wanting yes-people not people with a voice._x000D_Walmart thinks a computer making the assocaites schedule works when in real life it doesn't They have tried this multiple times and each time it has not worked.

It's a lot of work,just a lot to do not enough staff and time to do it but you better make sure its 100%.  Some days are better than others but lately things have been slowly going downhill.

I find ways to make stressful days fun, by being myself. I was able to grow quick with the company despite the atmosphere. I would have to say the hardest part of the job is when there is no communication. And that leads to a lot of upset workers. I simply keep a smile on my face and try to make everyone else smile too, from co-workers to customers.

"It's retail, you are not going to be okay with a negative attitude","In a nutshell, my job is to make sure the front-end runs smoothly while handling an ever changing and fast-paced work environment (unless you happen to work at a low volume store).  Registers are running low on money, I will get them more money. A customer needs help for any reason, I will assist them or delegate to another associate. Customer emergencies, price checks, key turns and overrides, making confident decisions when denying and approving questionable returns for some reason while following policy, etc. I learned how to discipline and give constructive critique to my associates.  It's all about the attitude you show your co-workers and customers. If you look stressed the cashiers with be stressed, if a customer can tell you're in a bad mood they will be snappy with you too.  I have very few memorable encounters with my customers compared to co-workers in my same position. It's psychology.  As with management, communication in key, they won't know what you need if you don't talk. On the other hand, they can't comply with every request you make, they must treat everyone fairly and equally especially during the holidays.  The hardest part of the job is having to juggle and remember like 10 things at a time especially when it's busy and upper management is nagging at you that you have long lines like you didn't already know but you are stuck at the service desk dealing with an upset customer and there are ""customer emergency"" requests coming into your handheld from the cashiers.

"The job pays fairly well competitively and, assuming competent management and proper workforce, the work culture is fairly decent and relaxed.","Typical Day: Depending on staffing, customer numbers, and management, the typical day is fairly relaxed and mundane.

Too much sometimes,"Walmart has interesting people that range from the kind hearted to the cold blooded. I honestly don't think they care about the individual employees. They are, face value, to customers, good people but I've seen such cold hearted natures to individual employees and they were so quick to cut the throats of those trying to maintain two jobs. Its a good job for higher ups and maybe people who are starting but for those looking for a career must be ready to go through hardships. If you are lucky you will have a kind and understanding supervisor. As for the daily work, it is fair and understandable.

We didn't do anything fun really.,Well a regular day at work I would unload trucks first. Then after the truck we would go to grocery receiving and work on the frieght over there. Then when we finish the grocery receiving side we do GM side and work on that side. Then pull fresh frieght to the proper departments. I learned that this Walmart job was a easy one. What made it more difficult is when the customers get rude and the employees. We had a manager for a long time then they switched him to another store but then we didn't have no manager all we had was supervisors. The hardest part of the job was the black Friday sales.

customer service,"Walmart is a large company, anywhere from gorceries, electronics to clothing can be found there.

"great associates, management needs work, corporate needs to come to earth.","I loved working for Walmart at first and told my zone manager I wanted to be a CSM, but nobody would train me and no matter how hi I went nothing happened. I heard Walmart was about the opportunity but I didn't experience that at all. Pushing credit cards and programs customers don't want to be heckled about isn't right either. So many customers told me they were glad that I didn't ask them about credit cards, because they don't want them or have other ones that do way more for them. Plus it's rude to heckle people about the same stuff day in and day out. I think Corporate needs to visit on the store level as well because some of the new programs that came out weren't helpful and more ridiculous and made our jobs harder, and the customers more aggravated. Hourly associates don't think corporate understands them and honestly, it felt like all they cared about was profit, with no regard for the associates. I think saving money makes it possible to live better like Sam Walton wanted and I love shopping at Walmart because its cheaper for the most part but working there wasn't that great.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,Medf,7/19/18,2018,7,19

has it ups and downs,"Experiences at Walmart vary from store to store/Manager to Manager. I worked at 5 Walmart's and only liked 1 out of the 5. One store had a terrible store manager always in his office never on the sales floor unless a visit from the market manager or above. He lied and had his favorites. He was later demoted to an assistant and sent to another store. The management team was terrible except for 1 assistant. There was many older aged women working as department managers that were like old hens. They were mean and did not deserve to be DM's. There was cliques in the store that reminded me of high school. One assistant would sneak around and spy on associates and try to get them fired. She ended up getting fired after some of us complained about her with an open door to the market manager because the store manager liked her and covered her. The one nice manager mentored me and helped me become promoted to an assistant manager._x000D_ The best store I worked at the store manager was out driving forklifts, pulling pallet jacks, stocking and just working as he was one of us. He treated everyone fairly and didn't have any favorites as I could tell. The store had a great management team that worked with associates and treated us all nice. They would always help you without asking them. I really enjoyed my time there. Everyone helped each other and worked as a team and had a good time. The store manager was transferred to open up a new store and a few of the managers transferred later on, then I left about the same time so don't know what happened to the store after that._x000D__x000D_This just goes - more...",1,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Milwaukee, WI",7/19/18,2018,7,19

Decent place to work,"A typical day at Walmart starts for a stalker seeing how the number of items you must throw to the floor by the end of the night. Typically throwing between 600 to 1900 pieces. Not including features and bulk items, the pace at which management wants the freight thrown is 60 cases an hour. You do how ever get two 15mins breaks during your shift first one at 2 hours into your shift, and the second break 2 hours from the end of your shift. also, as a full timer with working over 8 hours you receive an hour lunch at about 4 to 5 hours into your shift. I have learned plenty of skills; such as time management, critical problem solver, team work. Walmart does have a great workplace culture of hard work, teamwork. Management can be both great and terrible at the same time.

The only reason this was possible however is because we were understaffed and the didn't want to hire anyone. In turn, I was always getting pulled to do someone else's job and couldn't finish my own, but they would get upset if you worked overtime.

They will not even try to provide a semi-regular schedule, I once worked for 10 days straight with no days off alternating between early mornings and late nights and because of how the pay period fell I didn't get over part time and they were still covered by me having 4 days in a pay period.

"Friendly, slow-paced work environment, geared towards customer service","Stocking at Wal-Mart consists of pulling unboxed products from the backroom to the shopping floor, stocking them in a timely manner, rotating oldest stock to the front, newest stock in back, and 'facing' or organizing the area you are responsible for.

Favorite place I’ve worked at.,"Let me start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoy hard, demanding work. Orderfilling at Walmart is just that. For my particular job, you drive a machine that has two pallets on the back, with a wireless headset that will tell you where in the warehouse your next item is. You will have to pick up that item and put it on your trips. I’ve had one case trips, and I’ve had 360 case trips. That all depends on the randomized system that gives out trips as people request the next one. As a newbie you have 40 hours(usually done in 3 days and a half days) to learn the job with a trainer. After that, you are on your own and have 3 months to be able to pull the numbers they want you to pull. For example, if a trip has been deemed to take 30 minutes. You MUST finish it in 30 minutes to get a 100%. If you finish it faster than 30 minutes you will get a percentage over it, and vise versa if you took longer. They take all of your trips that day and average out what percentage you got for the day. Keep in mind a 300 case trip will obviously dictate your daily percentage more than a trip with just 20 cases.  Most new people will start around 50%-65% for the day. After 3 months you are expected to be able to pull a bare minimum of 100%. If you have a weekly average of less than 100% you will get written up for it, eventually they will walk you out for failing to meet demands. That however, rarely ever happens. Most people will be able to pull the minimum and will be just fine. On the other hand, if you pull over the requested average, you will get a payout every paycheck up to 130%. If you max - more...",5,Current Employee,Orderfiller ,Virginia,7/19/18,2018,7,19

What the Heck,Walmart has completely gone downhill. I cannot believe the way they treat their employees. The CSM's are lazy and stand around when they should be on a register helping since their is only 3 open at a time maybe 7 during the holidays. The managers must have been hired by a family member who worked there because they are slow. Back in the early 2000's this company was the place to be. It was like working with your family.

Environment of Opportunity,"Walmart Inc. gets a bad rap for being an entry-level company where people simply go for part-time work while they're in school that will only last a short while. However, this couldn't be farther from the truth. Walmart offers a multitude of ways for you to carve your own path in the company and achieve great heights. There are plenty of opportunities for promotion and ample resources to get you there. The management truly cares about your future and wish for you to succeed. However, this does not mean it's an easy ride. Every position within every store of the company has plenty of work to do and you will be held to a high standard. As an associate in the fresh area of the store, this couldn't be more true. Every day there was not only high customer traffic as it was the most popular area of the store, but there were a lot of safety and proper food handling laws and rules that had to be followed to a tee. Every day was spent equally stocking, interacting with customers, cleaning, and preparing for every associate to be able to handle the whole day's work load. Management was hard on everyone, not intrusively, but in a way that propelled people to work towards a higher standard of quality in the presentation of product. If you wish to be a Walmart employee, don't go in with the mindset of it being a temporary job. Be ambitious, and you can go far.",4,Former Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Lima, OH",7/19/18,2018,7,19

Sink or Swim,"As an Assistant Manager for WalMart, there was a lot of sink or swim mentality. Because of the shortage of associates, you were constantly ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"".

Walmart has lost itself in money,"The job isn't what it used to be years ago. The idea of Associates having value or meaning is gone. _x000D_ They have eliminated several positions at Walmart. It was a cost saving idea I believe at the expense of the people still there. The company as a whole is having trouble finding Associates willing to move up. _x000D_ Even going as far to tell people (Salaried) that you have 2 years to move up to the next level or quit and take a severance package. The days of 20 year salary people who like their job and want to stay doing what they are doing.. are over. Move up, Or move out. _x000D_ The managers they hire are not Working Managers, which in retail means rolling up your sleeves and working along side the hourly's. When you go to any Walmart you will hardly ever see Management throwing freight or zoning aisles. They have been brainwashed at Academies to have ""Hands Off"" approaches to just about everything._x000D_ I can ramble on more but you get the idea where this review went. All jobs are according to the individual, so you would have to work there to form your own opinion.",2,Current Employee,Cap Team 1 Supervisor ,"Denver, CO",7/18/18,2018,7,18

If you get in a good store you'll enjoy it,"I worked in two stores, the first one was excellent honestly. The first store was very good environment to work in, friendly staff, and overall good experience (80M+ volume). Second store was absolutely horrible (120M+ volume). The second stores staff was not very friendly, no one wanted to help each other, non stop drama, no one took responsibility for anything and just blamed each other for all of the various issues. Constant call outs, extremely high stress store due to it's volume - store consistently makes 500k+ a day even in off season. If you can get into a lower end high volume store, it's going to be fast paced and enjoyable overall. I would avoid extremely high volume stores at all costs, it is not worth the stress, and just all of the toxicity that kind of environment entails. Otherwise the pay is good compared to other entry level retail jobs, if you work hard and are friendly you can advance pretty easily to be quite honest.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Venice, FL",7/18/18,2018,7,18

Lines were typically long (especially evenings), and managers were slow to call department staff for backup on the front-end/checkout.

Walmart,I started working for Walmart when the legacy of Sam Walton and the culture he had built was still fresh. When I started there were Merit Raises and other perks that made it possible for a hard worker to increase one's pay. However with the death of Sam Walton the company grew more and more one sided. Managers pay increased while lower level workers wages remained low and were capped so they could not make more after a certain point. Safety was very poor in many backrooms. I started from the very bottom and through performance and perserverance I was promoted to many different positions. I made sure I cared for all my crew members as much as I could with what little power I had. Walmart's system makes it near impossible to offer any employee any real rewards. After many years of struggling I decided to leave the company. I had many great friends and crew members over the years but it was as though we were all slaves working for uncaring distant malignant masters.,2,Former Employee,Assistant Manager / Logistics Specialist ,"Orange County, CA",7/18/18,2018,7,18

"Used to be a company, is now a joke.","Walmart is a company that sets its employees up to fail. My store has a ""Now Hiring!"" sign up, but doesn't give its current employees enough hours to make ends meet. We had 4 people quit because they weren't getting enough hours. On top of that, we got a new manager that fired 4 people as soon as they walked in the door. The new manager then went on vacation for a week, leaving the rest of us high and dry with 8 fewer people. Our hours were still cut and we weren't allowed overtime during this period. The customers are always angry because our lines are long. On top of that, they changed it so the new hires make at least $11 an hour. That is wonderful for the new hires. Minimum wage in our area is a little over $7. However, I have been at Walmart for 8 years. I have dedicated 8 long years to this company. I now only make $1 more than someone who is just coming in because they didn't increase my wage at all. If you work for Walmart, don't expect to get any Holidays off except Christmas. If you want to spend Thanksgiving with your family, too bad. This last year we had our Black Friday sale at 6 o'clock on Thanksgiving. Every Black Friday there is violence by the way. In an age where everything is electronic, this company can't hold their biggest sale online. They'd rather endanger people. They do offer advancement in the company. All the managers I have started out in an entry level position. But they seem even more stressed out because corporate doesn't give them enough hours to be fully staffed. At this point it seems like I'm rambling, so I think I'll end it here. After 8 - more...",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,Idaho,7/18/18,2018,7,18

Apply here if you are desperate,"By far the most horrible workplace experience I’ve EVER had. I worked here while waiting for my security clearance for my dream job to clear & every second of it was terrible. HR & Upper management will talk about how it’s a team environment, but it is a bunch of lies. You are only a number & will be treated as such. The pay was above average for the area (started off at $16.00, ended at $17.55 at 6 months)but the daily stress of getting written up, treated like a robot with no life, gossiping area managers,and raggedy equipment makes the above average pay not worth it. Consistently high turnover rate because they’d rather hold associates accountable for everything and not their ridiculous policies and procedures. The option to purchase stock & education benefits are the only pros  of working for this dreadful company. They claim safety is “number 1”, yet there are no railings on the spurs and boxes continuously fall around the associates feet no matter how it’s stacked. Work here if you’re in desperate need of a job, but do not settle and continue looking for something better.

The recent added levels of leadership has muddied the waters.  This has caused very inconsistent direction in the field, with my peers and I working for several different goals when we should all work for the same goal.  We have the autonomy to make decisions and lead our business.  Although we may be questioned about a certain decision, our leadership does not punish you for the decision you made as long as you gave a good business reason why.

Walmart was okay with thieves using stolen credit cards,A manager interfered putting my life in danger during an aprehension.

The only bad thing is Walmart does not hire the best managers.

"With the right management, a great place to work.","I don't want to write a review based strictly on the management but i will say that good management makes the job better. There was a recent change to the overall dress code at Walmart that made it much more relaxed. It was the most positive change I had seen them make in my years there. They did away with Holiday pay, sick pay, and vacation pay. Now you aren't compensated AT ALL for working holidays and your sick pay and vacation pay are lumped together in a category they dubbed ""PTO or Paid Time Off"". Also, you aren't given PTO at the beginning of new fiscal year, you have to earn it by working (x) amount of time to earn (x) amount of PTO time. Associates of Walmart are being increasingly DE-prioritized as time passes. The entire company is built around a high turn over rate. One person can be fired or leave the company and they can have another one in his or her spot within a weeks time that knows enough to do the basic work.There is almost know reason to really try and grow with the company. This year alone they did a company wide liquidation of the ""CO-manager"" position. Effectively removing several thousand jobs. Walmart did give them options as to whether or not they wanted to stay with the company in another position or take a severance package though. We lost two of the stores best managers when this happened that together had over 45 years with the company and ran the store better than the actual store manager at that time did. But I guess that's the type of sacrifices big business has to make in order to stay on top. On a positive note i met a lot of nice people and - more...",3,Current Employee,CAP Team 2 Supervisor ,"Magee, MS",7/16/18,2018,7,16
The customers,A typical day is something is always wrong or someone did not come in for work.  What I learned was to do my job at 100% no matter how bad the situation may be. Mind my own business and stay away from the drama and gossip. The work place culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job is having to learn things on your own and no one to train you. The enjoyable part is the customers and making them feel glad they came in the store and helping the customer find whatever they may need.,2,Former Employee,Photo Specialist ,"Killeen, TX",7/16/18,2018,7,16

Managers,It was a great work environment and good job because you work with your team to get things done everyone is a team that kept the store running but managers were a little sloppy at times and came down on the employees when things aren’t done in a timely manner but no workers showed up because they were either not scheduled to work or out sick etc.,4,Former Employee,Loader/Unloader/Stocker ,"Clayton, MO",7/16/18,2018,7,16
Bad place to work.,"At Wal-mart, you are paid way below the average in order to make products cheaper for customers. They constantly change things in the effort of making customers happy, that end up not only aggravating customers but making things twice as hard for employees. Paid time off is based on worked hours and the ratio of worked to earned is very low for non-management employees. their insurance is very high for non-management and they encourage you to seek insurance through government aid program, again, in order to keep prices low for customers. They are extremely uncaring when it comes to illness, offering an insanely low, 8 outs per rolling 6 month period and will often make you work sick even in the fresh areas where working sick is a health hazard. There is zero consistency for hours and you could be working till 10 pm only to open at 6 am, the next day. If you change your availability to suit the shift you want and stop the bouncing shifts, you may not work as often as you like as the scheduling is done largely by computer. The management team is next to useless for employees, as they are slow to act and they rarely communicate with each other. On a few occasions, people were fired for doing their job, but because customers raised a stink.  A quick talk with my fellow coworkers quickly shows how broken moral is as very few people want to work there but they are unable to find work elsewhere.  However, they are not without their good points, they are decent at paying out if you have an injury as long as it isn't due to negligence and after you have been there for several months - more...",1,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Burleson, TX",7/16/18,2018,7,16

Some Policies are not practical,I believe Walmart is a good place to work but some policies are not my idea of good business practice and have at times seem to be not in my best interests as an employee. What I mean is that some policies do not seem to be in the interest of retention of employees.

Going down hill.,"In my job I clean my area, check vendors in using a handheld, check gm merchandise in and then deliver it, unload the grocery trucks, shoot pallets up and down using a walker stacker, research and sort paperwork. The management team is always on a different page which is hard because you tell a vendor no you can't do this and that then they wine to management and they say yes so we look like the bad guys. It's hard when you're not backed by your management team. It's all political. How much can you stroke a manager's ego to get into a higher position. It DOES NOT MATTER how hard you work. Only if you stroke a manager's ego. I can not stress that enough. It use to be a great place to work but those days are gone. They keep eliminating positions. They don't give you a heads up either it's like they just call you in and say screw you. The raise each year is between .20-.30 cents no matter what kind of worker you are. You could be amazing or super sucky and its the same. You still get an evaluation which means nothing since we are all on the same level with same raise. It use to matter if you worked hard you were rewarded, but not anymore. My position is not too bad but apparently it's eventually going away. I can not think of any other position worth doing than DSD. I been with this company for 11 years. People starting here are making close to what I do. Even management seems like they deal with a lot of sucky stuff.",3,Current Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Clarksville, IN",7/15/18,2018,7,15

Benefits or above standard I do believe but the job's itself very stressful long hours upper management not always committed to helping you and your job more committed to ensure that if you make mistakes they find them rather than helping you with mistakes I believe that's due to the turnover that is caused in Walmart because they in their management and specially district managers are more concerned about putting people in place of their picking and not people that are deserving to be in place my experience at Walmart working in several different states and was several different managers and district managers it's not the same in every area certain individuals run things the way they choose and not always the way Walmart wants them to Sam was a great man and he be very disappointed with the way things are run today otherwise it's a good company,3,Former Employee,Store Manager ,various cities throughout the United States,7/14/18,2018,7,14

I took the time to learn how the paint machine operated so that I could assist when they were understaffed in that department, but again the manager of that department became rather territorial about who would be allowed to work with the paint machine.  I was eventually told that I would be allowed to help, but this revealed to me that there was a lot of miscommunication between managers.

They got a big tax break give us a bonus that we had to pay taxes on and then they took away our yearly raise this year. They also took away our holiday pay.

Do special orders, fill the case with fresh & thaw and do backups or whatever is needed to be filled. Workplace is fine. The hardest part of the job is wanting to go elsewhere in the company but being told that ""you are where we NEED you"" regardless of where you WANT to go. The most enjoyable is knowing you just saved someones butt because they forgot or didn't order a cake and they actually appreciate you. Upper management is constantly making new rules company wide that make no sense & tell everyone to follow them. And when those new policies don't work, they make it not work for at least 3 months before they come up with something else that doesn't work.

They say they offer a flexible schedule but that really isn't the case considering if you have anything less that what they want of you, then you are not ""guaranteed hours"". The customers are rarely ever a problem. The problem with this job is the management team with their constant lack of doing nothing but sitting in the office and complaining how things are up to their standards. The management team is the problem. They are inconsiderate and do not offer help when you ask, but are always willing to move you from your area of work to help someone else in their agenda. The so called promoting from within is a joke. The managers show an extreme amount of favoritism and will 9/10 hire from outside the store instead of giving the employee the chance to move or succeed.

Good place to work!,"I had the best job in the building! and best paying job! A typical day at work for me was getting my equipment all ready after I clock in. Equipment includes brand new Crown Quick Pick Remote equipment, brand new hydrogen fuel cell batteries, and Vocollect to do your job. Then there's a safety meeting discussing today's work and other subjects when necessary. You will order fill for the stores until all trips have been assigned. Other duties as assigned. Such as housekeeping. A clean warehouse is a safe warehouse. Especially when the Food Safety Audit guys show up. Depending on the time of year and what shift you're on, the day can be long or short. During a natural disaster expect long days and overtime. Grassroots can be anytime. Don't wait if there's an issue! Tell a member of management. And make sure you follow up with them if they dont get back to you. What I learned very quickly is that the customer owns the warehouse. You're there to satisfy the customer. And do it in a safe, quality, and productive manner all day everyday. Staying on top of your production cannot be stressed enough. Management can be your worst enemy or your best friend. The choice is yours. A good thing to do is to think of new procedures for improving the business of the warehouse. Workplace culture is very good. My best advice though is when you're not on break then you focus on work. No chit chatting, flirting, or gossiping. Save that for break. If you see a safety concern, such as a spill or pallet sticking out in the overhead, report it IMMEDIATELY.

Walmart Review,I would come in open the bakery and attend to any items that needed to be dated and stocked. I would also provide any service needed to any customer that would attend the bakery.

Learning Experience,Wal-Mart enabled me to be a better store manager by giving me the opportunity to seek help from co-manager and store manager. I learned how to manage employees on a daily basis and refer them to a help line whenever needed.

Walmart does get pretty busy during holidays which can be slightly stressful but overtime is available at those times. My job schedule is unpredictable but i feel my position is secure as long as I meet the goals. There are attendance rules which go through a point system for the tardy and absent policy; they are more strict during your first 3 months. If things don’t work out in one position, Walmart is always transferring current associates to different departments but gives multiple chances to employees before termination. It has also taught me the meaning of hard work and earning my pay. It’s great for beginners but can be stressful at times. Sometimes they have little Walmart events and free food in the break room also.",4,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Houston, TX",7/9/18,2018,7,9

"People make the job, right?

nothing,I do not  believe the pay reflects the work done by the workers. Also i took the test for manger and passed it and with 3 available positions open I was told i couldn't three separate times so no growth for employees. once you get in a niche they keep you there. And never got my raise for finishing my pathways.,3,Former Employee,Workers Compensation Coordinator ,"Wellington, FL",7/9/18,2018,7,9
productive place to work,I was working here for 4 years i leaved a lot with customer service skills and the management system. hardest part is not having time home and working alone at times with no help.,4,Current Employee,Customer service representatives ,"Newington, CT",7/9/18,2018,7,9
Completely mismanaged,Management at WalMart is mostly non-existent. Managers take naps in the management office as well as extended 2+ hour lunches. Personnel are placed outside their areas of responsibility with no area coverage and then blamed when they were not allowed to work their department and the job did not get done. Work there if you need to in order to not be homeless.,1,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Cedar Rapids, IA",7/9/18,2018,7,9

Workplace Culture,They are organized and well structured.  When you were hired to open the store you learn how to build all the rack and display to all merchandise. When the store doesn't have accident during the periods they compensate you with meals  that motivates sellers to be more careful and attentive so many at work and in the clientele.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pembroke Pines, FL",7/9/18,2018,7,9

Like I tell them I could work mornings and they would put me in afternoons.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"New Philadelphia, OH",7/9/18,2018,7,9
Good coworkers but corporate's decisions really affects us,"Walmart is a great place to work for those looking for employment. They pay well, you receive paid time off, and coworkers are generally friendly. I like the people I work with, but corporate is constantly changing the rules to the point where our managers can't effectively tell us what to do sometimes. Corporate has been changing schedules for many workers, either cutting hours or by changing certain shifts like from 3 PM - 12 AM to 4 AM to 1 PM. Honestly, I liked working at Walmart because it provides a comfortable income but corporate keeps changing, so it's hard to predict whether I'll have a steady schedule or not.",4,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Tulsa, OK",7/9/18,2018,7,9
Walmart has group meetings and all employees have a free lunch on Walmart when gathered to talk Abt teams.,Walart is a great store that keeps coustomers and employees with a smile on their face I would recommend anyone to work there with their workers compensation I don't expect nobody to go wrong with Walmarts plans.

A great job for beginner's...,All in all Walmart wasn't a bad work place. Within a year I learned and knew almost everything in every department! Management was up and down all depending on which one's working at the time. the cultural aspect of it was excellent very diverse and a lot of team work which made the days go by smoothly! I would say the hardest part of the job was the random last minute request from management to stay longer and to decline would sometimes lead to a verbal warning or write up!,3,Former Employee,Stocker/Maintenance ,"Las Vegas, NV",7/9/18,2018,7,9

Did not enjoy working here,"I worked at Walmart as a CAP Team 2 associate for only nine months and I came to realize,  just soon after the first couple of days, that management was very poor.

fast pased work,I worked in the frozen/dairy department with one other person as help its very stressful and a lot of responsibility. There is also a lot of heavy lifting involved from lifting pallets to lifting boxes filled with juice or milk over your head to place in a bin. Its very fast passed to which you have to skip a break or get your lunch time cut in half just to finish all the responsibilities that are asked of you and at times still cutting it short in time since they would be on your case for getting any minute of overtime.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"La Mirada, CA",7/8/18,2018,7,8

"Co workers somewhat nice, Management horrible",Walmart is a machine that chews people up and spits them out. The turnover rate is high so that most employees are minimum wage.

Decent but impossible to work with.,"With the recent changes, everything is more chaotic than it already was. Nobody wants to give us a straight answer on anything we ask and require us to change our availability if we wish to get more hours.

I'm ready for a change from a company that doesn't seem to care about its employees to tell them the truth about things.",4,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Jonesboro, AR",7/8/18,2018,7,8
management was a joke,"my manager treated me very poorly and interrogated me in the security room after lying to other management. I was having health problems at the time and he said that I could switch to another position privately, then, in front of a camera, told me that he never said such a thing.

Overall, the job was a-okay. I worked in the garden center mostly, so I watered plants most days there, and on rainy days or during winter when we only had indoor plants, I would help out in other departments like Housewares or Automotive. I had a hard time switching positions though and was told to apply for certain management positions, which I had already planned on doing. I applied for them, but most of them were given to those that worked outside of the company, which was quite disappointing to me as they say that they prefer to hire from within.

Several times the change was very difficult because of the impact it may have had on my associates, but we had to support the change in order to try and help them adapt.  The other would be accountability regardless of personal friendships etc. in the management teams. The associates that I worked with throughout the years were the most enjoyable part of the job.

Not a very good place to work,"A typical day at work would be slow to quick paced, the pay is not worth it because customers are allowed to harass, threaten or treat employees with disrespect just to earn business. It is more of no matter what it is always the employees fault even if the employee goes out of their way or job description for the customer and they are not satisfied. Management does nothing if a customer harasses, mistreats or threatens employees. The pay does sound good but when hired hours will be cut and the expected pay is not made for that position. Unable to talk to management such as transferring if unsatisfied with current position and when it is done they say it will take a very long time and may not go through. No interest for the employee at all if anything after being hired they are ignored when they talk to management about issues such as customers harassing, threatening or mistreating employees. Training almost doesn't exist it is done on the computer which does very little and management such as supervisors are even less trained some do not know how to fix or address issues with the department so it makes it a hostile work environment.  Over all rating it is not worth working for this Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Unknown ,"Ruidoso Downs, NM",7/7/18,2018,7,7
Fun place to work,Management is good to associates and they have an open door policy. They take care of the associates. There is PTO which you get by working (ex. Work 20 hours and get 1 hour of PTO). There are quarterly bonuses and associates get a discount card. You also get to choose what times of the day you want to work (ex. Between 7 AM and 11 PM).,5,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service/Money Center ,"Claremore, OK",7/7/18,2018,7,7

Most corners are cut,"It's a decent start-up job but, beyond receiving some beginner training, the bright side ends there. Experiences vary (slightly) by location and management, but I can't ethically recommend working there to anyone. _x000D_Favoritism is a huge factor in just about everything: advancement, scheduling, workload, and position. Ageism is also a large presence in this location, and not in the way one would think. The younger employees are expected to do the job of, at least, three people in order to pick up the slack.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Windham, ME",7/6/18,2018,7,6
Wal-mart,As a salaried manager this job is demanding and consumes a lot of energy to do your job. dealing with customers and associates is the most demanding part.

Get a good store manager,The store that I worked at was very rough. We had a good store but you could never please the store manager.

WalMart. A nice temp job but not great for long term.,"I like WalMart but there is a limit to what I can handle. I use to be a cashier till I moved to Frozen, that would be great except that the manager of the cashiers was telling the othera not to take me because I was a terrible worker. Because of that, it took almpst a year before they let me move. So if your good at tour job then they are going to fight tooth and nail to keep you there. I have been talking to them about manager positions or even assistant manager and they say that they will get back to me. Two years and nothing. I work  7 hours a day, I use to work 8 hours and sometimes I would work over to get more hours just to live off of until they caught me and cut my hours back. Im barely making ends meet. The people are friendly and all but this place gets so boring aometimes that people start rumors and its like High School all over again. Its a good temp job but it just isnt the place for me. I also work the cashier, stock frozen food and bread. I have asked for a raise but they wont allow it.",4,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Lewisburg, TN",7/6/18,2018,7,6
Good place to start and move up or as a stepping stone through college,"I would definitely recommend Walmart for someone looking to move up and make a career of it or who is in school.

A good workplace for many people,"A typical workday will have you assigned to more work than one person can do.  Training is mostly non-existent; you are required to complete online courses, however you are not given the information you need to do your job effectively.  Management is frequently uninvolved or micromanagers.  The workplace culture is juvenile and gossipy.  People are more likely to base decision on how well they like the employee over work ethic and capabilities.  I learned that you have to push management to show you how anything is done and every manager does things differently.  The hardest part of they job is being expected to provide excellent customer service to everyone at one time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing a kind word or a smile can make someone's day.",5,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Leavenworth, KS",7/6/18,2018,7,6

"Contradictory management, putting out fires","I've dealt with about thirty salaried managers in the last four years, and there was one consistent thread that ran through them all: inconsistency. From the top down, they can't seem to stick to their own orders, contradicting themselves and each other on almost an hour by hour basis. Regardless of what you do, you'll be threatened with coachings, whether you follow the direction of a supervisor, or the head office's ""One Best Way.""

Management is unfit,I feel like the only way to advance at walmart is if you become friends with other management.

Walmart is a good place to work but has its flaws as well,A typical day at work is setting task for Associates fill endcaps and Side corners for the remainder of the day. I also have to cover for csm's in front end for there Lunch breaks. I've learned a lot from Walmart from the Customer Service to Customer Courtesy. How to be fair and treat people how I want to be treated. The Hardest Part of the job is the stress of dealing with uncooperative management with peer pressure to push associates instead of motivate them to achieve even higher goals and enjoy there Job.

I've have learned and gained more social skills here than I have anywhere I've worked and for that I am thankful.,3,Current Employee,Grocery Support Manager ,"Farmerville, LA",7/5/18,2018,7,5

Review from a Contractor (NOT an employee),"To be fair, I will clearly state that I was a contractor and not an employee on Walmart's payroll. I worked in the department adjacent to Sales, so I heard telephone conversations from our cubicle that caused me to have an unfavorable opinion about how they do business. The culture at Wal-Mart is extremely competitive. They demand exclusivity from those who would like to do business with them, insisting that they NOT sell to their competition. If that was not agreed upon, then Walmart would not agree to sell their product.",3,Former Employee,Technical Writer ,"Bentonville, AR",7/5/18,2018,7,5

Very cut throat company,The customer service that some of the employees provide is rather sad. Management does nothing to help boost morale in the store. If employees complain then their hours get cut.,5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Dover, DE",7/5/18,2018,7,5
Typical retail enviroment,"My availability is open. they encourage it for anyone who wants hours consistently. This means i work a variety of hours and never have the same schedule or days off. if you open to handle putting the money out and making sure the store is ready for the day. If you close you put all the money away and and ensure that all the customer are out of the building. both have their ups and downs but no matter what shift i work my job always includes, giving cashiers breaks and lunches, having enough registers open we don't have lines, giving out change and taking money from overflowing registers, auditing registers, handling customer complaints, troubleshooting technology problems and associate scheduling errors, and making sure the day goes smoothly. It is always busy for my position, as we handle the majority of issues in the store and are expected to keep up with the work flow regardless of staffing and upper management availability. occasionally i have to fill in for the upper management with phone calls and and associate issues. As a matter of fact they are encouraged to come to CSM's (me) before all other managers.   Due to all this, in my five years i have learned quite a few multi-tasking techniques and gained problem solving abilities, plus an abundance of irreplaceable people skills. As exhausting as this job can be, at the end of the day, your attitude is what can make this job good or not.

Great company to me for 20 years;  Insecurity with the future,Great company but a lot of layoffs the past few years and now mandatory performance evaluation curves in IT.  Feels like goal is to prevent future layoffs and associated costs.

All about the company,"This company is the largest private employer in the US, which is both good and bad. It is good because there is advancement opportunity and opportunities for job continuity if relocating; it is bad because the company often treats employees as cogs in a machine rather than people with lives outside of work. Furthermore, in recent months, the home office has been increasing efforts to micromanage stores, rather than letting management in stores adjust practices and policies in keeping with local and regional differences. While a modicum of standardization is desirable within a company, recognition of regional differences is a key to growing sales; what works in one area may not work so well in another. I believe that this micromanagement will likely be harmful to the company as a whole.",3,Current Employee,Produce Sales Associate/Produce Department Manager ,"Biloxi, MS",7/5/18,2018,7,5

Most days we stocked merchandise and help customers with any questions and checkout process.

Lack of communication with supervisors and cranky coworkers,Many employees who I worked with either hated working at Walmart or hated working with people. They weren't shy to share their opinions with their coworkers and it felt like you were pulling teeth just to get some help from them. If you were able to find your supervisor then you might be able to talk to them about any issues you might have. Your coworkers will be acting unprofessional in front of customers and your supervisors will discipline you in front of both customers and coworkers alike.

very competitive place.,"At Walmart, a typical day of work is very challenging.  You learn new skills but, management was not really friendly back then.

Coworkers.,"As a personal shopper in Walmart, I am timed. I have been told by my manager, his manager, and their manager all directly that I am not to engage with customers. The policy at Walmart is to follow the “Ten Foot Rule” that every employee must use. If a customer is within ten feet of you, then you must greet, help, and thank that customer. But as personal shoppers being timed, we were told not to. Which creates a great deal of stressful situations with customers that don’t understand that as much as I wish I could help them, and I really do (I absolutely hate not being able to help a customer), I can’t. And then, there are coworkers from other departments that want to have idle chit chat and get offended when I ask them to help a customer or give them distracted answers to whatever nonsense they say as I’m trying to find the items as quickly as possible. I’m a hard worker and I love to work, but the way I’m treated by my coworkers has me looking for other options. The pay is good. If that’s what’s most important to you, I do recommend this job.

I was a cashier which was fun at times because me and my friends would have scan battles to see who could get their customers out of the line the quickest. Our managers loved it and so did the customers because we didnt waste time or spare the service, however all jobs have there slow days and Walmart believe it or not has plenty. Walmart has a very strict attendance policy and schedules are made at least 4 weeks ahead, so getting off work was a challenge because so many people work there so plan months ahead if you need time off. Walmart very often bought employees lunches, and before starting work you must complete several hours on the computer which are paid. Walmart is great because after so many months I believe 4 or 5 months you can transfer which is great because Walmart is EVERYWHERE. It's a very convenient job. Walmart also goes several months without overtime which the managers will also help Implement.

Disappointing,"Wal-Mart has the potential to be great, but they unfortunately fall short of their promises._x000D__x000D_Being hired on, the salary looks great and they talk about promotion and drive - they have comprehensive training programs that look to enlighten and inspire, but once you hit the store, the smoke and mirrors come to reality._x000D__x000D_The store managers create their culture and there are some good ones, but goals are sometimes unrealistic and benefit the store manager (who can play the game to assure bonus) over the other management.  ASM's are driven hard and responsible for most of the work, but see the least return._x000D__x000D_Good reviews, a team that works hard and drives numbers, combined with growth are not enough to get promoted.

Retail can be challenging in many ways,"I have worked 3 diffrent stores in the past 13 years. Each store had its issues with managers. Each had their own style of doing things. Some strict and others want things done quickly and neatly. I believe communication between employees and management needs improvement in areas of respect, and understanding each persons strength. To set a goal for improvement on their struggles. To stay positive, and team support for each other is important. We are missing a key part of being there for the new associate, each employee should step up and help them succeed. I do my best, stay positive. ..yes I will joke, but I take my job seriously.

There were a lot of people quitting for the lack there of the work loads that was forced upon them that it was too much for them to handle so our team was constantly small. I would recommend someone to get a job at walmart if they're starting out but its a very stressful, high staked, high reward type of job and hopefully you can deal with the customers who come in doing the most criminal and questionable things.I would say the most i enjoyed at my work despite everything were my co workers and the customers who came in who smiled and asked for help instead of wasting my time by asking me where something is when its right by them or customer willingly opening products to only give to me moments later after its eaten or half used.",4,Former Employee,Cap team 2 ,"East Brunswick, NJ",7/2/18,2018,7,2

Poor Management,"Very Poor Management, they treat associates horrible. Its like being in high school all over again.

"Although Walmart is a good company, they have poor management and out of date policies","You could look all over the store and never see a manager. Not to mention that they do the bare minimum to help their associates and it seems that the managers are in their on clique and feel they are above everyone else. There policies are out of date and crazy as well. For example, there attendance policy is unfair because if your absent for 4 days within your first 6 months working there, you will be terminated. Also, it seems like the managers are robotic and not human, where they don't care about their fellow worker and only care about their pay.",3,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Sebastian, FL",7/2/18,2018,7,2

Also they never wanted to move anyone to a different position ..However on a good day at walmart it was ok..",3,Former Employee,Stocker/Receiver ,"Mexia, TX",7/2/18,2018,7,2
Ability to Advance quickly,"At Walmart, you have the opportunity to advance quickly within the company and your store. However, the management needs re-training. They need to understand the difference between achievable expectations and unachievable expectations. The management has their favorites that can get away with anything, then they have their people who they like to pick on. If your on the receiving  end of their hostility, be ready to be set up to fail. Overall the company is customer-oriented and it depends all on the store that you work in as to what your experience will be like. I love my job, if management would leave you alone and let you do your job, it would be fantastic and I would be able to get so much more done than all of the things I do already.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,United States,7/2/18,2018,7,2

You do get a 10% discount on most stuff.  There are no sick/vacation days, just points. You can collect PTO hours.

sloppy transition,the company is advancing quick and doing a poor job of ensuring new managers are fully trained for their roles.  new managers are given 2 weeks for training then put in stores not knowing how to execute putting a burden on other managers to pick up their slack.

I compare Wal-Mart to high school,"Working for Wal-Mart, I had thought i was back in high school. There is so much drama, and gossip it is basically a playground for grown children.

The most enjoyable part of the job, is assisting the customers, and being left alone to complete my tasks.

The equipment that we use to slot and tag doesnt work half the time, And it doesnt matter if you try to transfer to another department, they will throw you wherever they need you. They do not seem to take in the consideration of their employees thoughts and only want results, and when things don't get done under a certain amount of time, an their butt's are being chewed out by higher management, we get coached.

The way they talked, it seemed like I had a lot of opportunities to move up in the company, but I couldn't do the night shift hours anymore with how little I felt I was getting paid.

Productive workplace,"On a typical day at work I would clock in and go straight to the back room to start unloading the semi truck. Then once that was done if it was time I would take my first break. After that I would start stocking freight on the sales floor until it was time for lunch. Come back do the same until my second and last break. Then stock until it was time to clock out and leave. It was very repetitive day in and day out. Management was pretty relaxed as long as you were doing your job and not goofing off. The best part was getting to help customers and seeing them smile when you helped them find an item. The hardest part would have to be when the management was mad about something or if they got yelled at by their boss. Then they would make you do a bunch of unnecessary things around the store. I am all for helping a fellow worker, but when they are rude just because they messed up and got yelled at for it that is where I draw the line.

Stressful and very fast paced,One of my least favorite jobs. I was working while still trying to graduate high school. Which at the time was more important than making money.

It's okay starting out as your first job.,"If you're fresh out of high school and need a summer job then working at Wal-Mart is a good place to start. But if you're trying to make a career out of it, then good luck. In my store it's very hard to get out of a position that you started in, trying to move up to a manger in my store is not worth it because you are basically  signing your life over to the store manager who will over worker you 60+ hours and you don't receive no overtime because manager's are salaried so your basically working your life away for nothing. I've been behind the scenes in alot of Wal-Mart's and trust me when I say this EVERY WALMART IS NOT THE SAME, meaning working in my store is lifeless and boring but go work in another Wal-Mart and it might be fun and very exciting .. so the job experience differs depending on what Wal-Mart you're working for.",3,Current Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Kilmarnock, VA",6/29/18,2018,6,29

Great for those who can focus on a very narrow field of life.,"It seemed to me that the regular employees and first level supervision were almost invisible to the upper level.

I was able to move in between 4 store and move up in the company with the only training coming from Wal-Mart its self.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Hagerstown, MD",6/29/18,2018,6,29
Productive and fun workplace with a nice break room.,"When i first started working at Walmart I met a lot of nice people (especially the managers). I've learned a different way of stocking, which was more understanding. The best part about that job was the customers, even though there were some who weren't polite the customers were the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part of that job is when you have you to straighten up the canned food and make it look presentable for the customers.",5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Hartsville, SC",6/29/18,2018,6,29
Its okay.,"My normal day usually involves picking up returns every half an hour, placing the items on the shelves, and straightening my section so everything looks neat. However, I can end up being tossed to three or four other departments and then be questioned on why my department looks a mess. I am often expected to pick up after 1st and 3rd shift while my shift never gets additional help. This job is good if you don't care for a team environment. But nothing else. Management will happily gnaw at you for everything you do incorrectly, but will never (or rarely ever) give you praise for doing well.",3,Current Employee,Toy Sales Associate ,"Orlando, FL",6/29/18,2018,6,29
Good workplace environment,Good place to work for.  Great benefits and pay.  Friendly environment.  Training and pathways to help you perform your job well.  You get 2 breaks and an hour lunch.,5,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,PA,6/29/18,2018,6,29
"Productive, with margin for errors.","Walmart is open to input from employees on matters about work, so the company tends to keep ahead of any weaknesses or problems, or at least catch up that, as management deems they are sufficiently aware and able to ask more associates. However the changes in managers from one shift to another, and in products, and how to handle their movement to the shelves, without associate confusion or disagreement, can become an ongoing issue.",4,Former Employee,Stocker / Greeter ,"Clovis, NM",6/29/18,2018,6,29

Very productive work and very friendly neighborhood,This job is a very busy place. There is always something that needs to be done so you will never be bored or have nothing to do. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are not happy with some type of service that was provided to them. But considering I am excellent with people my customer service provides the best when it comes to people like that.,4,Former Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Greensboro, NC",6/29/18,2018,6,29
the most enjoyable part about workign at walmart,I've enjoyed working for Wal-Mart for the short period  of time. the only thing I missed was the friendly people. Wal-Mart  could've been a better experience for me if I didn't have trouble  with some of the staff about me  finding someone to cover my shift due to having had a child that was born with multiple disability which I don't have anymore because she's deceased. Now my work ethic has improved,1,Former Employee,Sams Club ,"Chesterfield, MOchester",6/29/18,2018,6,29

Horrible,Working at Walmart became a stressful way of life. Never feeling like you were good enuff to work or do your job right. The customers were decent for the most part but there was never a peaceful moment.,1,Former Employee,Meat Department Associate Supervisor ,"Ellenwood, GA",6/29/18,2018,6,29
The co workers o worked with were amazing people. I didn't mind the and the job was simple enough as well. But management was a problem.,"During my time there, co workers were really were a blast to have around. We all helped each other out when we could and had each other back. But with all jobs there is a down side, and you would think it would be there couple of customers that come in grumpy, but it was management. They were disrespectful, and only cared about themselves. They would down talk to everyone as if they physically owned them instead of was their boss and higher up. They didn't respect customers nor other employees. That's not a safe work environment.",3,Former Employee,Cap team 2 ,"Lexington Park, MD",6/29/18,2018,6,29
Great company to work for,"Couldn't say enough good things about the company. Accumulate a good amount of pto. Stock options. Health insurance and other insurances. 401k plan. Flexible hours if you have specific requirements. Great job security. Always room for advancement if you apply yourself and show good quality characteristics. Also there's so many departments, if you get tired of one talk to management about switching out, they often times will allow you to switch to a different department, but this is not a guarantee. The only complaints you can have is the starting pay ($11) and the %10 discount you receive doesn't work on everything in the store.",5,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"McHenry, IL",6/29/18,2018,6,29
not a good place to work,"open door policy is a joke and upper management not very friendly,open, or understanding.  The pay is low and not much room for advancement.

Friendly Environment At WalMart,"Wal Mart was a very fun job. From the customers that remember your face to the staff, everybody cared about you. I learned to always be aware of my surroundings being a cashier at WalMart customers always liked to be sneaky with alcohol.

Fast pace and intense management,"Working for Walmart has its ups and downs. The first 3 years it was a fun family friendly environment. With the changes in management over time it became more intense and over whelming, most manager have little to no respect for their employees",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Dallas, TX",6/29/18,2018,6,29
Not the worst job.,"As I'm looking at my last two weeks at Wal~Mart, I see that it hasn't been as bad as my only other job at McDonald's. The pace varied from ""holy moly, so much to do"" on busy days like holidays, to trying to find something we had not yet cleaned on the least busy days. Some co-workers in other departments rubbed me the wrong way, but I was overall happy with my department (produce), and never had a serious problem with either of my two managers, the worst thing being that at times a Time-Off request was denied because of no coverage._x000D_ A problem with career advancement is that while it exists at different levels, depending on what area you look to move up in like department manager or all the way to Assistant manager, you are probably going to have to relocate to another store to find an opening for that job, unless you get lucky with timing or they specifically pick you to replace a retiring/fired associate.",3,Current Employee,Produce Sales Associate ,"Ottawa, OH",6/29/18,2018,6,29

Pay okay management terrible,Pay is decent for the work that you do but the supervisors and management are terrible. They will continue to raise their expectations over time and act like it has always been the same and make you look like you are slacking off. They say they want something done quickly but then show you a long drawn out way of doing something that takes twice as long as before. It takes months to transfer to a new department even after you have been replaced 4 times. If management doesn't like you they cut your hours out of spite. It's a great temporary job but don't stay over a year,1,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Newburgh, IN",6/29/18,2018,6,29

On the other hand... They don't work well around your child care schedule nor do they care. I was told I would be moving departments. I was then fired shortly after. I was told one thing by an assistant and another by the store manager.The asm's and store manager do not communicate well.

Asset Protection Associate,"Working as AP for Walmart defiantly has it's perks as well as it's cons.
