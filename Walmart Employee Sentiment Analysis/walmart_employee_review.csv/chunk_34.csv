Meet and worked with a lot of wonderful people,My co-workers were very pleasant to work with and very helpful to one another. We worked very well together as a team and communicated quite well with one another. The hardest part of the job was always being short staffed to a brand new store that just opened. But with hard work and a game plan for working 2 departments with 3 people we always found a solution.,4,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Palm Harbor, FL",1/26/16,2016,1,26

Managers and employees come and go,"Good place to work out of high school but for a long term career, not so much. Every few months we get a new manager overnight. I was thinking about moving up with a company but the managers are telling me its a bad idea. I cant say to much about my co- workers because so many have come and gone.

Very stressful place to work. nobody smiles or cares that they are at work and i believe management is the reason.,"Come in at 7 and open the deli which actually opened for business at 7. Turn on all fryers, rotisserie, put together slicers, fill all empty holes on floor and in deli, as well as wait on customers. Wash racks from soaker from the night shift and start rotisserie.

Telezon used for ordering, counts, throw aways, pricing and throw away dates. Pull Pizzas and salads from freezer, date and stock shelves while keeping an eye on the deli for customers. Enter information in computer about food temps, freezer and floor case temps.  Wash dishes, start cooking food at 8;00 to be done by 9: 00 for sales to begin. Temp food once it was cooked, while in hot case and keep on track of when products in hot case needed to be pulled,weighed and throw away and sticker made for item by weight.Cook new products,if time is allowed before the ones in hot case expire. If there is another employee coming in then take a 15 minute break,if not then you must wait to someone can cover for you so you can take your break. when new employees were hired ,we were expected to train them. On closing shifts all equipment had to be cleaned,all floors mopped and disinfected.

Productive and Energetic Day,A typical day at Walmart is normal. We would put away the items that needed to be put away. We would sometimes overwhelm ourselves. I learned that not everyone is people friendly. You can't base your attitude based upon how another customer acted. The most enjoyable part of my job would being able to help someone and not have them feel like they have to stress. I also loved the connection I had with the customers.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Dundalk, MD",1/25/16,2016,1,25

Fast pace place to work if you like to stay busy,"My day starts off pretty early but I still keep a smile on my face when greeting the customers that enter and exit the store. I learned how to multi task in a busy environment. The management team is awesome and so are my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with an irate customer. But the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help, satisfy and please the customers that come in and out of the store.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Lancaster, TX",1/25/16,2016,1,25

Good Company Good Management,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. The only complaint I have is that the hourly wage is low and that the game of favorites is played when looking for advancement. Unfortunately if you do a really good job at something it is extremely difficult to change positions or advance to an available position. In fact although I was considered to be without doubt the top employee in my position I was never able to move to any other position. I do understand that a company has to wait until they can fill a position before approving a transfer but the company did not put the effort into it that I feel I deserved. Employes are given an additional 0.50 USD per year.,4,Former Employee,Unloader and Inventory Management ,"Haines City, FL",1/25/16,2016,1,25

The experience gained is invaluable.",4,Former Employee,Senior Systems Engineering Team Lead ,"Bentonville, AR",1/25/16,2016,1,25
I don't recommend it,About the only good thing from Walmart is the flexible schedule and the other employees who are stuck there with you. Other then that get ready for the worst types of customers and an overly complicated management system.,2,Former Employee,Electronics Department Manager ,"Huntley, IL",1/25/16,2016,1,25

Inconsistant work environment,Learned a variety of work related experiences throughout the store. Management varies from one store to another. A high amount of inconsistency between varying members of management. Hardest part of job was completing everything that each different manager asked of you and sometimes given conflicting directions from several different people. Many associates are favored over others and not necessarily because of the favored associates work ethics or ability. Promotions do not always occur by most qualified. I loved helping my customers have an awesome shopping experience and would go above and beyond to try and correct a bad situation so the customer would leave on a good note.,3,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Herkimer, NY",1/25/16,2016,1,25

"Fun, family type feeling at work.

My favorite part of the job is making my customers happy.",4,Current Employee,Cook ,"Waxahachie, TX",1/24/16,2016,1,24
Walmart is a very large corporation that provides jobs and opportunities to a diverse number of people,"Walmart allows customers to come into their stores and find all of their needs in one location.  They can have an enjoyable experience shopping there and know that they will be able to find what they need.  Walmart tries to create a family atmosphere for its associates. I've learned, due to a recent family crisis, that our family at Walmart helps its associates during the most difficult time.  When an associate is at a loss of what to do during such a devastating time, the human resource department steps in to help guide the associate.  There is a lot of advancement for Walmart's managers if they're willing to relocate and put forth the effort.  I would assume that the hardest part working for Walmart is to keep that family atmosphere.  It's such a large company and when a company gets so large it becomes impersonal.  I love to see the effect that Walmart has on a community that has been devastated by a natural disaster.  Walmart steps in to help supply water and other supplies without expecting anything in return.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Fayetteville, AR",1/24/16,2016,1,24

The manager was not a good manager because he use to show favoritism to other associates and i felt that he was not running his store properly. The coworkers were awesome they were very lovable to work with and i enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of my job was to keep everything organized and keep everything folded but i managed to get the job done and complete. The most enjoyable part of my job was to keep the customers happy and satisfied.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Milwaukee, WI",1/21/16,2016,1,21
Stiff and Rigid Work Place.,"Working at Walmart at starts out great, with promises that are quickly shown to be false. the training was extremely poor and borderline non-existent. They had computerized training, which does very little for actual experience. My first day on the job, they ""threw me to the wolves."" As I was alone for most of the shift. Honestly, the best part about the job was the extremely positive coworkers, they made the days bearable, and much easier to get through. A typical day is very hard to pin-point, as the tasks changed drastically day by day.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Olathe, KS",1/21/16,2016,1,21

Room for Improvement,"While I have had overall a good experience with Walmart as an associate and as a company, I believe that there is definite improvement needed in associate relations. There is not as much personal care as there was when I started the company. As a long-time loyal associate I feel like I am not getting the hours I deserve and when I go to talk to management, I get told to go talk to someone else.

"Clean, Fast, and Hard","You get pulled around the store to where ever they need you to be even though you are assigned to an area in your paperwork. You get two 15 minute breaks and a lunch if there is time. Usually you get one of the 15 minutes breaks and a late lunch. I learned how to act kind towards people who are being very rude to me and my fellow associates. Management for the most part was pretty nice we had a few at both the WalMarts I worked for that made it hard to want to stay there. But, overall they were nice. Most of the Associates were good hard working people but you had some that did not do what they were suppose to. I think that is true with any job though. The hardest part of that job was the customers because most of them were very rude for no reason and you had to be fast as well as friendly with them not matter how they acted.

Walmart wasn't the best to work for.,"A typical work day at Walmart for a Cart Pusher is them constantly yelling at you to bring in more carts than possible even with multiple workers helping cause of the shear amount of customers on a day per day biases. You had to bring in only 20 carts at a time while an average of 25-30 carts went back out into the lot, while you also needed to assist customers with their items if they was unable to take them to their car themselves which was because they was normally elderly or handicapped. If the main maintenance workers needed assistance then you needed to give them a helping hand by stopping what you needed to do an help them out. The hardest part of the job was the rule set of only able to be allowed to bring in 20 carts at a time while helping everyone else with their job, and customers taking out between 25-30 cart into the lot as it was always a constant struggle to keep up.The most enjoyable part of the job was honestly the customers.They was always more than happy when you went out of your way an above the needed requirements to help them on their way an it normally gave them a smile and/or a happy step to their walk. The co-workers there was more than nice an knew the struggle of what was needing to be done as everyone was always busy an in a bit of a rush to have ends meet, but yet they was always willing to try an help if they could find a few minutes if not only seconds to help you knowing you'd do the same for them.",3,Former Employee,Cart Pusher/ Maintenance assistant. ,"Clearfield, PA",1/21/16,2016,1,21

I stood in one spot for up to an 8 hour shift scanning items through a cash register and took the form of payment (debit cards, food stamp card when the store became a supercenter, credit cards or cash or check).

"The business sucks, the people are great!","All the stories you hear about Walmart's benefits, pay, and hiring are all true.  The pay was below what I could afford, the ability to get a raise and move up within the company is dismal, the ability to move laterally in the company is difficult, and there are no benefits unless you're a salaried member of management (which you won't be because they are constantly moving the ones they have around so they don't have to hire more).  There is a LARGE turn-around in employees because they expect you to do the job of 3 people, and they want it done in 4 hours.  Oh, and don't expect much help from the assistant managers.  Two or three are good and will actually get down and help you out; the rest just walk around and yell at you for not doing your job well/fast/hard enough._x000D__x000D_HOWEVER!

I averaged about 2 awards a month, between the secret shopper awards, the speed awards, and the number of credit cards and/or product care plans sold.  I had health concerns when I worked there, and HR helped me find the resources I needed to get my medications and doctor's visits.

So when your job isn't finish and all you get in trouble and written up.

No Room for Growth,"I worked 9 years as a Pharmacy Technician. While I did love Pharmacy and my co-workers, Wal-Mart mostly taught me everything a pharmacy shouldn't be. It's money first, customers and employees last. You are just a number to them. You can easily be replaced by someone who they can brainwash and pay less. I worked as a Pharmacy Technician because I truly enjoy helping others but Wal-Mart doesn't care about that. They focus on things that have nothing to do with patient care. Pharmacists can't stick up for their Technicians. Poor management skills. No one is on the same page. There is also no room for growth at Wal-Mart Pharmacy, your either a Pharmacist or a Technician and that's all you'll ever be. There is nothing to work towards, no promotions, no additional training, no extra pay. They work you to the bone paying you the least amount possible before they throw you out on the curb when you actually speak up for what is right and speak the truth. Wal-Mart is nothing but lies. You speak the truth and they hand you your final statement of pay.

"Excellent for students, not the best decision for anyone else.","As a student, Wal-Mart's willingness to work with my schedule was extremely beneficial. Attending class during the week and working on the weekends helped me obtain my Bachelor's Degree quite comfortably._x000D__x000D_The problem is that seeking employment at Wal-Mart to pay the bills rather than just the expenses of a typical college student is a very dark task indeed. Wal-Mart tends to have managers that attempt to coerce employees into staying late to finish tasks of the next shift. The method to this is simply ordering the staff of the previous shift to stay about an hour late in order to perform a task such as stocking. When the individual employees say ""no"" to staying past their scheduled hours, management will threaten ""coaching"", with three coachings resulting in a termination of employment. Employees with two prior coachings are most at risk for this type of abuse. _x000D_There are no upsides to agreeing to working late, as Walmart management often refuses overtime in favor of ""cut hours."" Cut hours are simply hours that are cut off of your schedule in order to make an even 32-40 hour workweek on an associate's paycheck. _x000D__x000D_Walmart is perfect for students due to their willingness to work around school, but anyone seeking a career should definitely avoid this employer.",3,Former Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Bay City, TX",1/18/16,2016,1,18

Any item not shelved on the floor becomes placed in the cooler area for holding.  One of the main things at Wal-Mart is to remember CFF (clean, fast, and friendly).  Even day I choose one or multiple areas to deep clean and cull.  When we call products we decide whether to pitch them out or put them with the biweekly food pick up for the Foodbank.  Everything we take out of stock must be recorded.  The best part of the department is the manager and co-workers.  However, hands down the reason I still remain there is the customers.

Easy but Frustrating,"Walmart's Management skill need work. Always understaffed, and constantly being moved to areas that aren't our own but its still easy. You never get your own area done though this way. The customers can make it the worth while but there is the ones who think were just out to get their money which is not a good experience. The hardest part is the most frustrating and all it is that management wants one person to do 3 to 4 departments including their own completely zoned, completely stocked, and completely clean. Which is not possible when as soon as you fix one thing someone messes it up, But that is all in a perfect world.",4,Current Employee,Hardware Associate ,"Wadsworth, OH",1/16/16,2016,1,16

A steady job,A typical work day involves assisting customers and fellow co-workers while completing tasks. Some aspects are very repetitive while at others times something new comes along.

My manager told me that I should just quit and find another job altogether.  He even sent me job listings._x000D__x000D_This did not make me feel like a valued employee. Going to higher management resulted in me being handed a pamphlet for some over the phone counseling service who would talk to me about financial planning and coping with stress.

A good employer for high school kids and the elderly.,"I begin my shift by answering phones and directing customers to the appropriate person or Department.  The company's communication goes directly though me.  I also must make all overhead pages during my shift.  I am also responsible to put away returned items and provide store security that I must report to a manager.  The hardest part of my job is that since I am a fast worker, I find that people from the shift before me leave a lot of work for me because they know I will get it all done.  I enjoy the fact that I am entrusted to be the only employee on my shift.  I am able to work with a manager on duty or not.",2,Current Employee,customer service specialist ,"Englewood, FL",1/14/16,2016,1,14

Busy and fast paced,A very busy and fast paced work schedule. Only time we would really talk is with customers while doing carry-outs. Other than lunch breaks  with other employees. I learned that it is hard but not impossible to work in a stressful environment and the management does not full around with lazy and non-compliant employees on the work schedule. I worked pretty hard but the other employees were impressive in their duties. Working at incredible efficiency and keeping up.

typical workplace retail scene,go in go to work find out where and what you are to be doing sometimes it isnt what your job title says i guess mostly what i learned is how to do 20 different jobs at the same time and somehow manage to get them all done on my task time(youare only given certain time frame to complete tasks and it has to be logged into computr) the coworkers are can go either way some are a team player others are for themself a lot of hard working people though i think the hardest part of the job is being coached because you cant complete a task in a certain amount of time when it says on the intructions takes 2 people to complete but youre by yourself the most enjoyable part was when it was time for vacation,2,Former Employee,Floor Associate ,"Huntington, WV",1/13/16,2016,1,13

alright for the money,"Management is divided: half are very nice/get almost everything done, the other half is extremely rude/doesn't do anything except walk around on their phones and yelling at people telling them what to do all day. I was almost never in the department I was hired to be in because we were short-staffed nearly 95% of the time, and we were short-staffed so often because management wouldn't hire the necessary staff.

There could be multiple cashiers on the same register ( not at the same time of course) but I didnt care for that. No two weeks were the same with hours on and off so the work schedule is all over the place. For myself, I like to have a set schedule.

Really just depends on the store you get.,"Working at Walmart can be great or terrible - it depends on how the management decides to run the store. Some store management can really care and do what they can to help to make the store one you can be proud to work at, and some store management can just not give a dang and actively work against helping the store and let the clientele destroy it. Depending on your position, you can choose your hours, but sometimes that doesn't work out in your favor, since it's first-come, first-served for people with the same job code. The quarterly bonus can be $500 at some stores, whereas some stores won't get one because of the store's terrible performance. Give it a try, since their minimum wage switches to $10/hour soon. Usually the smaller stores do better in terms of employee morale.",3,Former Employee,Front End Associate ,"Wichita, KS",1/12/16,2016,1,12

Overnight's not bad.,"Working for this company at that particular store wasn't a bad experience. A typical night of work was the same as it was every night. Stock, and then zone shelves. I learned how to use electric equipment, such as the electric pallet jack and walkie-stacker, how to stock a shelf and zone it properly, among other miscellaneous things such as how to use a hand-held scanner. Management was strict but fair, my co-workers were very much team players, with exception of a choice few. The hardest part of my job was when holidays when we recieved more freight than usual, but it was never too much than we could handle. Only one night did we have to push unworked stock into the backroom. The most enjoyable part was the sense of accomplishment that you felt when you successfully stocked your part of the store, that you were a sturdy piece of a jig-saw puzzle.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Jena, LA",1/12/16,2016,1,12

The management and my co-workers at this Wal Mart were really friendly and were helpful in showing me anything I didn't understand.

A lot of heavy lifting, climbing ladders, and working with power lifting equipment is done by me here. I am trained on both the electric jack and walkie stacker. I interact with multiple customers everyday. Either it be a customer asking for a particular product throughout the store or a customer asking for assistance in a particular department. I am capable of working in every department throughout the store but I am mostly stationed in the pet department. I scan bins in the backroom, create picks to be worked/stocked, then I stock those picks. My role in the company is an important one because whether or not a customer can find a product or is able to purchase a product is directly affected by how well or poor I do my job. I often have to stop my assigned task to help customers, other employees, or to simple take photographs of things throughout the store. Employee pictures, wrongdoings throughout the store, and promotional products throughout the store are a few examples of the many things I am asked to photograph. For the most part, I enjoy my work experience here and being able to interact with and learn from the many employees and customers that come in and out of the store on a day-to-day basis.",3,Current Employee,Inventory Management ,"Carrollton, GA",1/9/16,2016,1,9

"Not great, Not horrible","My time at Walmart was not all bad and I found my coworkers agreeable and even fun to work with, however management is less than stellar to be sure and a number of the company's systems and policies could use work. They are also reluctant to hire full time and therefore provide benefits for their employees, even those who have worked with them for an extended period. Moreover they seem none to eager to pay their employees, and by this I mean reluctant to offer greater hours and quity strict about the working of overtime—even when situations may demand it.

Unreasonable workload expectations and lazy coworkers,"My work was limited to the produce department - where I was the smallest and weakest member of my team. I enjoyed the work itself, for the most part - cleaning and prepping vegetables and going through displays for rotten produce can be weirdly calming. However, we were always short-staffed and I regularly found myself closing by myself. Not to mention that because we were short staffed, my coworkers regularly left extra work for me as they did not have the time to stop and log their donation/throw away items. So I got to do all of their work, clean the back room, and keep track of the floor. Suffice to say, something was always left out.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Saint George, UT",1/5/16,2016,1,5

Busy and interesting place to work,"A typical day was completing a four person job within a slotted time frame. I learned that quality is more important than speed. Completing a job the first time in a correct fashion saves time rather than doing it quickly and having to do it all over again. The kicker is learning to enforce quality and speed at the same time. Some jobs do take precedence over others but I do make sure all of my work is no where near sloppy. I easily became friends with all of my coworkers. Finding a common interest(s) in each of my coworkers is what led to successful friendships in and outside of the workplace. The hardest part of the job was staffing. At times it was a struggle to keep all customers happy when we were short-handed, but we did show them that we were giving them all that we had when it came to customer service. Repeat customers are what makes the company so successful. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a second family. I've heard many times that a job isn't a place for making friends, but I disagree. No, I don't believe in standing around and doing nothing but talking but it does make the job more enjoyable when you can pass by a coworker and exchange an inside joke and be able to pass on a smile.

"It's a constantly busy, routine oriented environment that offers a limited amount of advancment oppourtunities due to the large scale of the company.","My day as an unloader would begin with zoning the store (making sure the merchandise looks presentable) while helping customers out with questions about merchandise locations, questions about Walmart online, locating merchandise in the back room, and making sure that the customers have a pleasant experience. After zoning for two hours, I would proceed to the General Merchandise side of the store to unload the truck. Unloading the truck(s) entailed that I knew all the departments in the store and have the speed and capability to finish a truck within two hours. A usual truck would have 2,100 pieces of freight. After the truck is done we would then take the freight to the sales floor, all the while keeping customer safety a priority. After the freight was all taken to the floor on the GM side, we would head over to the opposite side of the store, the Grocery side and pull pallets to the floor. Most pallets from the GM side weigh from 3,000 to 5,000 pounds since pallet jacks can only carry so much weight.

Very busy enviroment,Come in and report to a CSM to receive a register to report to. depending on if they were paying attention I would get breaks only sometimes.

Enjoyable and learning experience,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. I will admit that it was definitely rough from time to time because it was a lot that you were blamed for by customers, that typically had nothing to do with you. As a cashier I had to always remember that we are the first and last faces that customers see when they come in and when they leave out of the store. I learned that I just have to be patient, be kind, wait and have understanding. Even if the customer is upset and may be yelling, they are not upset at me and that I always had to remain calm. Our management team there always came to our defense and respected both the customers and us as the cashiers. I loved working with my co-workers. We helped each other out in every way possible, working together as a team. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is being able to move on after having a really, really hard transaction because I work hard and I take my work seriously and I never liked to mess up and I still don't so my managers always helped me out and they understood because they knew how much of a perfectionist I was. I just really love to do my work well. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping out customers who really needed help finding something that they could not find or helping a cashier who was stuck on a transaction.

I quickly progressed from temporary Cashier to permaent part-time, then to layaway associate, assisting other departments as well, and then to Customer Service Manager. As a CSM I was totally abused within the store and overworked to the bone. They had us running a skeleton crew of front-end staffing most of the time but complained when customers were upset about lines or business of the store while not hiring enough staff to ensure proper staffing for the front end. On top of this, they constantly ""borrowed"" our front-end staff for other departments as the whole store was completely understaffed- leaving us even less covered. There were several times as well I was asked to manage or supervise other departments as well as my own, and be the sole supervisor on the front-end._x000D_All this, for peanuts._x000D_Don't get me wrong it is nice that Walmart has a 401k plan and quarterly bonuses (provided your store does well,) but there are a lot of issues where pay is concerned._x000D_I was not properly compensated to begin with, but with the recent ""minimum wage increase"" within Walmart stores, my position was TOTALLY and COMPLETELY neglected and looked over.

extremely stressful postiion.,"being an assistant manager for wal mart was very stressful due to the fact that we were responsible for every aspect of running the store. Upper Management rarely left their office to help during busy periods of the day, but never hesitated to utilize their walkie talkies to add on additional tasks for the day. Walmart boasted that it was all about family, yet was open every holiday but one. Salaried members of management were treated differently then hourly. We were not shown the respect that non-exempt employees were. Home office micromanaged through their WIRE system.  I would not work for Wal Mart again.",2,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Monaca, PA",12/28/15,2015,12,28

"I would not recommend any optometrist consider working in a Walmart in Englewood, CO.","If you consider working as an optometrist in Walmart, you may want to research the market manager with whom you will negotiate your terms.  I had a very poor landlord who never visited me in 1.5 years.  He put the optical's very large file cabinet in my space, the space that  I rent, without asking me.  He tried to hire someone for Saturdays without asking me.  I pay internet, phone, and marketing expenses, all of which another person would utilize without my consent.  But most of all, he does not care about patient care at all. He knows nothing about it and nor does he care.  My opinion is that they will eventually ask you to work 6-7 days per week, even the numbers don't support adding another day. _x000D_      He showed up one day and terminated my lease.  He refused to give me a reason.  I was stunned given that my practice was growing, I was seeing lots of Medicaid patients, and things were looking great, until he destroyed it.  If he wanted more hours or if something was going wrong, it should have been communicated to me. I would have negotiated with him if I had the chance.  They still have not found a doctor.  Beware!_x000D_     Also, you will not make much money after all of your expenses.  Insurance pays poorly.  There will be a lot of insurance claims to file, so I would recommend hiring a billing clerk.  This would be yet another expense.  You can count on about 75K per year or less.",1,Former Employee,Independent Optometrist ,"Englewood, CO",12/22/15,2015,12,22
Helping others,"Walmart eCommerce is very big at helping others. I liked participating in their programs to do so. Love the hours, 12 hour days 3 days a week. The management is very kind, very helpful, and very understanding. I learned its ok to voice opinions, and ask questions.

A lot of room for advancement if you are passionate  about retail sales.,"A typical day at work in the Walmart pharmacy consist of clocking in, normally different times every day, then going to the pharmacy to the designated work station determined by what time you work then doing your task there while helping patients and customers in a timely manner. Co-workere were all nice and management at this particular location are all nice and are good at there job. The main improvement management needs to make is learning how to communicate to other managers and associates better. The hardest part of the job was trying to get all of the tasks done before the pharmacy closed. Often times I would stay late between 30  min to 2 hours after the pharmacy closed just to get everything done which the district health and wellness manager did not like at all but we were severely understaffed for most of my time there. What I enjoyed most about the job would have to be the my share bonus and all the cook outs we would do. There was a cookout for a lot of random reasons from holiday celebrations to getting a good review from customers.",3,Former Employee,CERTIFIED PHARMACY TECHNICIAN ,"Kansas City, MO",12/22/15,2015,12,22
Non realistic time frame to complete a task,Day to day activities I have to help customers process a return and even pay bills or send money. Generally management have to be paged in order to do overrides and sometimes it takes them awhile to get to the customer service desk so it holds up other transactions. Co-workers are friendly and helpful especially when certain things are heavy to move onto or off a cart. Hardest part of the job is occasionally coming face to face with an irate customer. Not really great when it comes to management giving a tall order. (ie having to reset a 16 foot section of pasta sauce to redo and add in new products. was given only a 2 hour window to complete it while which customers cannot be ignored when they need an item),3,Former Employee,Customer Service Desk and Stocker and Cashier ,"Reno, NV",12/22/15,2015,12,22

The profit sharing was the best part of the job,I worked 40 hours a week morning hours through the week did some over time as called for. I utilized lots of customer service skills ineracting with co workers and the customers. The managment rarely ineraccted with the employees other than passing by saying hello unless there was something specific they wanted.

A few are friendly who will only get firm with coworkers if something needs to be done. However, a couple of managers are less friendly. One example involves a manager who would not listen to an explanation of a fallen over pallet, yet we were told that you could talk to anybody if needed. Another example is the firing process, where a few people were fired without warning, and this made the stocking workload larger and more hectic._x000D__x000D_-The hardest job would be the amount of freight on certain days, but the worse part is that sometimes the freight could possibly arrive two hours late._x000D__x000D_-The most enjoyable parts of the job was the ability to meet new people, and the ability to have a job at the hours I am awake was convenient as well.",4,Former Employee,Stocker Associate ,"Tyler, TX",12/21/15,2015,12,21

I would then stock the shelves with the product I had loaded. After that was finished I was finished stocking one isle I would move to the next. I was responsible for two to three isles in a night. There were nights that I would do extra departments if management needed extra help. I enjoyed the job I was given at Wal-Mart, and it was never a problem to handle the work load.

Retail as a life,"From the time I left high school, til the time I left the career of retail, I have many things to say. Work in one mans eyes differs from another. I took every opportunity to learn about the workers, the customers, and understanding the goals of retail. There was no daily demand, only the drive to push yourself and others to meet the goals that where place in front of you. Somethings where easier than others, but we stride to complete each goal on schedule. Listening and helping that next person that enter those double doors was the main part of communication. meeting there needs and expectations was far more important than grouping up and waiting for them to come to you. Yes, some people where the seekers, they knew what they wanted and got in and got out. I would have to say the hardest part of the job would have to be staffing. There was plenty of people to staff the the building but never enough hours to staff the people.  Some people grew discourage of this. They tend to look for jobs other places and what forth.

Life at Walmart,"I worked as a service desk associate at Walmart. A typical day was hectic. I was responsible for returning items, cashing checks, printing money orders, sending money via MoneyGram, assisting customers pay their bills, and occasionally being a cashier when the lines at the check out where too long. I learned how  to run the service desk and process returns and all other functions of the service desk. I learned how to search for receipts on the computer and check to see if we have items we have in stock. I directed customers to the correct departments where the items they wanted were located. I answered the phone and answered questions and transferred the calls accordingly.  To be honest I feel that the management structure, at least at my store, was far from the best that I have ever experience. They had favorites amongst  the employees and those were given preferential schedules. They were not there for their employees. If you went to them with concerns or if you had an idea of how something could be made easier you were ignored. Members of management would walk past as you as you were being verbally abused by customers. Overall it was not a good company to work for. The best part of the job I would have to say was some of the co-workers that I met while there. They became some of my closest friends and we are still good friends to this day.",3,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate ,"Plaistow, NH",12/17/15,2015,12,17

I also found that the older more reliable employees where often stuck in their original positions and passed over for advancement.

For some reason, every co-worker that came and went were AMAZING down-to-earth people, and remain my friends even after quitting. Management, however, was terrible. There were maybe 1-2 upper managers that i felt comfortable talking to at all. Most wouldnt even give me the time a day and treat the staff like garbage. The environment was terrible because of all the riff-raff customers that come through. I was sexually harrassed by many of them, and because of the management, never reported any of said customers. We got small raises yearly, but werent all that much. Hours were pretty good for part-time.There was one manager who denied everyones time-requests for apparently no reason, which was a big push for me leaving the store forever.

Rules that should apply to everyone only apply to the people who aren't friends or the favorites of the managers/supervisors. Certain areas of the store are allowed to listen to music while on shift while others aren't, even though the Store manager says no one is allowed to listen to music. _x000D__x000D_There's massive favoritism and bias when it comes to who does what.

"Not a bad place to work, but not a recommended position","The Courtesy Associate position, which could also be called a ""cart pusher,"" isn't a bad job at all. It's likely easier than what you imagine. I am not a particularly fit person, and can handle the work day without being tired or sore at the end of the shift. The managers tend to leave you alone if the job is being done fairly well, so you're left on your own with your fellow cart pushers. Most of the time, you are ignored by customers too, which is definitely a plus. Despite this, they do not allow you to listen to music (which they allowed us at one point, which was nice). _x000D__x000D_The main reason for the lower rating is opportunity. Being independent has its bad side, being that you're not really noticed for either good or bad work, unless you're in the extremities. If you have a reputation for either, you're pretty much stuck with it no matter how you improve or regress. Your job opportunity is only lateral movements (as, really, what skills are showcased in this position?), and that's only after a year of working (although they randomly ignore this requirement). Their restrictions on the discount and benefits feel like they're really trying their hardest to give you as little as they can. That said, once you work enough to get them, they're quite good. 10% discount on non-groceries and some exceptions (soda, PowerAde and Gatorade, produce, etc.) and MyShare bonuses are notable. _x000D__x000D_Another con is the repairs.

I try to ask them questions about the need of an item and use that information to help them make a decision.

The most enjoyable part of my job is making a customer happy with their selected purchase. My coworkers are my team mates.

Almost like high school especially if you are a female.I learned that no matter the salary or quality of work you do, if they can find a reason to dislike anything about you, you are doomed and will never excel. Management is only a title in Walmart, the people who hold those positions do not take it seriously. They are there for a check like most and have no real concern for each of their employees individually. Hardest part of the day was being micromanaged each working day and used because of my years with the company, knowledge and number of different stores I had worked in. I am military and worked when I was stateside in each duty station for extra income. I constantly changed pay brackets but always remained a cashier. After over 5 years of experience and getting out of the military, I was thrown into layaway and giving everyone breaks and lunches on a daily basis. I was never given opportunity to move up or into a department. I applied for many things, AP was ideal for me because of my military/security background. Other people who couldn't pass drug screens were chosen over me. When the truth came out, I was considered second but declined. I was placed at the service desk & money center for months because of shortages but never granted that position and the raise. I was told it was because of a meal violation from another state over a year ago. I found that odd that after the new year and basically running layaway by myself that a meal violation would pop up then and place a hold on me.

It's a great environment to sharpen your customer service skills. Coworkers in general are diverse ranging from all ages. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers who possess a great sense of humor. During a transaction as cashier it's a privilege for me to be able to smile back to a customers joke or compliment. I would say the hardest part of the job is transitioning from a completely different environment which is outdoors as a back up cart attendant. So from tending the cash register I have to switch and adapt to the outside nature when I'm collecting and pushing carts.

No. Most of the people I worked with for or under were really nice people. The customers, were generally pretty nice even when I worked as a cashier. It actually gets to the point you have regulars that will come in and stop by just to say hi. Honestly this job isn't much different than working in any other job for any other company that has almost no requirements for being eligible for being hired.

Poor Employee Treatment,"Overall not a terrible place to work, however most of the managers tend to gossip about their employees or would flat out lie to get others in trouble or to avoid getting themselves in trouble. Some managers had a issue with micro managing while playing favorites, letting some employees get away with slacking off and not working while coming down on others, giving contradicting ""advice"" (telling them to do one thing then punishing them for doing it). Yelling at employees on the floor and threatening their jobs in front of customers or even going as far as to badmouth a employee to customers, other staff, or managers. _x000D_Most work days included keeping isles straightened up and dealing with customers, however if you tend to be working mainly by yourself and getting in trouble for not being able to complete the job of multiple areas; even when there are multiple people in one area working you tend to get yelled at for not being able to do your own area as well as 2+ others by yourself._x000D_Co-workers were quite friendly and helpful but management was poor, getting onto employees who are on the clock and completed their job and helping fellow co-workers._x000D_Over-all I have not learned very much do to a lack luster training program, with little help once you are on the floor with managers singling one person out for a problem with a group of employees._x000D_The hardest part of the job, by far, is dealing with management, it's hard getting your job done when you get yelled at for doing your job and watching people who do less work than you and some co-workers get away with it because they - more...",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Dry Ridge, KY",12/3/15,2015,12,3

Ideas brought to the management staff were thrown into the trash or said management staff would take credit for them.  There were some good aspects to the job as in there are those that still care about proper customer service and who are willing to work with their fellow associates to strive for excellence but those numbers are dwindling quickly as the upper management implement ideas that are not very helpful to the associate or the customer at all.,2,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"York, PA",12/1/15,2015,12,1

"Liked co-workers, not company","I got along well with those that I worked with directly, but had issues with those on the other shifts not pulling their weight.

Constant Turnover,Love the job enjoyed the associates however upper management no clue of how to manage other then threats Worked 7 years and was always placed on overnights when asked to go to days never got to go.

The job is not so bad but management is almost nonexistent.,"A typical day at my job is just stocking the floor with products we may be missing. When i have completed that, i then package all breads and pastries. After all that i then close the bakery by sweeping, and mopping the floors. I have learned how to be patient with customers, make cupcakes/cakes, and write on cakes when needed. Management at my job is horrible. Every time me or the bakery need help with something no one ever comes. The managers usually always have a bad attitude or just in general look like they hate their job. Also when they say they will work with your schedule for college, that is not true! In all honesty they don't care if you go to school or not. All they care about is you going to work everyday. The hardest part of the job is not having any support from your managers or supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet and the amazing friendships you make with your coworkers.",3,Current Employee,Bakery Sales Associate ,"Manor, TX",11/30/15,2015,11,30

Great place to work for multi-taskers,"Work at this particular job was always different from day to day. Management was always contradicting each other with daily activities of employees. The hardest part about this job was being able to finish all my duties due to the lack of work done by my coworkers earlier in the same area.

Enjoyable place to work.,This was a great company in order to learn many skills in retail and customer service.  I enjoyed learning about the products and the friendships amongst the employees.   While I think the incentive programs were great the acknowledgement from the top of the company was lacking.  However big corporations cant help that I suppose.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate / Cashier ,"Rochester, MN",11/30/15,2015,11,30
"A nice place to work, fun associates and customers. Must like to be able to accept change regularly. A fast paced keep moving place to work.","I have been with Wal-Mart 17 years, and a lot of things have changed since I started in 1998. Technology has played a big role in the development of Wal-Mart, it seems every month or so some new way to run our mc-40 comes up. It is'nt always for the better, but we always change to the Wal-Mart way. Wal-Mart has been a very good company for me to work for. They have treated me good. In a typical day I will put up freight, do price changes, ordering, planning for the next week, or month. I especially like to interact with the customers, I am a people person, and try to make sure our customers find and get all that they come for. Some just like a little conversation and thats ok. If something unexpected comes up that needs done, management usually ask me to get it done. Wal-mart has over 300 associates, and some of them are new, I see new faces more and more, probably due to the holidays coming up. I love a good challenge, I have worked in 7 dept. in my Wal-Mart career and they have all taught me differant aspeces of the company.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Summersville, WV",11/30/15,2015,11,30

fun place to work,"It was great working with the other folks in my department.  We had fun and the customers were generally great to talk to.  It was hard, dirty, greasy work, but it felt good at the end of the day to know I did a good day's work.  The worst was the management who didn't seem interested in adjusting my schedule due to personal situations on the home front.  It was frustrating having different managers at different times of the year and and adjusting to the various personalities which led to my departure because the first manager was sympathetic to my situation and the next wasn't. Just to clarify, I was dealing with a deployed spouse situation and needed to make adjustments so I could be home at certain times with my 4 children; the first manager was very understanding and the second wasn't.",4,Former Employee,Deli Clerk ,"Warrensburg, MO",11/30/15,2015,11,30
management is horrible,"the job itself is not hard at all. you unload pallets and put stuff on shelves. The downfall is management. Youre hired and thrown to the wolves with VERY little training. Your best bet is working with someone nice enough to show you the ropes. If not then youre pretty much on your own. Despite not actually training anyone management still felt the need to hassle everyone when freight didnt get done. Now not all managers were bad. There were 2 that worked on my shift. One just didnt care, didnt assign tasks or give anyone any direction. The other gave too much direction, felt the need to actually scream at  people, make them cry and at least once a week gave a speech about how slow everyone was.",2,Former Employee,overnight stocker ,"Shawnee, KS",11/30/15,2015,11,30

retail/office setting,"I worked Walmart as a front end associate before being promoted to the vision center. When working the front end I had to maintain a clean work space, help customers with checking out, getting carts when none were available. I also had to work the service desk and money center. For everything I did on the front end the pay wasn't enough so I applied for the vision center to further my career. When I worked in the vision center it was slow at first but became fast paced. Helped customers with selecting glasses and doing contact lens training. The training could have been better for the vision center especially with using laboratory equipment. I felt so lost sometimes because I couldn't verify a prescription properly on certain equipment because I wasn't trained or it was outdated.",3,Former Employee,Optician in the Vision Center ,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",11/30/15,2015,11,30
Im glad i got the exsperience,"I have worked at walmart for some years now. I enjoy the coworkers and the regular customers that come in just to speak to me. I also have a few managers that see me hard work and thank me for the dedecation.

Youll be a grunt while your an Orderfiller and people will dislike you while in training,The job duties are pretty routine and once you get it down its fairly easy. The job relies on team work but there is rarely any given by coworkers or managment. But it is possible to complete your job with  little help from others. Unless you make a name for yourself by being selfless and doing alot of other peoples jobs while still excelling at your job you will be just a number. But if you do very well at your job they will show favor to you. You start out at the highest paying job in the company which for me was kind of depressing. There are areas to move around for less demanding jobs but they are in high demand. They say you need to be employed there for a year but you will see people that have been there for 3 months and are able to transfer. I believe if you are good at moving fast waking up early youll do great. Must stay physically fit as well. Ask ALOT of questions.,3,Former Employee,Cold Area Orderfiller ,"Temple, TX",11/30/15,2015,11,30

"Down to earth yet fast workplace, but poor store management and communication.","Walmart is NOT THAT bad of a place to work nor shop at, but it's still Walmart and it still manages to hold up to it's poor reputation. Most co-workers were easy to get along with and some supervisors were down to Earth people. Times got fun every now and then, however- due to the ""down to earth"" atmosphere the store had, many consequences developed. Sometimes it was TOO relaxing, therefore, that led to lack of communication, poor management and overall lack of proper training. When new updates came out for registers or when employees were required to ask customers certain things, most of us were rarely informed, yet alone given a small, quick rundown of what's going on and what is expected. It was each man (woman) for their own, and that really turned away many associates, especially newer ones, due to sudden change without warning nor explanation. I don't those that were upset or those that left for times could get overwhelming in a high volume, high traffic store like Walmart. So when sudden, unexpected change with no help came plowing through, it only stressed a good deal of employees and alienated them. It drove them away. Working there was alright, but the huge lack of communication between managers, supervisors, and lower level employees was disgusting and worked for no one there.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service/Layaway Associate ,"Yuba City, CA",11/28/15,2015,11,28

Boring and under paid,I worked in the dairy department. Soooo boring but it was valuable because now I know what to look for when I go to shop. The shift before mine was always leaving colossal messes like spilled milk everywhere and of course customers got snippy over goats milk or something silly like I am management and have control over everything there. My co-worker was the sweetest lady and she was the best part of my job. Its alot of rotating inventory cleaning messes  and mopping.

Inventory control 3rd shift,"Come in, search for a telxon and waste 30 minutes because previous shifts would hide them all around the store. Pick until lunch and usually get yelled at or have to stay late because they were not finished. Do the work of 4 people because those hired are incapable of doing simple tasks, especially alone. Said people can not team up or no work is accomplished. After lunch we bin and finish special projects. Also given grief from management if everything is not binned by the end of the shift even though we were under staffed and picking up the slack of those who I talked about previously. Management expects too much of those who do work and do not give any attention to those who do not pull their weight. The job is easy, you just have those people who don't care and would rather do nothing at their ""job"".

A harsh retail environment with poor management.,"The store I worked at was one of the better stores to shop at in my area, but it was not a good place to work. The store managers were out of touch with the employees and they had unnecessarily high expectations of associates. I enjoyed working with the group of cashiers at my store but that was the best part of my job. The position I had was the cashier supervisor and the person in charge of the front end, that meant if a customer got upset it was my job to make them happy. The management would routinely ignore calls for assistance with customers problems resulting in a very unsatisfied customer by the time the manager found the time to assist. To Walmart all that matters is numbers and getting the most that they can out of their associates without giving them anything in return. I would not recommend anyone work for that corporation.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Winston-Salem, NC",11/23/15,2015,11,23

Inventory Management System,"I started out as a cashier, which was my first job. I was a good customer service rep. I was always smiling and making others smile and happy, I was also fast at checkout and always helped customers if it was needed. After about 7 months I think, I then became an unloader. I was to unload trucks with a few others and organize them on pallets or L-carts. We would then take the pallets and L-carts out on the floor and to the areas of where those products belong so that the 3rd shift crew would stock as much as they could. There was heavy lifting required, messy spills to clean up and lots of cleanup involved. The team was then named IMS after about 2 months and we were to control inventory counts and locations in the back room of the store. If the Telezon said that the item was able to be stocked on the floor we had to pick that from its location and send it out to be stock and anything that could not be stocked we had to find a place to put it and enter it in on the system. Working I learned that customers are number 1, they always come first. The store I worked out was a small place and everyone that work there knew each other, therefor, there was a lot of confusion between a lot of people there. The best part about working there was the physical labor that I endured. I loved the physical ability that I had there._x000D_The hardest part about the job would be time, completing things on time or before time. We only had 4 people throwing and unloading the semi's and they wanted the trucks unloaded at an unreasonable time.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/IMS ,"Delaware, OH",11/23/15,2015,11,23

A nice place to work,Excluding the crazy policies and guidelines Walmart employees have to follow there isn't anything wrong with working at Walmart. The absence policy is ridiculous. They require you to go through the associate website and then call a 1-800 number. After doing all of these things you'll still be penalized and possibly coached for following a procedure that they constructed. Working on the front end  can be disastrous for life outside of Walmart because of the likelihood of the fluctuating schedules interrupting other plans you had for the day. Sometimes management can be stiff in terms of changing your availability to suit your needs. This isn't much of a problem for backroom associates and stockers as they tend to have set schedules. Walmart is a great place to work as long as you do your job and stay out of trouble.,4,Former Employee,IMS ASSOCIATE ,"Lithonia, GA",11/22/15,2015,11,22

In the Afternoon if I started work I would have to set up my maid cart for the other maintenance associates while I would set up for the delivery trucks.

I enjoyed making above minimum wage , and here I also worked with really awesome people. I didn't like how predictable each night was going to be.

After that stock the location on a timed schedule, while watching shelf caps and rotating product. After everything was in its place would have to take additional left over product to the back to be properly put away. I would then go to my area and make it presentable as well as clean up an mess I might have behind. I would help with cashiering as well as backroom work. I made it a point to try and get trained for everything to be more accessible. The down fall of the place was some of the shoppers that would come in at the late hours some just rude and some just crossing the line of comfort.

Loved the overnight shift!,"I really liked working at Walmart.  I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it.  It was fast paced and very challenging to meet deadlines.  I found that you need a very good work ethic and a love for being efficient and for service to be good at any job, including stocking shelves!  I loved working in various departments and depending on the manager on shift, I was moved around quite a bit.  I loved the Health and Beauty, Food and the Pharmacy departments the best.  The hardest for me was working in apparel mainly because of understaffing in that department.  Unlike other departments I stocked in, I was left with a sense of lack of accomplishment because goals where not met.    I also feel that the manager's attitude affect employees and job culture. I had two managers who worked on different days.  I worked very well with one manager who saw my strengths and my strong work ethic.  The other manager seemed to play favorites and kept me in a department where I felt ill equipped and not supported. It played a major part in the reason why I had to leave Walmart.  _x000D__x000D_I worked at Walmart in between making a change of career choice.  I strongly considered staying at Walmart instead of going into the healthcare field because I loved working there so much.  I still feel joyous when I think about my time there,  how much I loved that job and how I wished things would have been a little different managerially.  I probably still be there despite getting training in something else.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Bensalem, PA",11/18/15,2015,11,18
"Excellent systems,but changes are too frequent, rigid & varied between locations/upper Management to create an environment of confidence/satisfaction","I loved Walmart for many years, as their hours, pay, and support staffing was such that it allowed for more reasonable accomplishment of necessary tasks throughout the day! The computer system was excellent, as was the ability to minimize errors or realize counseling opportunities or medication changes through additional systems. During the initial 6-7 years, pharmacists were treated with value and even when store staff/management weren't on the same page, we got support for our needs from our own upper management. Unfortunately, the last few years saw drastic changes, which created mostly negative impacts to patient care and staff morale. The budget was continually cut, while the demands increased exponentially! I have worked in Many different Pharmacy environments and many of those were different types of Retail settings. The way they conducted business was, of course, different everywhere, so I wasn't surprised by much, nor did I have difficulty finding ways to work with the system to the benefit of the company and patients!  The changes at Walmart are still a work in progress, but without consistency with each store/pharmacist, or supervisor that takes over, the ability to do well or even maintain is being hindered more than the overall changes, restrictions or expectations.",3,Current Employee,Pharmacy Manager ,"Cocoa, FL",11/18/15,2015,11,18

Worth having if you only need a part time job,"The pay scale is laughable, the benefits package is a joke, and it's just not worth it for a full time, sole income job. They tend to all but manipulate you into working extra hours, and then force you to cut the extra hours that you earned to prevent having to pay out overtime.

Providing good customer service and getting the customer through the check out line in an accurate and timely fashion.

Brainwashing Meets Capitalism,"Alright kids get comfortable because I am about to tell you a story. I applied to walmart fresh out of high school, because I really can't afford college and I wanted to job while I figured what I was gonna do. So I already knew that walmart was a bad employer, I mean even a friend wrote her final paper about it for english. So you go in for orientation which is really 5+ hours of brainwashing. They tell you all about how all employees are treated equally and how this company will really let you soar over time, it's all propaganda. Luckily there was an associate there that knew better, they let me go through my corporate phase but as soon as feces started hitting the fan, they were there to walk me through it. Everything started going downhill when our original assistant manager was moved to another shift. The company never really bothered with getting us a new one so were manager-less for months. As a mere associate, if you were to breathe in a way not approved by a manager, you would get a coaching, but more on that later. My department was a total disaster 80% of the time, all the department managers ever did was fuss around with freight and then complain that they always had pallets in the back. There was one manager in particular that didn't have anything binned, so if a customer was looking for jeans or a shirt in a certain size, you might as well be looking for a needle in a haystack. Upper management knew of this but they never talked to her about it, even though it was clearly upsetting the customers and it wasn't convenient for the workers.

The assistant managers expected me to get the work of two or three maintenance associates or janitors done by myself. There was always fires to put out, the customers were rude, I never got any help when I asked for it and I was responsible for keeping the work associate's break room clean when they should have done it themselves. My pay was terrible and when I asked for a raise when the allotted time had passed for one, I never got it, I was still earning the same wage I started with by the time I quit. I did get time and a half on Sundays but that wasn't enough to compensate what I was earning per hour.

Productive Workplace Crew is Like Family.,"A typical Day at work was Scrubbing down every cash register, stocking the Smoke Box and impulse items. I learned how to stock items, and how to deal with rude or impatient customers. Management at Walmart is a joke. They do not talk to each other, they just simply send one person on a wild goose chase all night, so they can't achieve anything, but they yell at you the whole time while you try to do what each manager has asked. The Co-Workers were the best part of the job by far. That place is like a giant family and those workers stick together and work very hard.

Mediocre place to work with mediocre compensation,Working at Walmart is not enjoyable or glamorous. It is quite the opposite. When you aren't sitting around doing nothing you are being pushed around by rude and impatient customers. The management team is just as lazy as the entry level workers.

Extremely stressful for all salaried members of mgmt in that mgmt picks up work load left by all hourly associates but mgmt is paid very handsomely.  Most important thing learned during my 14 yrs of retail mgmt with Walmart is that no matter what, Walmart is at the top the food chain when it comes to retail.  They retain talent at the mgmt level because they pay their managers.  Mgmt oftern times stay simply because no other retailer pays what Walmart pays at the different levels of mgmt.  But taking that in consideration, many mgrs trade high pay for high stress and a definite lack of work life balance.

Good people in a hard place.,"Wal-Mart started out with a vision of making shopping for every day items delightful and hassle free for customers.  While this was/is the goal of the company, many customers can't tell this to be true.  Working at Wal-Mart was a good experience for me in that I would have the professional experience to carry on to other jobs, but it felt to be lacking the customer satisfactory experience.  Management often puts down it's associates, and in turn expects them to want to stay late to help them keep the store in top shape.  It is my opinion that this creates a hostile work environment, which carries out not just through the chain of employees, but also through to the customers.  It's hard to make a customer happy when someone higher up is making the employee feel unwelcome, and unappreciated.",3,Former Employee,Unloader ,"Yukon, OK",11/12/15,2015,11,12

Customer Service/ Cashier review,"Typical workday would include clocking in exactly on time, getting your daily assignment from either the supervisor on floor or from the terminal. Once you've received your assignment you'd go at it for about 2 hours before getting a 10 minute break (15 if the supervisor was willing to give you extra time to finish whatever it was you were doing such as eating, applying for vacation, using the bathroom,etc.). If you worked customer service you'd go take claims, do exchanges, and returns. HOWEVER as a customer service representative you'd get trained to uphold policy, but if the customer was non-compliant with the policy you'd have to offer them a supervisor who most of the time (in my experience 33% of the time) would approve of a refund or exchange of the product that was in no where near returnable such as bra's, used grills, worn clothing, milk bought 3+ days prior, etc. That would basically be your entire shift, dealing with customers problems, as well as answering calls from other departments/ customers to help with any questions to your fullest ability.  All those tasks would be performed until your scheduled work time was over._x000D__x000D__x000D_For cashiers you'd be assigned a register and help customers checkout while providing friendly service.

My colleagues made the job a pleasure to come to work.,The employees were constantly trained in all aspect of the job requirements. Although management was firm and intensive at times there were many opportunities to express ones view point. The hours fluctuated widely. I enjoy the part of the job of working with an international community of people and learning not only job skills but different cultural sensitivities. The working atmosphere in many department was cooperative but the management styles were not consistent. The lack of irresponsible workers was a constant determent to others. They offered weekly and holiday incentives. We also participated in many charitable work and contest that made it fun to be a part of. Yearly inventories were not well organized and double the work of many associates. They encourage inside growth and made it possible for anybody to train and become successful in their advancement.

Always Busy! Which is fine.,"Walmart is a pretty good place to work, if you don't have many goals of going anywhere. There is very little room for advancement and when there are available positions, they typically go to the Assistant Manager's favorite (the butt-kissers.) My very first day of the job, I was not greeted nor were there instructions, a manager, or coworker in sight. I had to tag someone down from a different department to ask what I should do. Then, the manager had the audacity to get mad at me by how I was working, which was simply folding clothes; of course, after leaving me at work by myself which no instructions. I basically taught myself everything within a few weeks and became the manager's first choice when it came to things. If you take this job and you're on the sales floor, be prepared to hear MANY DIFFERENT instructions by multiple managers! Also, be prepared to teach yourself almost everything. It's a good job for people who don't mind grinding! If you're used to getting everything handed to you, this shouldn't be your first choice.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Suffolk, VA",11/7/15,2015,11,7

Wal-Mart is not an enjoyable place to work at.,"After leaving 4B's I went to work at Wal-Mart, it was fairly new and seemed like a good place to work at. I started out as a cashier and quickly moved up to a trainer and to the customer service area. I enjoyed training because it allowed for more interaction with employees and customers.

A decent place to work.,"You know over all it wasn't a bad place to work. Just towards the end of me working there I was really burnt out so I decided it would be better for everyone if I were to leave and try to do something different. There are members of management within the company that will help you when you need it and a lot of the management is actually very nice, or at least at my store this was the case. Within this company there are indeed opportunities to rise up in positions. Though you have to be very self motivated. No one offers you a position unless you're perfect for it and even then you may not get the position. because within this company they operate on you applying yourself and actually telling management, ""hey, I'm interested in that job position"" And then you would be interviewed with other potential candidates if it was a position ""up for grabs"". But it's definitely a company you can learn and grow with. I know I sure learned a lot in the two years I was there.",4,Former Employee,Home Sales Associate ,"Eagle Point, OR",11/6/15,2015,11,6

Hard work not enough pay,We had several managers telling us different things to do. If one told you to do one thing another from another department came and told you to do something else. Most departments were unorganized and under staffed.,2,Former Employee,Soft line Sales Associate ,"Memphis, TN",11/6/15,2015,11,6
Things I learned,In my first year working for Wal Mart I had a great time I was eager to learn and excited to go to work everyday. I learned so much in my first year. After the first year our store manager left he was promoted and then slowly things began to change the workers were laid off left and right and we were short staffed all the time. Though thinking that this will change and being told for a long time they were hiring more people in I stepped up to the plate and worked whenever they would need me doing any job and helping in anyway possible. Then after sometime i got worn down and could no longer keep up with the demand they had for my services and even got injured while trying to help. When i finally left my employment with Wal Mart to be honest it was a relief to me and what felt like a never ending dead end job. But to this corporation I am grateful if not for them i am not sure anyone would have given a kid like me a chance to learn anything new. I take the skills and the things i learned from this place and all the wonderful times i have had and move on to a new adventure with a new job and career.,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Sales Associate ,"La Vista, NE",11/6/15,2015,11,6

A friendly place with nice people,"A friendly place where the opportunity of communication and making work-related relationships is provided. My learning includes gaining promotional team working and communication skills. The management is collaborative and caring in spite of a few leadership errors. Having nice and helpful co-workers has definitely been a strong positive point of my workplace. Standing for a long time on my feet used to be a bit hard at the first, but it never bothers me anymore. Achieving new experiences every day has been the most enjoyable part of the job. For example, I was so excited when I experienced working as a customer service associate for the first time.",3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Allen, TX",11/6/15,2015,11,6

Great pay and benifits,"Every day was different, you never really knew what you were going to walk into. I learned a lot about how to run a successful business and how to grow sales. I learned how to be a leader the right way, by making people want to follow you and not just demanding that things get done. By teaching and training and using discipline as a last resort not a first. The hardest part of the job is missing my family. It wasn't unusual to work a 12-15hr day, but the pay and benefits were really good. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people. Helping the customers by helping them find the things they needed at a great price, but what I really enjoyed was helping the associates. Most management there don't view out associates as customers, but they kind of are. It is just as important to build a relationship with them as it is to build one with the customer.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Cheboygan, MI",11/6/15,2015,11,6

"Exciting, fast-paced environment to work in",At this Walmart you can expect to learn most aspects of working in each position from slicing deli meat to working freight. As a manager this is perfect as I won't ask an associate to do something I won't do myself. The hardest part of the job is gaining as many skills and as much knowledge as fast as possible.

Cashiering,"A typical day for me at work had originally been coming in, taking control of whichever register needed to be occupied, covering others breaks and enduring however long it felt until your break(s). It was highly convenient having the grocery section, a deli and other functions literally in walking distance from your station. Most often, it was tiring listening to the same complaints from people about not wanting to participate in our credit card program and arguing with relentless customers about how they thought they were correct in how they understood our coupon and AD matching policies. Once I switched over to the pharmacy, I felt more capable handling not only ringing out orders, but processing prescriptions and handling the shelves. It was amazing to be able to say ""yes"" more often than ""no, that's not allowed"". management changed dramatically in the switch. Instead of being left to solve problems for myself and trusting in myself that I had done a good job with the customers, I now am critiqued every single time the manager sees anything that he personally saw as a mistake, like posture when standing, not showing my hands, word for word responding to customers and other minor details that were never considered on the front-lines. Nothing that broke the rules, but still not as he preferred, like speaking a few simple words of Spanish to ask ""What are you looking for?"" to the Spanish-speaking customers, though I am not certified to translate medical information. He is incredibly conscientious of image.

The Pros and Cons of Retail,"I've worked for the Walmart in Magnolia AR for almost 8 years now, and at times I've wondered if company at large expects these stores to run themselves. The worst part of the job (at least at Magnolia AR Wal-Mart): Scheduling is an utter nightmare. _x000D__x000D_I'm an apparel associate primarily, but most of the time I find myself constantly called out of my department to work as a cashier (because there's either no one scheduled or they called in), cutting fabrics (again no one scheduled/call in), working electronics/site to store (once more, no one scheduled/call in), bakery (need I repeat?) and so on, sometimes all in the same day. I don't mind the work necessarily (I'm willing to learn any job), but it's the employees that have to deal with the irritated/angry customers who have been waiting for service in areas with no one there (because again not enough people and one person can't be in five places at once) and that isn't exactly fun or fair to the either the employee or the customer. It's utter ridiculousness and half the time we can't get an answer from said management team as to why the scheduling is so inadequate. That's one of the major cons at Wal-Mart  that I don't think will ever be fixed. This is a pretty typical work day. _x000D__x000D_Despite the scheduling, most of the people I work with I consider good friends with some being people I've known my whole life to some that I've met working here and built a rapport. We all work hard and try to make the best of the situation when scheduling betrays us. The most enjoyable part is meeting people and making new friends.

They have company BBQs and other stuff to feed us. Safe to say you'll have at least one free meal per week because they do stuff almost all the time._x000D__x000D_My position was loader. You basically load a trailer with product coming down a conveyor belt and stack it as terrible as possible to make the Wal-Mart employee that's getting paid $7.25/hr to unload your mess quit his job._x000D__x000D_Turnover rate for loader position was 85% and is probably the only position a newcomer can get, so let that sink in before you apply. Loader, even though it pays the same, is often seen as the trial period for employees because after 3 months they can move to easier jobs. But even though another position has less work, there is more responsibility and you're held accountable for nearly everything._x000D__x000D_One thing I didn't like was this one position where you just watch product fly by and make sure the bar codes are facing up. You stand there all night and barely move or lift anything. They always stuck the women up there; even the female newcomers would get first dibs on that CAKE - more...",4,Former Employee,Loader ,"New Braunfels, TX",10/27/15,2015,10,27
Fun work place with nice coworkers and managers,Walmart can seem easy but its not. Theres a lot we have to deal with. Whether it be cleaning up a mess or lifting heavy items so we can get it where it needs to be or even just getting up early.

Working at WalMart,"My day starts, generally, at 0400. From the time I clock in to the time I clock out, I am moving almost constantly. On a slow day, I walk about five miles. The exercise is great. I am often times on a ladder, and lift items up to 50 lbs. My co-workers are younger, for the most part, and make the job fun.

You will learn alot about customer service,Wal-mart was the best and worst job I ever had. I learned customer service from both the merchant side as well as the customer side. I learned how to value the fact that the customer could have gone somewhere else but they decided to do business with you. So what that ment to me was that I needed to take care of them the same way that I desired to be treated. The hardest part of the job was the customers at times as well as management not backing you up and changing your schedule a lot. The most enjoyable part was learning something new and training my associates to do the same so that we were all on the same page.,3,Former Employee,Merchandise Supervisor ,"Houston, TX",10/26/15,2015,10,26
Service with a Smile,"I have never worked for a company more frustrating, draining, or demotivating like this one. Retail work in itself is no picnic but working for a large store like this one is a nightmare because of the standards tacked on by the public._x000D_honestly the customers aren't bad, you rarely find angry or openly hostile customers, mostly just very misinformed individuals you have to correct constantly. What makes this place so awful is the staffing. There is no standard for hiring. Once you're in, it's extremely hard to be fired because anything short of stealing from the company only gets you a write up. There's way too much wiggle room and sometimes it seems they go out of their way to hire the most useless individuals to work there. My location is very busy and is a magnet for drug users as well. Several employees, who left before they could be fired, have walked through my section absolutely reeking of drugs of alcohol. I've worked with several people who cannot complete a job to save their life. The laziest, most unmotivated people with the simplest bandaid solutions to problems. Worse still is the attitude of the management. If they aren't pulling their weight, the managers want you to pick up the slack. You do the job of five people minimum with the hours of half a person and the pay of an impoverished refugee. I've see homeless people better off than some of our employees._x000D__x000D_There are work benefits. You get a discount card applicable to wal-mart purchases that sometimes works.

During the training, they unfortunately skipped some essential, very helpful things to know but they do help you learn how to run a register and how to handle certain difficult situations that may occure. Some of the management would take their time to get to you when, for example, you order money for you register because it is running low. On the other hand, they are very easy to get along with and I have respect for them because of what they have had to deal with. My coworkers are very diverse and for the most part friendly. They had helped me immensely throughout working there.

I would wait on customers and during down time help pharmacist with filling and filing medications. I would clean and organize making sure newer medications were behind the ones closer to expiring. I enjoyed working with most of the co-workers although there was a couple who were a little difficult to work with. The hardest part of my job was when the lines would get long, the customers would take it out on me, or if the insurance didn't cover a medication, or if it wasn't ready yet. I understand time is important to everyone, and I understand when you are not feeling well it is difficult to be patient. I would stay in control and understanding. I would calmly talk with the customer and explain the situation to them and offer to do what ever was in my ability to assist them to the best that I could. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers and getting to know each one. some were there regularly to get medications for a pet, a loved one or themselves and would talk to us about that person/pet. so we became friends, someone who cared and listened.

One of the worst places i have had the displeaseure to work at!!!,"I was hired on as an ""External"" employee here in July. I figured that I was done with my previous employer, Toys R Us and that it was time for me to take the next step in my career...... Boy was I wrong!!! First off they put you in a class in either Phoenix or Dallas (I was in the Phoenix classes) for six weeks if you are an ""External"" employee, then proceed to continue to distance you from the other trainees that are ""Internal"" like you have a communicable disease or something, THEY DO NOT TEACH YOU ANYTHING IN THESE CLASSES!!! All I learned in these classes were how to run and analyze reports that I dont even use out in the field!!! The idea is that they want you to learn the information on your own, well that could work only if there were enough facilities for the trainees to use! When we were in our ""Host"" stores, we had to fight tooth and nail for the precious computer time as we had to fight amongst not only each other, but the associates that work in the store everyday. The Facilitators (instructors) were smug and almost always re-directed questions that could've been answered if they would get off of Facebook and do their job, but whatever. I ""graduated"" the four week program and had just two more weeks left in my Host store to do ""OJT"". This was a huge joke! The person i was to shadow was never in the office but two days out of my whole two weeks there, so i finished out my last two weeks clueless as to how to actually do my job.

Easy Hiring but Problems with Management Support,"I enjoy working for Wal-Mart because of the support system you get and ability to advance when you start working there. However the higher up on the chain the worse your support is from management. The co-workers all work hard and are treated fairly, so I never really have an issue with them. Job responsibilities increase drastically due to a lack of hiring more help, thus you are often overloaded with responsibilities that become expectations. Wal-Mart is great for anyone looking to get a job asap, but for long-term careers, it is better to find appreciation elsewhere. The jobs are now becoming consolidated because of the pay increases, but it doesn't make the jobs easier. I started as a Cash Office associate and now am an Office Associate (Invoice and A/P), however my job responsibilities now include my office associate responsibilities, pt cash office on weekends, assisting receiving associate, process donations, retrieve mail, do vendor payment research, floor research, ordering supplies, and helping out with any requests management has. I learned it is great to find a job with responsibilities, but you also must be able to grasp that others, especially management, will not always have your back.

Not the place for every body,"Walmart is not as bad a place as the rap it tends to get in the media. It's just not necessary the place for everybody. I was never meant to be a lifer at Wal-Mart, it provide for my family at the time.",3,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Greenville, AL",10/23/15,2015,10,23
"Seems like a good job at orientation, is a whack job on the salesfloor","Walmart treats their employees like children, and handles problems with workers on the sales floor in a very inappropriate way. They never make their schedules consistent and require you to ask off three weeks in advance only to approve the requested off day and still schedule you on said day. Also, they have a bad habit of scheduling you outside of your availability, despite the claim that a computer makes the scheduling based on your available hours. Personally, I was desperate for a job and they were the only place hiring at the moment but I would have much rather waited for a better job than make this mistake twice! Walmart really DOES NOT care about its employees and treats them like dirt. At least a dozen people quit daily, and the above stated reasons are only a handful of the probably thousands of reasons why! I fortunately am not a cashier, who have a ton more complaints than I, and I also do not work in the backroom as a stocker, which also have their own list of complaints. If anyone is looking for a job, DO NOT go to Walmart, they are awful employers.",1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Murfreesboro, TN",10/23/15,2015,10,23

I was fortunate enough to survive one horrible store manager and become good friends w/ his replacement, who happens to be a PHENOMENAL store manager. During the holidays and black Friday, being an employee is especially rewarding because there are so many more customers to help and make happy.

My co-workers were kind and we all worked well together as a team until we lost all but two of us and then while we were still kind and worked well together the work itself really overwhelmed us and it became very difficult for us too keep up with the work so then we both felt defeated and without the support we needed to keep our department at it's best.

Productive and great managers and employees to work with,"A typical day at work would be known as the cashiers always getting our job done but we always had our own time to have fun. We always made our job fun and if someone was having a bad day, we would always try to make it better for them. I learned a lot working for Wal-Mart, from learning the cashier and memorizing the different codes for fruits and vegetables. As an overnight stocker I learned how to look up items on the telxon if needed. I would say the hardest part about being an overnight stocker, I had to cashier as well so it became difficult on some nights to fully get our job done when you constantly have someone coming through the checkout line. The most enjoyable part of being a day time cashier was that we as cashiers always had a good time, even while working.",5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker/Cashier ,"Moore, OK",10/21/15,2015,10,21

The people I worked with were always kind to me and treated me like I was family.

The hardest part about doing what I do is making sure everything is where it needs to be in totes and getting groceries delivered on time as there are complications. However, Without what i learned from walmart, I would not have learned how to handle such task and make new friends along the way, with my co workers and more so my customers",5,Current Employee,Order Fulfillment Associate ,"Longmont, CO",10/21/15,2015,10,21

Fun Work Environment,I learned many things from Wal-Mart and for that I am grateful. I learned how to be a better leader and how to work more efficiently under pressure. The best part of the job was the friends I met along the way and the sense of belonging. Management over the years began to shift from focusing on the betterment of the associates to focusing on how to make associates accountable for pages and pages of notes. This dynamic is something that proved very overwhelming for me due to the lack of hired help. I enjoyed everything about the job itself and I am glad to have had the opportunity to work there and learn all these essential skills.,4,Former Employee,Consumables zone manager ,"Suffolk, VA",10/21/15,2015,10,21
Nice hours but management is annoying,"Management thinks Walmart is God's gift to this green earth and you are lucky to work there. Aside from that, typical day is show up and stand at the register and ring people through. Occasionally cover people's breaks at the fitting room or fold clothes if the front is slow. Co-workers are nice and helpful. Hardest part of the job is waiting 20 minutes for a CSM to bring you quarters because they're too busy goofing around at the service desk. Most enjoyable is nice customers.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Monaca, Pennsylvania, USA",10/21/15,2015,10,21
Productive and busy workplace.,At Wal-Mart there is always something to do to keep yourself busy. If you did not have anyone in your line then you could go around and pick up items that have been misplaced and put them in the correct place. Or you could stock the shelves or bags. Most of the people you would come into contact with were nice and easy to deal with but then you have some that are having a bad day and decide to take it out on you .,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Logan, WV",10/21/15,2015,10,21

Fun customer service filled workplace,"At Walmart, a typical day was serving excellent customer service. I learned how to help individuals to the best of my ability, and if I could not help them personally I could send them to someone that could.

Terribly Managed,"A typical day working there was basically being thrown in multiple directions, even as a Department Manager, and not knowing where you would be from 1 day to the next, and constantly being scolded by managers for doing what they told you to and not what you were supposed to do (either way, they would've scolded you, either for doing your job and ignoring them, or listening to them but not getting your job done)._x000D__x000D_Most of the co-workers were great, with a few exceptions who did little to nothing and were never punished due to having outside contact with some of the managers there, or by simply being related to a friend of a manager._x000D__x000D_The management at the store I was at was downright terrible. They never would take responsibility for their actions/directions, but instead would hold you accountable for following their directions if you never got your actual job done (which was nearly impossible due to being pulled away from your duties for almost the entire day). They would constantly belittle the associates on the sales floor in front of customers, which some would see as embarrassing, not just for the associates, but also for the customers that had to witness it._x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job was actually being able to do your job, with the fact that you were constantly pulled in other directions to do other peoples jobs.

I learned how to handle people from different walks of life and religions. It opened me up to the world itself by showing me that people don't think how I would think. It also taught me that if the wrong person is given the position to be in power, they will not know how to lead the people they are responsible for.

Only as a Last Option,"Moved to a new town so I had to find a job fast to rake in some money. I was hired at the local Walmart as a part time cashier. I wasn't aware it was part time until they interviewed me. The interview took awhile. You interview with two different people. They ask you the normal long annoying questions but don't write anything down. They take you into the personnel room to interview, with employees coming and going so the whole interview process is very unprofessional and uncomfortable. After I had the two interviews they sent me home and said we will call you. Got the call the next day and they wanted me to come in for the job offer with the co manager. She told me about the pay (horrible pay, only $9.40 an hour), and gave me the drug test paperwork. You have to buy a blue or white polo, they don't provide uniforms, they only give you a name tag and a really hot vest that's uncomfortable. Orientation and your CBLs (computer based learning) take about a week then you get sent to shadow. If you're good they will just throw you out there and have you start cashiering. It's easy for sure, it just takes some getting use to when a customer with WIC or something comes. You'll be an expert after a week on your own. I have been there for 5 months, got bumped up to full time, and I absolutely hate it. Being a cashier is so tedious and boring. Grab, scan, bag. Grab, scan, bag. ALL DAY, for LITTLE PAY! It will get incredibly busy and there will be like 4 lanes open with 50 people in line. They call a code 20 (for register trained workers to come help) but half the time they don't. I wanted - more...",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Placerville, CA",10/16/15,2015,10,16

The management was good at times, the only thing was when the big bosses came in, they would freak out. The co-workers was one of the best parts of the job, we helped each other when ever we needed it, we had fun working together.

Walmart,"Well I started out moving to the area and immediately got a job with my local Walmart. Everything was fine and I was told I would be stocking lawn and garden overnight. I was trained in lawn and garden for a week, then I came in for my first real overnight shift and was told overnight lawn and garden doesn't exist. Well that was ok with me. I was constantly moved around the store which was weird to other employees that I didn't have a home isle to stock every night. I was ok with that as well. Then I was moved to the mod team with no explanation why and I trained there for a week (which I didn't get paid their salary as well) and was taken off for no reason. Then I was moved to putting things up in the steel and taken off again for no reason at all. All of this is somewhat annoying to me, but I can manage with it._x000D__x000D_The thing that really got to me was that I was hired for part time work and they were working me 40+ hours a week for the first 5 weeks maybe until I finally said something. They reduced me to 32 which would still end up at about 36 and up because you can never get out on time being overnight stock. They expect me to get my isles done and help others until 6:30am and then try to zone my isles which is impossible. I never really got any help from other associates. I had 10 pallets one night and didn't get help until 5am and they wondered why I didn't get done at 7am._x000D__x000D_I did like the other associates, but management seem to be the problem at this store with a 70 something percent turnover rate.

Productive and Consistently Learning New Things!,"I can honestly say Walmart is a pretty great place to work. If your not the desk job type, and love to learn new things everyday, this is the place for you. I was employed for Walmart for 2 years and I have learned every department in that store and its duties, except for a few things in the backroom._x000D__x000D_The only downfall is the pay. I say this for two reasons. First off, I started off as a cashier and two months later worked my way up to Customer Service. After 3 months of working customer service and learning that process I began to learn Site to Store, Electronics, Hardware, Fabric, Grocery, and the duties of a supervisor. All in which make more money than I do. After intaking knowledge and learning those responsibilites, I was placed and working in every department but my own but with a lower pay grade._x000D__x000D_Second, your pay raise and benefits are only offered once you've hit a full year of employment. Your pay raise is NOT a set amount. Your department manager decides on whether you deserve a .10 cent raise or anywhere up to .50 cents._x000D__x000D_I must say I am very thankful being able to learn so much from one company though because I am now qualified and considered for more than Fast Food Services and Cashiering positions in my future.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Surprise, AZ",10/12/15,2015,10,12
Not a good company to work for.,"Wal-Mart was the worst job I had. I didn't know who my boss or the store manager was until about 2 months after working there. A typical day at Wal-Mart its very boring and draining. Managers expect so much from you but dont teach you how to do it and they are very rude if you ask for help. I learned how to do the cash registers very well and became an customer service manager so i could run the whole front end, but i still even then didnt feel comfortable being there.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service manager ,"Central Square, NY",10/12/15,2015,10,12

Walmart is just overall a horrible expeirence,"A typical day of work summarizes into these three words; Stressful, Frustrating, and Unprofessional. I cannot begin to express the level of disrespect that you encounter from management and co workers alike, the misdirection and failure that comes from upper levels of management, or the lack of teamwork that is exercised in this culture. From your first time of training until the later, you are already put in high stress situations, and without a thought you have to react and go. Perfect for fast learning and motivation to be better than you was the previous day, but the headaches that come with it are sometimes unbearable. Wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who doesn't have tough skin, used to professionalism, or cannot adopt quick, I do not recommend this job at all.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Long Beach, CA",10/12/15,2015,10,12

I learned that you have to have knowledge in other departments as well (i.e. where certain items are found). Management is decent; I'm not going to sit here and pretend that it's top notch. The hardest part of the job is getting a second job. Walmart will NOT work around your work schedule. And if you adjust your availability, you won't be scheduled many shifts. What they tell me is that the reason is because there won't be any shifts available, when in actuality it's their way of showing passive aggression for not ""putting WalMart first"". Think about it.

There were slip, trip, and pinch hazards always popping up with no solution offered to address them. People unfamiliar with the area were sent there to help out, which made things get put on wrong shelves. Egg boxes that were dropped were sometimes set aside for someone else to deal with.

Only getting worse.,"I started working at walmart as an instock associate after high school, but like many other people still trying to find something better I was there for 5+ years. While store to store may vary, my experience which started off great only worsened. The rules and procedures are constantly changing , sometimes so that the associates/ anyone under management aren't made aware. After the company restructure recently many people had left or started to, or were let go because they love to clean house and get rid of people that have been too long. They will keep you part-time with full time hours just so they can avoid giving you benefits, or you won't even get the hours, a person can't afford to live on 8-10 dollars an hour and that is after they increased the minimum. No matter how hard I work or how fast I moved it was never good enough. Management did not care what you had to say and never give you a chance to discuss things or change their mind on poor decisions. Never got a thank you for anything I did including things that were above my paygrade. Extremely stressful and favoritism is a big issue as well as a multitude of integrity and ethical issues both for people as well as health/safety",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"North East, MD",10/7/15,2015,10,7

Walmart Home Office Summary,"This company has a tendency to lack clear and decisive focus.  Their journey from silo-ed management to a collaborative environment is counter-cultural.  As a result, role clarity is muddy and confusion is king.  Many of the corporate areas lack direction, there is no justification for their roles, and layoffs occur as a result.  I am not confident that Walmart can ever overcome this problem.  It's too large and ingrained in the mindset of the associates.  The leadership lacks the managerial courage to follow through on it's promises and reign in its managerial workforce.",2,Current Employee,Sr. Manager ,Bentonville,10/5/15,2015,10,5

A typical day at Walmart was way too much expected for way too little pay.,"I would never work at Walmart again. The managers just loved strolling around the store casually pointing out what they would like to see done. They didn't even take into consideration just how much time and manpower their ""ideas"" would take. They just wanted it done in the shortest amount of time with the least amount of people and get by the cheapest they could. They were always ready to criticize, but a compliment was very rare. I think it is a disgrace that they are the number one employer in America and their employees can not only not make enough money to live on, they also can't get enough hours and they have to beg for those. Food Stamps and Welfare are Walmart's benefit package. I don't think this is what Sam Walton had in mind when he started Walmart. I think he would be shocked. I actually got fired because my manager would change my hours and not put it in the system so it would look like I was late or even missed work. I was way too trusting that he was doing the right thing. But, he was just a snot nosed brat straight out of college without a clue about how to be a manager. I could go on and on, but, you get the idea.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"New Boston, OH",10/5/15,2015,10,5

I had some coworkers who were talkative. I eliminated that by putting whoever was talking on the truck to load the conveyer belt.

Look for other jobs,"They don't treat people with disabilities with respect. They will discriminate if anyone has a disability. They don't give very great benefits. Each person will have a part-time status with a full-time schedule with out any benefits. It is like being in high school again, and the people who are in leadership as the bullies. If anyone can take the discrimination, mistreatment and their inability to appreciate their associates, within five to ten years a person can get a promotion within the company. However, if only a person doesn't receive any coaching, which is like getting written up, no meal violations and they get along with management and other associates, easier say than done, I must say.

I worked with a great team and we all made sure that the front end and even other parts of the store ran smoothly. The hardest part of my job was when you are the only css covering all breaks and lunches and being called to different parts of the store for assistance while you are still needed on the front end to take care of customers and associates up there. But the best part of my job was meeting all the new people and making connections with them as they are the reasons we all have jobs.

no appreciation from management,working at walmart in Lebanon pa was not what I expected it would be.

CAP program,"The CAP program of Walmart is to be done everyday to ensure that products are always available for the consumer. The way to do that is to first go to the area where your inventory is kept. Reverse scan the items which means that all items should be scanned to see what can be stocked to the sales floor. Stock the items to the selves, fix the shelf on hands and shelf caps. This ensures that the item will not be picked again if the item can not go out to the sales floor. Take items that can not go to shelf and rebin them. Then work the negative on hand report, which means that we get a inventory paper that tells us the negative on hands, we are to locate the items or if we don't have them register this on the hand held devise. This starts the day and is to be done with in the first half of the shift. Second half is for price changes and Mod changes.",2,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Sales Supervisor ,"North Tonawanda, NY",10/3/15,2015,10,3

Good people to work with and good benefits,"While Walmart is a very large corporation, which touts itself as being supportive of it's people, there is rarely enough staff to accomplish the tasks given, poor communication between management and staff, and little care given to the needs of the associates. _x000D__x000D_Associates are often required to work in areas for which they have not been trained or to accept work schedules which are not consistent with either the days off or hours, and do not allow for a personal life outside of Walmart and the salaries are poor. It could potentially take an associate more than 3 years of service to see a raise of a dollar over their starting wage.  Store needs always come first. _x000D__x000D_While absenteeism is an issue for any business, the Walmart Corp. requires that if you are to be out of work for more than 3 days in a row that you must go through a long and difficult process of obtaining a leave of absence.

I worked in receiving, pets garden center, grocery, cashiering, carts, and pretty much every department but the one I was hired to work in. I would have to say without question, Walmart is hands down the worst company I have worked for to date, because of the mistreatment of workers and low hourly wages.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Orange Park, FL",9/30/15,2015,9,30

Non-productive environment and not a great place to work,"Poor management and poor execution of duties.

Walmart is O.K.,"A typical day at work involves cashiering, ringing up customers, cleaning my area, and making sure that things are tidy and zoned properly. So far I've learned how to use their cash registers and many of the functions they can perform. Management is scaled based upon pay, it's not very straightforward, so trying to get anywhere seems difficult. My co-workers are generally very nice people, they tend to be easy to get along with, and most don't seem to dislike their job terribly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with boredom and tiredness, such as when you've done everything you can, and you still need to be busy, or when there's no end to the lines of people, for 2 hours straight. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning more about people and listening to their stories, as well as figuring out why they buy ingredients for cooking.",4,Current Employee,cashier ,Helena Montana,9/30/15,2015,9,30

"flexible schedule, not the most uplifting place","Working at Walmart was an easy job, but it was tedious. My training was very short and there was still a lot I didn't learn that Iwas supposed to know. Management was available, but they were often busy._x000D_  My position required me to pull along a cart of merchandise down the aisles and place them in the correct area while assisting each customer who needed assistance and making sure the aisles were clean. If there was an over stock items I had, I would be tasked with stocking it in the back - something I had very little training on. After all the carts of merchandise were taken care of, I would then be putting any return items back on the shelves._x000D_  My co-workers were simply co-workers. Not all were approachable, but they would help if you really needed it. My immediate supervisor was always off somewhere and I could rarely reach her if I needed her assistance or a customer insisted on seeing her. _x000D_  The hardest part of this job was probably the occasional lifting I would do. I'm a small person and not too strong, so lifting some of the heavier items was not easy and I would often struggle a few minutes before being able to move - something I was repeatedly told to work on and to hurry up, which I was trying to do. _x000D_  The most enjoyable would probably be the customers.

Busy Workplace,"A typical day at work would you have to clock in and begin your shift.

You then have to make sure that that entire work area, where you are assigned, is compatible for the customers to enter. Making sure that you are in a good mood to greet and handle your customers with the proper care that they are seeking. As a cashier they moved you to different locations such as customer service, greeter, or even just to make sure that the store isn't too messy. What I have learned from that job at Wal-Mart is that no matter what position that you are titled to you can always show that you have more than on skill than being behind a register. It always let you go out there and make your communication skills more advanced than what they really are. The management was pretty organized. They were always there when there was a customer dispute and they handled that situation in a professional manner and they made sure that the problem was solved. My co- workers were excellent. They helped me so much when I was a new comer. Whenever the managers were busy with a different situation, I always had the people who worked along with me to answer the questions that I had. The hardest part of my job had to be making sure that you always knew what you were doing no matter the area that you were working in.

There was not the communication between staff (Hourly) and Salaried that there should have been due to what I felt was a bias, but it could have been lack of patience and due to their ducks just not being in a row they were combative and acted defensive when challenged to correct this matter...they did not have an open door policy upon complaints or suggestions from lower totem pole employees as rookies just coming in and their dictatorship on this was less than impressive from my perspective.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bend, OR",9/29/15,2015,9,29

Great family-like place to work.,The work is pretty consistent day to day even with changes. I learned to work together with many people as Walmart has its way of developing a family-like environment among coworkers. The hardest part is adapting to change as the company frequently changes while all positions develop their own routine. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with other associates and being able to satisfy customers.

Very past paced place to work.,"Very fast paced place to work. A lot of responsibility with the job. Ask to perform a lot of duties that do not pertain to your job title. Learned about defective merchandise, inventory control and how to ship hazardous materials by Federal DOT guidelines.Had the opportunity to learn the receiving side of the job as well. Some people are easy to work with, some are not. Management does not back the associates on decisions that are made and do not look at all things involved in making decisions which I guess is part of running a large company. Hard to complete all the job responsibilities and perform the extra ones you are ask to do without extra help. Most enjoyable thing about the job was working one on one with the associates and customer and developing and ability to adapt to any situation. And being able to prove to myself that I could complete anything I was asked to do.",3,Former Employee,Claims Supervisor ,"Winston-Salem, NC",9/29/15,2015,9,29

The remainder of the day is spent assisting cashiers and customers however needed, whether its a training question or dealing with a complaint. There is usually up to 6 customer service managers  on duty and we all take part in whatever responsibilties we take over. There are different levels of management which we try not to rely on unless the situation requires a manager that supercedes our level of management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some customer situations or when its busy and we are understaffed for various reasons. The most enjoyable part is assisting the customers and or associates that are appreciative, pleasurable, and when doing a good job there is postive feedback for a job well done.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Charlotte, NC",9/28/15,2015,9,28

Wal-mart does not compensate long term associates well,"Most managers do not know their jobs and only do enough to get by. The standards have fallen considerably over the years. It is frustrating that newer associates were given substantial raises, long term loyal associates were not, and now the hours of all are being cut.

I take time to be kind and helpful to all my customers, even the ones that are somewhat afflicted and need more assistance then others. The management in our store is in uproar do to some improprieties that happened to our former manager.  I pray that this will be resolved and it makes the workers to feel not threatened by the whole picture. On a whole the job is nice and I like dealing with the public. We need to have more registers open and more people in Customer Services, and the Money Center customers ask me all the time and it puts me in a difficult situation to try to deal with.",4,Current Employee,Cashier and Sales Associate ,"Bristol, TN",9/27/15,2015,9,27

Retail is very challenging.,I worked for Walmart for 9 years as a sales associate and it was a very challenging experience. I had good health benefits and sometimes there were quarterly bonuses.

I have learned more patience for people while working at Wal-Mart since every one is different. Taking the time to triple count money back to customers. The management at Wal-Mart is amazing I could not ask for better people then they have. The management staff is broken up by Store Manger, Co-Managers, Assistant Managers, Department Managers and last but not least the the CSM the people who hold down the front of the store and keep customers very happy. The hardest part about my job is sometimes when a customer yells and curses at you for something you have no control over because it is store policy I learned that you can't make everyone happy. The most enjoyable part about my job is other associates I work with.

I've had to door greet, sweep and mop floors and wash windows. etc. I get along very well with my co-workers and enjoy their company.

Multiple working titles for walmart,When I first started working for Walmart i began as a stocker. I would go to the back room where the IMS workers would pick items that needed to be stocked. I would walk all day through out the store putting items on shelves and also assist customers with whatever they needed. after four months management moved me to overnight due to understaffed shift. while on overnight I was in charge of what most associates called the hardest job. I would stock paper and chemical items which in total accounted for six pallets of stock. A month later I was to be moved back to day stocking. Management tried to keep me on overnight because they said I was doing excellent work. When I came back to day shift I was moved to Downstocker. that job title means I was responsible for unloading the walmart truck and dividing the stock for the overnight shift.

Truly an awful place to work.,"My typical day with Walmart was spent performing not just the tasks of my own department, but several other departments as the store was (and continues to be) woefully under-staffed. The management was poor at best, often driving associates to quit or simply stop showing up for work with their lack of concern for employee wellbeing or working conditions. Furthermore, there was absolutely no communication between different managers often leading to employees being caught between two equal-level managers with different tasks or plans. My coworkers were nice and most of them were good to work with, but with new associates often quitting within a month there was a very small number of long-term professional relationships. The hardest part of working at Walmart is trying to fit several people's worth of tasks and projects into incredibly short shifts. My average shift times were 4-5 hours, but the amount of work was often that of a full 9-hour shift, and frequently punctuated by management interruptions. The most enjoyable parts of the job were helping people and getting my workspace clean. I was never happier at Walmart than when the Electronics Department was looking presentable and I had a customer to talk through about games, tablets, or computer in order to help them make their purchase.",1,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Oklahoma City, OK",9/23/15,2015,9,23

When Sam Walton was alive it was great,"I started working at Walmart when Sam Walton was still alive and the company was outstanding, It was ""The"" place to work. When Sam died things changed and not everything was for the good. For some reason it seemed the biggest change was on the management level. I don't know if the new corporate was putting extra pressures on the managers but it seemed like management got mean. They didn't care anymore that you had a family and would rather fire you if you had to leave for a family issue then to keep you on and find out what was wrong. Many associates have been fired for silly reasons all because they were full time associates and they had all the benefits. As the company has continued to grow they have cared less and less about their employees.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Suffolk, VA",9/23/15,2015,9,23

"Difficult workplace, little respect for the individual","I have worked with this company for over eight years (since I was 16). It was a great place to work - family came first, individuals were always respected, management was kind and helpful, everyone had a pleasant demeanor. The company, now, is difficult to work for. I used to be able to have time off for school and extracurricular activities (high school and college), but was told I could not have time off to work at my other part time job. It is very difficult to get time off, no matter if you have an appointment, family gathering, school event, etc. - you have to speak to several levels of management and ask other associates to take or switch shifts. There is no respect for the individual from management or customers - if a customer is disrespecting you, management does not stand up for you. There is also a lack of communication among all levels of management and to associates. Some coworkers are pleasant and make the days somewhat enjoyable. New policies and procedures are implemented almost monthly; associates who have been with the company for a number of years are seeing a cut in benefits (I lost my health insurance because I did not average 29.9 hours per week while I was going to college), cut/change in pay raises, little to no flexibility for work availability.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"De Pere, WI",9/22/15,2015,9,22

"Depressing place to work, only job in town.","Worked six years in two departments. Never produced what they think you should. No matter how fast you work they expect more production. A manager once said ""quantity not quality"". They promote people who should not be given power over other people. You can be over qualified for many positions. People are put in positions they have no knowledge of or experience. Promotion by who you know not what you know. Some managers will go after you for no reason and harass you. Many of the managers were very nice and helpful but did not last long. Most employees would quit but have no other place to go. The store is run by Arkansas managers. Micro managed to the max.

A great place to work if you're a social person,"I'm a rather shy person so working as a cashier and a sales floor associate was somewhat mind blowing. If you're not good with counting money or helping out people then this is not a job for you. Even though I am a rather shy person, Walmart helped me open up to people. The management is 50/50. Most of the time, management only cared about their list they had to check off before they could go home. So if they assigned you a job, they expected you to drop whatever you were doing and finish that assignment before you could complete stocking the shelves or whatever you were doing. The part-time workers and the seasonal workers are the hardest working people at Walmart. The full-time workers know they will always have 40 hours no matter what and so they somewhat slacked on their work ethics or treating customers with respect. Many customers complained about the long lines but when you have so many people working that shift, the managers can't do much. Overall my experience at Walmart was pretty amazing!

Don't have too many expectations,"I primarily stocked so I always started off in the back of the store. I would either work on my own or with another person, breaking down pallets or organizing items onto a crate to stock at a later time. Management was nice but always seemed to be locked up in their office, and managers were always being relocated so there isn't really any interaction between them and their employees. For the most part everyone works on their own or in groups of two or three; you can finish your tasks quickly but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise you will be left looking around for work. Don't bother socializing with your coworkers, managers would prefer you to be doing your task on your own, unless it calls for the help of another. Hardest part of the job was trying to be active. I was able to work around the store and keep busy, but there is only so much you can do working at a Neighborhood Walmart.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Farmers Branch, TX",9/19/15,2015,9,19

Nepotism,"Never before had I experienced such a volatile work environment. Frequently one may be praised by one supervisor for how one does something, and scolded by another for that same thing.

Run for the hills,"If you haven't been working at this place for over ten years already then it's a terrible place to work. The seniority puts you in a good place for vacations and extra/more pay which makes it seem like being a punching bag is worth it. An assistant mgr literally asked me ""What are you good for?"" Who wants to work for someone that talks to you like that. The managers keep you in the dark about everything, so employees are never on track with what's going on in the company. Heck I had to hear about the new walmart raises through the news..Not my manager. Lastly, managers will pull you from your department and put you somewhere you know nothing about, and expect that work to be done plus your department work to be done in the little 4-5 hours they give you because they cut hours all the time.

I learned to work at a fast pace but still be accurate at what I needed to accomplish. Management helped me succeed at moving up in the work place, not as a full time manager, but to help out fellow management and get my experience in to move up when the position came available.

"productive but slave driving, overworked and overwhelmed","Typically we are the ones that are in charge of restocking shelves for the next day and our night moves quickly. We put out the most freight between all shifts and must take breaks and lunches in a timely manner. We are expected to have our hands in our work without looking around much but speaking to our customers and smiling even though we are generally exhausted because of our schedule of over nights we manage all tasks. We are overworked because we work in a skeleton crew with no new hires in our future and are usually in charge of more that 1 person should have to handle. If we are behind our boss will scream and yell or write us up.      _x000D_     There is no time for stealing time by being on the computers to check schedules or for job transfers or qualifications checks or we are blackmailed for stealing time on work hours. These things are done on our 15 minute breaks. The break room has no ac or heat, bugs really bad in the break areas and in the warehouse where employees have their foods._x000D_  Employee moral is down because of write ups for compliance because the human body only works so fast. There are cookouts and pizza nights for those not getting hurt at work or customers not getting hurt. A health fair occasionally and reviews for job performances which raises are given but are on a percentage depending on our compliance which is always rated lowest to save the company money. A quarter bonus is given for employees being there over 6 months depending on hours so hours are cut so the company saves money again depending on hours worked depends on the bonus for each employee. - more...",3,Current Employee,Overnight GM stocker ,"Warner Robins, GA",9/17/15,2015,9,17

It's like working with a bunch of high school students. If you do your work, get along with everyone and just do enough to get by, then no one will bother you.

Wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you enjoy being stepped on and enjoy constant disappointments and inconsistency.

Those problems could be anywhere from not getting vacations approved or days off to having several managers telling you to do different things and not being able to tell them no, I have other things to do due to the threat of a coaching. Walmart as a whole is usually understaffed, usually due to low pay in the area. They are improving, but they have a long way to go and the way they structure and prioritize things needs to change into a more friendly environment if they want to keep a good associate turnover every year.

If you want to advance in the company prepare to become personal friends with management. On Facebook. In real life. Know their wives' and their kids' names. If you're not on friendly terms with the management, prepare to get the worst hours and the worst treatment. Their managers are often times pedantic and prone to absolute nepotism. I've never seen such a vast company have such an ill prepared management team in my life.

a day in the life...,"Each morning I go into my department and do a quick walk through and note areas of need. I then stock freight and bin the overstock.

"A pretty good job overall, with chances for advancement","I worked for Walmart for about 8.5 years.  I started as an overnight stocker and after a couple of promotions, I became an assistant manager.  I liked many aspects of the job including being able to interact with customers and employees.  I also liked selling a lot of product during the day and being able to come in at night and basically rebuild everything.  Sometimes on extremely busy days the shelves would be quite empty and we would be able to put out enormous amounts of product, which would free up space in the backrooms, make our store look better, and make us ready for the next business day.  _x000D__x000D_I learned a lot about merchandising, managing people and interacting with customers.  The hardest part of the job was also probably the most rewarding, which was coming in to manage an overnight shift when the shelves were pretty much empty from the day before, and being able to fill the shelves and features and generally make large amounts of merchandise ""go away,"" while also making a lot of product available for the day's business.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Ardmore, OK",9/13/15,2015,9,13

"Overworked, Underpaid","I think it's kind of ridiculous that people think that people who work minimum wage jobs don't deserve any more money. If you've ever worked a minimum-wage job you'd probably say it's one of the hardest jobs you'd ever had either because of the monotony or physical labor.  However, at Wal-Mart it gets worse as you climb the ladder.  As a customer service manager, I made only $.90/hour more than I did as a cashier.  _x000D__x000D_A typical day at Wal-Mart included coming in and jumping in immediately into the frenzy of simultaneously placing front-end employees, answering requests from management, addressing customer complaints, price checks, going to other areas of the store and having to literally beg them to come cashier if it was busy (because you aren't their manager), register audits, trying to fix faulty front-end equipment, going to other areas of the store when they were having register issues, and filling in for people greeters, cart pushers, service desk associates, and cashiers as needed.  _x000D__x000D_I did learn a lot, that's for sure, but unfortunately not a lot translates to the outside world. It doesn't do me any good knowing how to fix an ATM now. I'm grateful that it gave me management experience, however, it was in such a way that you're never allowed to really do the managing.  They let you play manager, but make you work like a dog._x000D__x000D_Management was inconsistent and cold. There was always a big disconnect between upper management and everyone else-only making themselves visible when there was a problem and never getting any positive feedback.

The Pay Could Have Been Better and Managers More Understanding,I was pleased to gain employment with Wal-Mart but was dealing with a lot of personal issues.

chaos,"The job itself wasn't bad. It was a manageable workload. But in my opinion there is WAY too much management in that store. 5 different managers would tell you 5 different things to do and because of being short staffed you were also expected to cover the unfilled jobs. It was complete and total chaos most of the time and I would not, for any amount of money, EVER go back.

I learned quite a bit about time management and prioritizing. The management was for the most part very helpful and I connected with several especially my assistant manager who helped me a great deal. Most of my co workers were younger people so it was harder at times to get them to take the job as seriously as I did but they were all hard workers. The hardest part of the job was finding balance in order to achieve all of the daily tasks especially given that electronics associates are the first to be pulled to cover other areas, so we had to often adjust for their loss at the last minute.

Very productive and fun plae to work,"Management was more than helpful with me when I was having a hard time finding a place to stay. I made a lot of friends and they were very helpful. I learned a lot more than I expected and I would love to go back and learn more. The most enjoyable part of my day is the challenge we get at the beginning of the shift. For example, We have a briefing of how much freight came in on the trucks and how much we need to get onto the floor and out of the back room, so each person is assigned to a department and you get everything that came on that certain truck. I was always in the Cosmetics and HBA department and HBA always was second on having the most freight each night. So I enjoyed making up a plan of how much stuff I would be able to get on the floor before 5 a.m. And 99% I always got everything done before everyone who had a lot less freight than me. I saw it to be a fun challenge every night instead of a pain.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Sebastian, FL",9/11/15,2015,9,11
Repetitive work,"I pushed carts for hours at a time and got a small lunch break every day. I really didn't learn anything from this job.

I did learn a lot from the company in the aspects of: costumer service and knowledge on meats as well as produce. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the management team, I loved my job and how I was able to help people. My co-workers in my department didn't share the same drive and the determination that I did to get the job done and keep the store clean. All and all, I had a lot of passion and respect for my job,I just wish that my store shared it.

Productive,The over all workplace was a quite place with beneficial co-worker interaction. The manager had it in their heads that the things they told us to do were like orders. I'm not an animal that is to be threatened of a job loss because of the incompetence of my seniors.

"Many hats, little time","In the past year or so, Wal-mart has pushed for a more clinical setting in the work place, which involves many more job duties to perform, such as MTMs and immunizations, and increasingly more management duties to perform, which end up being on our own time, while at the same time decreasing our staff hours.  Somehow it all gets done, and my satisfaction still comes from taking care of our customers.  I have learned how to manage over the years, do coachings, watch the budget, encourage my staff, do MTMs and IMZs, job interviews, keep track of and direct the OTC department, do scheduling, etc.  The hardest part of the job is trying to help a customer and failing.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the satisfaction of helping a customer, in whatever way that might be.",3,Current Employee,Pharmacy Manager ,"Baraboo, WI",9/10/15,2015,9,10
Management doesn't care about employees,Walmart is not a good company to work for.  The company only cares about its bottom line.  To make profit it will cut employee hours and tell you that you cannot work any overtime.  The company doesn't care about its customers as you can tell by the long lines at the registers.  There aren't enough cashiers to keep the lines moving.  There is very little advancement at Walmart.  The pay raises instituted this year have led to disgruntled employees and less time to work than before.  For someone making $9 they cannot afford to provide for their family and pay for the benefits that the company offers its full time employees.  I don't recommend that anyone work for Walmart unless there is no other choice.,1,Former Employee,Department Manager/Customer Service ,"Columbia, MO",9/10/15,2015,9,10

Somedays i can scream,Ive been with them for 2.5 years.  I do not get weekends off because im not one of the special people in our dept.  I do have kids and only get to see them fully on the weekends ive requested time off denied I have requested a change of availability but that means you do not want to work to them so they cut your hours Ive not found out yet if I got that change or not.  Communication wise is so poor they tell you they need to change your schedule the day before so you have no time to prepare your kids.  Over all management seems to treat you like a child with no appreciation.  Customers at my store have to wait on the next available associate to wait on them because our store is so poorly staffed.  We have to cross train in every dept.  that way their is to be coverage 1 person to 6 depts. so funny .

Strange,"working at Walmart was fine. the breaks were spaces evenly, the coworkers were tolerable, the management was helpful.",4,Former Employee,truck unloader ,"Harrisville, Ut",9/9/15,2015,9,9
A very entitled work place that allowed for no room to breathe.,"When I would get to work I would punch in and immediately i would start up in doing what I needed to do. it was a fast paced environment with a quota of how many picks we were supposed to get individually within the span of our first four hours of work. So i personally rushed around and tried to make at least 50 over my quota every single day. Walmart was not one that very well rewarded such effort, instead often ignoring their employees and slacking off in the office talking about events from the weekend, While if we were caught doing such a thing it might cause for us to be reprimanded. When asking managers for help they often put it off, and sometimes you would be waiting days to hear back from them. Then they would wonder why employees were angry because they could not get approved of time off or otherwise, due to the managers having not followed up as they should have. I would say the hardest part of the job was sometimes staying motivated to keep working because of lack of incentive, and the nearly 0 tolerance policy for missing work. You were allowed three days that you could miss work, and after that if you missed you began what they called the coaching process. I had many medical issues including and not limited to trying to take care of my teeth. Many know that trying to do anything with a horrible tooth ache is close to impossible, but Walmart did not care about that and instead would not work with me when work had to be missed, whether for emergency room visits or planned appointments. I presented documentation from the emergency room doctors and still they refused - more...",4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Freeport, IL",9/9/15,2015,9,9

The hardest part of being Pharmacy Technician is not being able to meet the customers satisfaction. Some days, we tried our best to expedite the medications but due to medical concerns or drug interactions, we aren't able to process the medications and the patients gets upset. No matter way, we can each and everyone of our patients to leave happy and know that we cared enough to take the extra precaution of dispensing the correct medications. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the recognition for meeting our patient's expectations. Rather than see our patient as just a ""customer"", we develop a relationship with some of them. It put a smile of some faces when we greet them by their name, ask how their day is going, and have small talk with them.

Great place to work at,A great place to work at with supportive management. I learned how to be able to cook better and check temperature and everything on the food and how to store food in the freezer. Some of my co-workers were alright but some didn't want to help each other out when they were in need of assistance with the customers. The hardest part of the job was when I had to cut meat and cheese and cook and serve the customers all at once by myself without any help and if I needed help some of my co-workers weren't there to assist me. I enjoyed working with the managers and some of my co-workers and it was a face paced environment.,5,Current Employee,Customer Service/Deli ,"emporia, va",9/8/15,2015,9,8

Busy workplace that is always changing,"A big company with changes happening all the time. Very diverse employee field and very different every day.

Customer Service Manager,"As a customer service manager, I come in on time. I sign my keys out, I check on all my cashiers that are their,I walk the front end to see the condition that it is in. Myself and another cashier do what is necessary to make sure the front end is taken care of and straightened up. I check with other CSM's to determine tasks and see who is going to do what. I like working with my co-workers because I like teamwork. And teamwork always makes everything easier. The hardest part of my job was when I didn't have enough cashiers and customers were backed up. But even then I get a register and get a cash drawer just like the cashiers and help out.

Productive but it is all about who you know,I normal busy day had csm's and coworkers running. I had to deal with an extremely slow worker most days and it really put a strain on some of us at times. Other times coworkers were late or lazy. Most people were not at the job station they were suppose to be due to lack of supervisors up front. I loved my job and loved the people I got to meet. We had to deal with thieves on a regular basis though and usually they were given what they wanted because supervisors and managers only want to please a customer making employees look stupid for backing up the rules.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Rep ,"Phenix City, AL",9/7/15,2015,9,7
Remodeling Stores around New England.,Working at Walmart was a fun and rewarding job. I enjoyed my almost 5 years with the company. Yes it is like every company it has its ups and downs. However on my part there seemed to be more ups then downs. I worked my way from a Sales Associate in 2010 to a Home Office Field Project Supervisor in 2014. Not many companies allow you to promote so fast. With great work ethics you can go very far in the company. Unfortunately certain circumstances happened and I no longer work there. The people I have met in the many store I did work in are still very close to me today. On a typical day at Walmart for me was always fun and fast past. Another name for my Job Title is Culture Warrior. We step it up get the work done in a timely manner but have fun doing it. Of course some days are more stressful then others but that just means its time to buckle down and really get to it. Not Just give your average 110% but step it up to 120% or 150% etc. If you take pride in your work it truly shows and that was always our goal in store planning. To show associates that hard work does pay off and you can have fun while doing it. I believe as a manager if your associates are happy you get great work results.,5,Former Employee,Store Planning Field Project Supervisor ,"Gardner, MA",9/7/15,2015,9,7

Overall fun place to work,"Walmart is a great place to work if you are looking for a job on the side or if you are in high school and need a small income. The work environment is fun, you meet a lot of interesting people and work with very nice people. It is some what hard to balance your work life and home life together, especially if you are working evenings while your family is working during the day, it's hard to have some family time. They do give paid 15 minute breaks in the middle of your shift r every 2 hours. Otherwise I love it!",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Manitowoc, WI",9/7/15,2015,9,7
sales associate,"A typical work day was full of helping customers find product they needed, answering any questions they had. Stocking the department, learning the new product so if and when a customer needed it or had questions I could be as knowledgeable as possible. My co-workers and I worked on things projects together at times when it was needed. The hardest part of the days where when my co-workers or myself were pulled away from the department to go to other departments, I felt then that our department was left without the attention it needed. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping customers with anything they needed help with, being a question or finding the perfect item they needed.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Quinlan, TX",9/7/15,2015,9,7

Family oriented,"Family friendly and looking forward to new adventures. My only problem with my job was that I lived 30 miles away and was  being scheduled for 4 hour shifts 2 or three times a week.  I requested to be scheduled for 8 hours or not at all and that request was not granted.  I even went to Stacy with my issue and she said she would take care of it, but it didn't happen.  Certainly no disrespect to her, but I couldn't continue to work for nothing the way gas prices were at that time.  However, I now live in Kimberling City which is only 5 miles from Branson West so the 4 hour shift would not be a problem.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Branson West, MO",9/7/15,2015,9,7
fun work place but contradictory,I had a lot of fun getting to know the workers there and working with them but management didn't seem to talk very often to each other. Often one manager would tell you to do one thing then another manager would tell you to do something else and then one of the two things wouldn't get done.,3,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Clinton, IA",9/7/15,2015,9,7
A good job for high school students,"Not a good job if you have any trouble picking up and learning the job on your own.

Ok place to work if you can handle the stress,Now that Walmart is going back to basics the beginning of the day starts out with sorting through the leftovers of what third shift wasn't able to complete and figure out what to do with the merchandise.

Terrible job with descent pay,"I would not reccomend anyone to work at Walmart where I am currently employed. The Management team does not support its workers and some are treated better than others because of Favoritism. They do not care for those who are struggling to make a living everyday like myself. They are cutting hours and making it difficult for associates to live off of the little money we make. At my store, unless you pretty much become someone who ""sucks up"" to the managers, you will not have the opportunity to move up in the company. It's a dead-end job that requires too much work and not enough pay. Only the Dpt. Managers and New Hires will recieve the so-called raise the company talks about, leaving the other workers who have been working here longer with no raise at all.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Mays Landing, NJ",9/7/15,2015,9,7

Very productive workforce.,"I would come in and clock in, go to my bay and take my pallet jack and L cart to the floor.

Non supportive actions of management,It appears to be a non supportive atmosphere when it comes to the management at Wal-Mart. They speak and treat  the workers in a non professional manner. The management appears to have a lack of communication and a huge showing of not being proactive when it comes to the workers. I think the CEO needs to know what goes on at Wal-Mart because I am sure this is not the concept of what Wal-Mart wants represented. From my experience Wal-Mart shows to be a hostile work environment.,1,Former Employee,Backroom Inventory Associate ,"Jakson, TN.",9/7/15,2015,9,7

Good job for college students,"Management is horrible & ungreatful!!! If you are full-time your hours can drop from 40 to 16 hours a week!! They don't schedule enough people to work, so they run the little bit of associates that they do schedule, crazy! It's a lot of the buddy system that flows through walmart as well. Even if you are well qualified for a position it doesn't matter, it's the friends that you have in different management positions. Save your time and hair, and look for something better._x000D_Walmart is too stressful!!!",1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Savannah, Ga",9/6/15,2015,9,6
Busy enviroment and great enviroment,Days went by fast with the hilarious customers. I learned how to work at a fast pace. Management were tough and didn't let anything get passed them. My co-workers did their job as expected. The hardest would have to be the long lines which causes the customers to get upset.

Management was ok some was very understanding and some was not.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Junction City, KS",9/5/15,2015,9,5

Opportunities of advancment available but limited to your status,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with others who make a difference in others daily lives and make it fun at the same time. You learn about yourself and how much of a difference you also make in others daily lives. The hardest part of the job is realizing that the bottom line seems to be more important than the customers or the associates. All associates seem to have different importance to  management. (Favoritism and prejudice according to how well they like/tolerate you)  As well as, the lack of communication from management to staff and proper training._x000D_A typical day includes a system you should be working, embellished with micromanaging from several, not one, management and being expected to do these tasks and your agenda that is expected._x000D_You feel you are working for management and not the customer._x000D_Management indicates open door policy for difficulties you may be having; however, once it is spoken about, all others know it within the hour and if it were directed towards management then you have just painted a target on yourself for retaliation, and that will be the last time you feel comfortable using the open door policy.",2,Former Employee,backroom lead/supervisor ,"Eastland, TX",9/5/15,2015,9,5
Not as bad as people think,"A typical day at walmart depends on your shift. 1st shift is by far the easiest. 2nd shift is busy and lines can be long. But it's easy work. Most people aren't inclined to have a conversation, but you get a couple regulars and they will look for you. Those days are much better._x000D__x000D_Most of what you learn is store policy and procedures. PLUs and so forth. Applying for management positions is as hit or miss as applying to walmart. All that corporate garbage gets in the way of hiring actually qualified people from within your own store. After the one year lock, I was recommended by the other CSMs to apply for a new vacancy. Yet I failed the corporate test only to later be told that they could've let me cheat a little by having someone sit with me. Because even management knew that the test was arbitrary. I had done a good job and performed, IMO, in the top 10. I did become a back up supervisor, but there was no pay incentive. It was just for experience._x000D__x000D_Besides that, if your store is set up for it, you can get quarterly bonuses. They vary based on avg hrs worked and quality of the store in various aspects. An average I got for working about 25 hrs a week was about 100-150 per quarter.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"DeKalb, IL",9/5/15,2015,9,5
by having a good attitude and friendly personality you can do amazing.,"I start the day with many different tasks for many managers, while i provide fast, friendly, good customer service. I learned how to manage my time to get thinks done while cashiering and assist customers with what they need. the management members are a little unorganized there's a lack of communication which make the job harder, but by me using logic sense, I got to manage important things getting done, the first priority is customers satisfaction and good shopping experiences, then of course there safety and the fellow associate safety, plus the team work. the hardest part of the job is not having the equipment to get the job done but it doesn't stop me from getting my job done perfectly. the most enjoyable part is putting a smile on a customer and hoping that will make their day go better.",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Santee, CA",9/5/15,2015,9,5

I loved working for this company but I couldn't balance my life around it,"It was a wonderful company to work for. I was introduced to a lot of aspects of the company.

enjoyable work environment,"Coming into work I started my night by going to the office and have a team meeting about our assignments. After we were assigned to our jobs we got straight to what was needed to be done, every night was different for me. I learned how to stock in every department of the store from the freezers to the dry groceries and so on. Management was helpful with learning each of the departments in the store and also making sure our assignments were finished on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was looking at all hard work that was accomplished by the end of the night. As for the hardest part it would have to be getting the assignments completed with the team short handed on busy nights.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Oceanside, CA",9/5/15,2015,9,5

My typical day at Walmart,"Arrive at 1:00 p.m. work until 10:00 p.m. How to be tolerable of other people and their issues. Management at Walmart is insufferable, most of the CSM's are a great group of people and some of the managers are okay as well, but their are a few of the managers that feel that they are better than everyone else.  My co-workers are a group of wonderful people who are like me and just trying to make ends meet. The hardest part of my job is standing on my feet for 8 hours a day and only being able to sit down when I go on breaks. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I get off work.",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Minot, ND",9/4/15,2015,9,4

My job that I hold is very crucial for the frontend checkout as well as to my cashiers that I am over. I have learned a great deal from Walmart, as such I have also held many positions in Walmart. the hardest part of my job is the work flow is very unpredictable. we try to map out what kind of day we are going to have how many customers come and shop at our store, but that is something that is very hard to do. the most enjoyable part of my day is when I get to see returning customers who stop by and ask how my family is or what kind of day I am having.",5,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,lake charles louisiana,9/4/15,2015,9,4
