Negligence of the Coaches and Team leads ,They base it all off how long you've been there and ignore any input from new hires. My team lead is a bad person and they don't listen to me about it,2,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Somersworth, NH",1/4/23,2023,1,4
NOthing is good ,There are no true benefits to working for walmart except that they might have a good dental plan at the moment. But they will probably more than likely take that away if they had the opportunity! ,1,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Spanish Fork, UT",1/4/23,2023,1,4

"Regional Store, Look Out!",In general Walmart stores have slowly begun going down hill with how managers are treated and how certain managers treat their subordinates. Bainbridge however is a different animal. You’ve got about 12 different “bosses” and then look out for the email at 5pm on a Friday that the corporate jet is headed this way…They genuinely used to care about their people and it’s really all about the money anymore. ,3,Former Employee,Co-Manager/Store Manager ,"Bainbridge, OH",1/4/23,2023,1,4

3 stars,"What is the best part of working at the company?The people I worked with made my time with the company enjoyable. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?When management gives you multiple tasks to complete within a certain time, on top of helping other associates pick up their slack. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great if you have management that is willing to put in the work to get tasks done and lead by example instead if barking orders and micromanaging every aspect of what where doing.

2 stars,"What is the best part of working at the company?The best part about working at Walmart was the availability to work in a plethora of different departments.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?In my experience, my location was severely understaffed making my coworkers and I cover sections of the department that weren't our responsibility (ie. fitting room, returns, etc.) Furthermore, the customer interactions were stressful specifically when they're agitated due to lack of staffing.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The diversity is nice, however in my specific location there were certain situations where discrimination existed toward people of color + those who aren't fluent in english.What is a typical day like for you at the company?A typical day for me in my department is to do 4-5 rolling racks, zone the entire department, and help cover my coworkers areas when they aren't there.",2,Current Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Salem, NH",1/4/23,2023,1,4
It's a job,I can only speak on my experience in the front end. There's lots of young people (under 21). Management is a joke. Lots of disgusting and ghetto customers. Their points system for attendance is unreasonable. You get a 10% associate discount card after the probationary period. Little to no other useful benefits. This is not a career.,1,Former Employee,Front End Checkout Team Associate ,"Irvine, CA",1/4/23,2023,1,4

"Job Was Amazing, Helped To Reduce Anxiety.","As a stocker at Walmart, I learned many skills that will help me through other businesses, such as learning to use a forklift, learning how to work (this was my first job), and learning how to work with people better. Before coming to Walmart I had very bad social anxiety, after a few months of working at Walmart, I can say I feel much more comfortable talking with people than I did before getting the job. This job is great for someone looking for a relaxed side job, or for someone who has never worked before and really doesn't know where to start.",4,Former Employee,Stocking Associate ,Pennsylvania,1/4/23,2023,1,4

Not Too Stressful/Horrible Managers,"Usually had a good time at work aside form the occassional angry customer, but that is to be expected. It helps to understand your abilities and know who to ask when confused. My only real issue was the managers. My team leads were fantastic, but my Coaches and HR never did their job and lacked integrity. I personally informed management of a week I would be out of town. I was repeatedly told over and over that I was allowed to take time off and that the system would take time to update. Ultimately, the system bever changed and I was given points for no-call no-show. I received many points and risked being fired. I talked to the HR about the issue and my Coach, but was denied any solution. I quit shortly after.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Conway, AR",1/4/23,2023,1,4

"Easy work, management needs to step up","I worked at a Neighborhood Market Walmart. For the most part, the job was easy and I got used to walking a lot fast. It wasn’t all that difficult to reach your numbers but it did get tedious when you would constantly need to find your managers to ask for missing items. The managers were experienced but were always tired and honestly didn’t seem like they cared. I heard many times “You’ve been here for a month already, you should know where everything in the store is”. My initial training for the position lasted 30 minutes and me and the other new hires did not get a tour of the store. The environment was very similar to high school, obvious favoritism and hierarchies. Even if you literally talk to nobody, your coworkers will find a way to make up something about you. It’s Walmart, did you expect much?",2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"San Diego, CA",1/4/23,2023,1,4

"Alright job, bad superiors","Honestly the job itself wasn't too bad. Most of the time I could just put an earbud in and work at my own pace. The big problems were the weather and bosses. You're expected to do the same amount of work no matter how cold, hot or how hard it's raining. The bosses were also really annoying and they set super unrealistic expectations like not being able to wear hoodies even though it was 30 degrees outside where I was working and we had to find our team leader every time we wanted to take a break and confirm it with all my teammates. The coaches and team leaders were very obnoxious and grumpy all the time and really I felt like there entire job was to yell at you if you stopped working for 30 seconds to catch a breather.",3,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Warsaw, IN",1/4/23,2023,1,4
Backbreaking Work at times,I'll be completely honest and say that we are still quite underpaid for all the hard work we do. And Management will just put any moron they can find to be the TL. It's mostly the younger workers who are always distracted that make it hard but I'll be honest when I say the older folks are at fault as well when. They say it will kill then to do too much smh.,2,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Pampa, TX",1/4/23,2023,1,4

Some leads are nicer than others. They do make you work sick however, flu and/or covid.",3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Brenham, TX",1/4/23,2023,1,4
"Better pay than most, Long hours and Favoritism","Walmart offers good benefits and $13-14/hr base pay depending on what shift you work. The work itself is not hard but expect that you will always on your feet and that the hours will be long, especially if you work overnight. Some of Management is good, but not the majority. Many members of Management have bad attitudes, take more than their fair share of Coffee/smoke breaks, and there is a lot of favoritism at play across all shifts. Also expect that as a group you will almost always be told you're not doing enough and that different Shifts/Departments will usually be pin against each other in a blame game of who did what. There are also a lot of workers who are only there because they have been there 5-10 years and won't be corrected or fired despite working slow or just not ever following protocol. If you are a quick and hard worker, you will most likely get close to management but also most members of management will most likely abuse that and will throw you under the bus the moment you burn out. Management also loves to tell good workers that they will promote them to get them to do more for them when the chance is actually very slim and based more on if they like you more than xyz or not.Training is partly on a computer and partly tossed in with a buddy for anywhere from a day or two to a week if your lucky and then figure the rest of it out on your own. All that considered it is still one of better jobs to have around the area.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocking Associate ,"Live Oak, FL",1/4/23,2023,1,4
They don't care much for their associates ,"I don't really have anything positive to say about this company.   My present store doesn't help me with my schedule due to short staffed.

It's like any retail store job,"In my experience, if you do your job well there's plenty of opportunity to grow. Is it a job I see myself growing into? Not really, as I matured I started valuing family time and a set schedule. They do not give you ANY holiday off, especially if you are a supervisor or higher. They never approved a whole week of vacation but that was in OGP. Overall, I think it's ok, but I recommend it for younger people. ",3,Former Employee,Supervisor ,"Gibsonton, FL",1/4/23,2023,1,4

There are plenty of opportunities for advancement.,"Personally, I loved my time working at Walmart. I enjoyed where I worked and felt welcomed by my fellow associates. Unfortunately, however, our store was just extremely understaffed and management was not the best, which made it no better. There would often times be team leads and regular associates that had to try to run the store because management was lazy and would often leave early. The store also usually had no AP and was extremely unorganized.

It really depends on the management team,"When I started there there were managers that acknowledged the hard work of the associates and I had a good time working there, but slowly they were either let go or replaced with managers that were more concerned with their image to corporate and less about the associates under them, and became a place of favoritism. Many good associates ended up seeking other employment after feeling underappreciated and their displeasures falling on deaf ears.

There’s lots of great managers and coworkers but mostly EVERYONE IS LAZY!!!! I would not recommend working at Walmart. [ESPECIALLY THE ONE IN NORTH ATTLEBORO MASS!! Store #2366].

Walmart needs to be abolished,"Walmart stands for everything that is wrong with capitalism. There is no job security. Anyone who works at Walmart is made aware of just how dispensable they are. The work environment at Walmart fosters hostility amongst associates and management alike. Unrealistic and unreasonable expectations are thrust upon the employees.

Micromanagement and no appreciation for the employees ,"I worked for Walmart for over a year and a half, and I was not appreciated as an associate at all. I was only given one employee of the month award the first 4 months I worked there but never any other appreciation until I left this December, when I was the most outstanding employee in my department. No communication within the management and associates. It was impossible to be comfortable around the management cause I was afraid I would be yelled at again, for ridiculous antics that I never knew about.

Poor Management ,"I started working at Walmart purely as something temporary. I’m currently in the process of looking for a new job. The management at this location specifically is very poor. There’s always issues with associates as well as coaches or team leads being disrespectful towards others. It’s as if we are back in highschool. There is definite favoritism shown towards employees that have been at this location longer than others. They allow certain “”seasoned”” associates to take longer breaks, come in when they choose and do certain things they would reprimanded associates that have been there a shorter period of time for. I also have realized they put certain associates that they favor into leadership positions although they lack the qualifications for it as well as lacking respect for fellow associates. For the sake of your sanity, I honestly would not recommend working here unless it’s a last resort or just something very temporary.",1,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Winder, GA",1/3/23,2023,1,3

Soul-less Company,"The work expectations are sky high, but you're not set up for success. You will get in trouble for lack of productivity caused by other people or upper management. You have to check your online schedule every day that you're off because they could change it without notice. (They say that changing it on the app at least 24 hours before your shift is notice.)

Stay away from this facility! ,"Walmart, Bethlehem #4087 is by far the worst facility I have worked at. From a leadership perspective, there is one AGM who plays favorites with employee's and if she does not personally like you; you will get fired! She drives a culture based off of fear and treats most of her leadership team like they do not exist. When recruiting internal hires, she bases her decisions on who will pose the least amount of threat to her ideas and structure. All internal promotes are individuals who have no opinion and ""just fall in line"". She did not follow the interview process for promoting internal hires, she had a list and that is who we needed to promote. External/ internal individuals were not given a chance. As an employee in this warehouse, you are not allowed feedback; as if you do give it, you are subject to being retaliated against. This particular AGM is a toxin in the environment; however Walmart overall is a great company to work for. Huge opportunities for advancement and growth across the US.

I am doing the 60 boxes an hour and it isn't good enough they always want more even when your topped out. They will hire slow and old people. Then yell at them that there slow.

Debería ser un buen sitio para trabajar ,"Sin embargo, Walmart como empresa es un buen concepto. Son más de 5000 tiendas en USA, la diferencia entre una tienda con otra va a variar con el tipo de gente qué hay en ellas. Mi experiencia es negativa pues estoy en quizás sea la tienda más ocupada y que más vende en todo el país. En general, los managers, coach y lideres de mi tienda no están capacitados para asumir sus posiciones. No saben tratar a sus asociados. No saben cómo funciona una estructura organizacional, ser jefe o líder es más que eso, es estar en sintonía con las necesidades de la tienda y de cómo satisfacerlas con el equipo de asociados que tienes al mando. No hay respeto, orden, organización. En mi caso me ha tocado ver cómo el amiguismo y las preferencias particulares están por encima de los méritos, la preparación. También en nuestra tienda se ve mucho el privilegio de nacionalidad, los boricuas son los que mandan allí, dejando para ellos todas las posiciones y preferencias para ellos. Si no eres boricua, siempre estarás fuera de todo lo que por bien te pueda corresponder.  Un simple ejemplo: solicitar un tiempo de vacaciones cuando tu lo has planificado es casi imposible, o te las niegan o te las dan cuando a ellos les da la gana. Las bonificaciones trimestrales las eliminaron (conocidas como my share). No aumentan los sueldos acorde con el costo de la vida.

Pros and Cons,"Walmart can be okay based on what kind of management and how well staffed they are. I have had where certain store Assistant managers pushed all their overnight overstock and claims onto the front end. They would pull front end to stock and help but not vice versa and let the other employees that were being helped, mess around. They would keep those who make large shrink or money lose stay, but those who have health issues or need any sort of simple accommodation are let go. See how impractical? If you work there, then work to move up and push as much as possible. You got to be willing to take everyday working long hours, people being absolutely rude, theft, almost no time off, etc. Otherwise you will get stuck and not be able to move up in the company whatsoever. I have tried moving up several times. I pushed and pushed, but because I took days off due to health I couldn’t. I have already been in a management position before at small grocery store for almost a year but left it because of moving locations. I was pretty young but I moved up within six months there. I constantly worked all the time at Walmart. I even helped the team leads with their tasks, including filling in for them. I would always jump to help out. Point out the issue with certain things. Although, I watched those who got in trouble and such keep or move up in position. You have to be willing to accept a scenario like that.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"New Philadelphia, OH",12/30/22,2022,12,30

bad communication,"Understaffed afternoon shift, overstaffed morning shift, and everything are either 100% done or 100% overdue. Managers are barely available to talk and trying to move positions or change your schedule is a nightmare in itself. Continuous changes are made without informing anyone so you have to run around and ask everyone before you can get stuff done. It is just very tedious and would be 100% better if it weren't for the continuous communication problems since all the people are pretty chill.

Great people but horrible work life balance,95% of the people you work with are awesome!  Lots of room to grow and move up in the company if you work hard.  But the work life balance is just way too harsh.  Almost every weekend and holiday you will work.  Benefits are good and vacation time.  But as a salaried manager getting to use that vacation is hard.  So many blocked off times you can't take vacation and finding a slot where other managers have not taken makes it almost impossible to use all your vacation in which you lose all but a little say the ends of the year if not used.  Not for a family driven person,3,Former Employee,Coach ,"Kokomo, IN",12/30/22,2022,12,30

It was a job,"It was a very fast paced job, constantly on your feet. Nice coworkers majority of the time but management was not. Management liked to watch your every move, even when they were not at work they were watching. They tracked how fast you went, how many items it took per second. They acted like they cared for there employees and “cheered them on” but it was more of a threat than anything. It’s not easy to get promoted, they will promote someone who doesn’t do anything compared to someone who constantly works overtime and is hardworking. It is very hard to take off for anything unless you have PTO, No PTO no appts, or family time.

Beware of Working for Walmart,"Walmart was the worst mistake I ever made in my professional career.  I started there as a stocker and when I left the company (five years later) I was a department manager over the deli (now known as an academy trainer).  The work is a challenge because you have to work so many different positions.   Full time manager, part time stocker working frozen and refrigerated stock, part time customer service rep, and let's not forget cleaning tasks that seem to go out the window because you are never fully staffed at any time.  The management team always seems to be keenly unaware of any of this and will walk your department with arms crossed asking why things look the way they do and all the while you're the only person currently working in the entire department.  Do yourself a favor and do not work here.  The plus side is that the pay is ok.  The benefits are really good.  You will meet some of the nicest people you have ever met working here.  There are still quite a few people who I am still in contact with that mean the world to me.  ",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,Somewhere in Tennessee,12/30/22,2022,12,30
Overall weird management ,If you were sick you couldn’t just call out you had to use ppto to cover you and if you didn’t have enough you had to come in or you would get a strike.

I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression for the first time because of how stressful the work is. Work/life balance is nonexistent. Expect calls to come work on your off days.I learned that great management can make a positive influence on the attitude of the team and how smoothly the day goes, but most are too focused on meeting the company’s unrealistic goals. The workload is increasing and the pay isn’t. Many technicians don’t feel appreciated and respected as a result. I do like the benefits and the 401k. That’s it.

Great Work Enviorment,As a coach you have a lot on your plate. Your hours are dictated by how busy the store is. During peak months like November and December it is not uncommon to work 10-12 hour days. If you are a well organized person capable of effective time management you will do well. How you like the job depends almost entirely on the store you’re assigned to and your store manager. If you have a good store manager chances are you will love the job,4,Current Employee,Coach ,"Greenville, SC",12/28/22,2022,12,28

They will question you about days off you request and make promises that you can alternate holidays with other associates within the department and don't fulfill those promises. So many people that work here are LOYAL and longtime employees who don't deserve this kind of treatment from managers who weren't even born before the manager started working there.

They cut hours constantly and expected more to get done, put every thing on task timers, you got to the point you hate when a customer stoped you to ask a question or just to talk … not because you didn’t want to help but you know it was taking time from your assignment and if you don’t get the task done you get “written up” so slowly customer service was not a priority. I could write a book on the behind closed doors conversations that were just sad treatment of associates. They don’t value anyone and see them all as replaceable.

Above-Average Retail Environment Without Wiggle Room,"The biggest issue you'll hear consistently from employees involves the ""points"" system. You get one ""point"" for missing a day (regardless of a proper medical/other excuse) and a half-point for being late/early. Five or more points is an automatic termination unless you work something out personally with management who will look at your track record for attendance and whatnot. Other than that (which you only circumvent by applying PPTO/PTO that accumulates slowly), it's a competitively paying job. Management is pretty streamlined and there's always a ""higher up"" to talk to via an open door policy if you need. Some elements of the job can be frustrating because you have such limited power as a normal associate, so you end up redirecting people to different phone numbers or management. Day-to-day is pretty simple and can be enjoyable.",3,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Marietta, OH",12/26/22,2022,12,26

Be prepared during the holidays to be overwhelmed and around the 10th of every month when people get their food stamps. The attendance policy is very strict, so it's in your best interest to make sure you can get to work on time every single day. You will be doing a lot of walking, so dress work appropriately for the weather and buy a good pair of shoes. Do not just stand around; that's how you get behind. Work at a consistent pace, and your day will go by much faster.Make sure you ask questions if you don't know something. Your coworkers and most likely your managers are willing to help you, especially since if you make a mistake, it butterfly affects everyone else.Lunch breaks are pretty good. Minimum 30min but up to an hour. You usually get two 15min. If your manager forgets about your breaks, don't hesitate to ask for one yourself. They can't tell you not to take one.

So every time a customer needs something from those areas we had to unlock it for them every single time. The problem was you also had to carry everything they get up to a register, and sometimes it can just be too much.The customers will be complaining to me like i locked everything up specifically because of them. and on top of that the managers want you to deep zone the clothing section u were given for the day, so they wanted us to keep things super clean. and on top of that all phone calls made to that store goes straight to apparel. So we have to transfer all of the calls to different departments. And when those departments don’t pick up, the calls goes back to apparel, and now the customer is angry at you so they ask for a manager. You might be thinking ok the manager can help me with this customer thats yelling at me on the phone. Nah, they not coming every singlemanager will ignore ts outta you.

Great temp job,This in not a career. I became a TL over in my opinion the most stressful department in every store which was fine because from the very start of my personal shopper days I said I wanted that job so I am very very appreciative for the people I worked with and the SM for giving me the position I wanted when it opened. This was a really fun and chill job but there were a few things I didn't love: If people had too many points I was forced to fire them no matter what... I had people who didn't do anything ever but they lasted much much longer than any of my hardest workers even though I was in a right to fire state. I didn't like the fact that they wouldn't let me work... I almost never got more than 40hrs a week even though I was willing to work in any department on any project any hours of the day. The only other thing I could complain about was the job security/advancement: I thought one day I might become a coach until I asked to be. When I did every coach said DONT DO IT. Even the temporary SM said he thinks I could do it but didn't recommend it so why would I work my hardest if there's no more growth opportunities? And for the job security we weren't taught to give you any warning whatsoever. If you did something wrong or you had too many points one day you'd come to work and be fired. But overall I really truly do recommend getting a job at Walmart whether it be for a year or two years like me but I don't recommend to think after 5 years you'll be making any more because Walmart got rid of promotions!

I couldn't ask for a better leader!!!What is the most stressful part about working at the company?I work in Produce so I'd have to say the following: when I need to stock an item that is almost out or fully out, I will literally have to wait for people to move aside as they stand right in front of the item I'm trying to stock and then they ask me if they can just take their pick from the box because they're not patient enough to wait until I transfer the product into the bin. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment is fast paced, fun, sometimes drama filled and always different due to the volume of customers for that day & duties to be done.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I come in, do a sweep of produce then check in with my team about how the morning was. I then go take pictures of what is low so I can go to the ""fridge"" and stock my cart. I stock produce, go take my break, help keep the back room clean, stock more - more...",5,Current Employee,Produce Employee ,"Denver, CO",12/19/22,2022,12,19

Negative ,"Don't do it. The management doesn't care about you at all. They will go against workers comp restrictions and when you get hurt worse and can't come in to work they then point you for it. They employ team leads who will literally look at you and roll their eyes and treat you like garbage all night and then try to be your best friend for something. Interview process is simple and if you can find a good store then go for it , but as a company they are going downhill. The management/coaches/team leads are not there for you , only for them and if you go to a coach about a problem with a team lead they will laugh it off like it's a joke and not take you seriously. If you find a good coach than most of the team leads will be bad and won't do anything on the floor to help anyone , many nights I spent doing 2-3 maintenance associates jobs by myself and being told if it doesn't all get done you could get coached or in trouble. I promise you it isn't worth it",1,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance ,Virginia,12/17/22,2022,12,17
Very inefficient.,"I love the retail industry and have been trying to find a place where I fit in for years. I will say that Walmart has a long way to go before it can start recruiting quality people. Trust me; you're going to need them in the future. But your environment doesn't allow for forward-thinking people. For example, every store has a problem with accuracy in stocking. The labor losses are uncalculatable, seriously! When people come up with ideas to solve the problem, they are often ignored, and this leads to a loss of purpose, causing productivity to go down. There is also a massive problem with nepotism and backdoor dealing. If it were productive, I would have a problem with the practice, but this isn't the 1990s anymore, and the old guard needs to be changed.",3,Former Employee,Cap 1 Stocking Team Member ,"Rockford, IL",12/17/22,2022,12,17
Exhausting yet fun job that feels like a scavenger hunt.,I love my job itself. Being a personal shopper is a lot of fun it genuinely feels like a scavenger hunt/Easter egg hunt trying to go and find all the products. However it is very exhausting and very long hours. I literally wake up every morning feeling like I got hit by a truck From the work shift the night before getting off at eight. The management is horrible And it feels like high school with all of them. I do however adore some of my team leads.and the rules are way too strict and by the book. But what do you expect it’s Walmart. The number one hardest part though is trying to do your job while having customers constantly coming up to you asking you questions and needing help while you are on a strict timeline for each shop/pick we call them. Yes of course I am a Walmart associate so I need to help the customers but it makes me feel like I have 1 million jobs all at once. The other difficult part about working there is seeing the way parents treat their children… I live in an area with very high poverty and crime and all of these individuals are very traumatized therefore they’re just repeating the cycle and it’s so hard to be around and not say something to them. It’s unbelievable some of the things that come out of these parents mouths. One time I had a grandmother hit her grandchild a four-year-old right across the face and swear at her and directly after I walked by and she so sweetly and kindly asked me for help for something and I walked right on by and acted like she didn’t exist.

Salaried management is trash,"A typical day of work at Walmart will leave you feeling mentally, physically and emotionally drained, unappreciated, and unaccomplished. In my time working for this company I learned that management does not care about its associates, only what they can produce and will pick and choose who they want to fire. There is no type of accountability held for salaried managers and they get away with murder. The cultural environment at Walmart is the complete opposite of the beliefs of which it claims to stand on. You could be the best associate but there is no recognition or praise, and as soon as you make one mistake, you are no longer of use and you will know based off of how you are treated. The hardest part of the job would have to be resisting the urge to snap back at entitled customers who only see one side of things. They don't know that different departments throughout the store are not on process and are not being held accountable for not being on process. The most enjoyable part of the job are the hourly associates. Despite the issues listed above, they still show up even when things are horrible and work together as a team to get the job done at the end of the day.  They also only give a 10% discount to associates and it does not discount grocery items. ",1,Current Employee,Wal-Mart digital team lead ,"Hagerstown, MD",12/17/22,2022,12,17

Challenging work environment with variety of change,"Every day is different. Despite doing repetitive tasks (working at register, watching self checkouts, etc.), there is always a new challenge. However, most of the customers and employees are not satisfied with how efficient the store is. Due to understaffing, registers are not staffed, meaning self checkouts are more frequently used. If they have issues, it can range how long the problem will be fixed.

If you don't fit in socially with your Team leads or coach they will find a reason to terminate you regardless of job performance. I've been on both ends of the pecking order unfortunately.

A hot mess with sprinkles of good,"Walmart is by far the most stressful place to work during the holidays.  I started my first day with 30 minutes of shadowing... and that was the training I received to start - as was the case for everyone who started with me.  Team leads always seemed to disappear when needed, and breaks are constantly forgotten if you are not the forceful type.  Even when I changed positions, I have constantly been left on my own to attend to a whole department because either no one is scheduled or my coworkers get pulled elsewhere.  I love the people I work with, but upper management inspires zero loyalty due to constantly changing expectations, shifting around manpower randomly, and cutting corners at every turn.My direct manager at the moment, and the coaches I have directly workedI with are great people though, and the main reason I can stomach working at Walmart.

Lots of drama was in the back room constantly, and no attempt was made to be at least by Walmart standards ""professional"". The work is not hard in general, and its somewhat stable. If you call in 3 times without using time then you can get fired with their point system - 3 strikes and you're out! I would recommend this place for entry level jobs and young kids.

Its a job , I have seen a lot in three years … When I started in this company it was pretty good for what it was . Then things started going downhill a few months in . There is no work life balance . U can’t miss much for any reason or u wont have a job . It fits best with high school and college kids . They have special treatment for work rules and school schedules . But the attitudes of most staff is unpleasant . This is supposed to be a customer based company but a lot of employees can’t seem to stand people ?? It’s also supposed to be a family based company but  it is very clear that only the company is important and everything else is unimportant.  I have also witnessed the worst employees in 2 locations are the ones treated like gems while the ones giving it there all  suffer . I believe this used to be a decent company to work for at one time but  like many other companies in the last ten years or so .the focus is on cutting employees to the bare minimum and then constantly running short when a few don’t show or quit from mistreatment or better pay .  And u don’t dare call in  unless u want to be down talked about  by your team and probably others in the store whether u are a good employee or not  and whether u have a good reason or not .   It seems to be treated like a sin .  These things I have witnessed and been subjected to  almost daily  . Unfortunately at this time I do not recommend anyone not in school or in dire need of employment to get tied to this company . It has some things to work out before it’s back to what it was . ,2,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Fairfield, IA",12/13/22,2022,12,13

"Productive, Fun environment, fast paced, busy","I learned a lot about leadership and patience. On a typical day, you'll have some angry customers, but the customer is always right. Keep a smile on your face and do the best you can to be helpful. Management is known to not be the best, but in my experience, it was pretty good. The worst thing to happen was employees such as myself were expected to perform leadership roles and responsibilities while only being paid the job we were hired for. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy and being able to work alongside your coworkers, The hardest part of the job was working while understaffed and trying to handle things you were not necessarily prepared for.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Fairbanks, AK",12/13/22,2022,12,13

Horrible work environment ,At the time I was a minor and this was my first ever job. They treated me with respect up until I was officially hired.

OK place to work but stressful,Overall a ok place. Pay is low in comparison to most jobs currently. The job itself is busy work and usually no problem to do once you get used to it. The time limits expected are usually a bit unreasonable and management usually will come and interrupt you with a different task but still expect the other task to be completed at the time they gave you. Customers are not taken into consideration in the  time equation. Nor does management care about how many customers you helped. they just want you to have it done when they say. No excuses. Managers will often give conflicting orders by two different management and expect theirs to be done in spite of what the other manager told you to do. ,3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Chattanooga, TN",12/13/22,2022,12,13
The worst place to work,Managers are always children who act like their in high school. The managers never help or do any work. They promote the laziest of all people.

Ethically speaking just run. ,1,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Sevierville, TN",12/13/22,2022,12,13
1 star,"What is the best part of working at the company?Meeting and greeting the customers. Some are super nice which allowed me to be myself.

The other stressful part is coworkers not wanting to do as good as you, or even do their part, so when you come to work you end up having to do twice the work.

When you confront them about never having a day off, their answer is always ""It happens like that sometimes"". But then the next day they're gone on another vacation after just getting back the day before. Management sucks, the idea of having coaches and team leads never benefits anyone because no one communicates with each other, EVER. All Walmart and the store managers care about is money and greed and power. They do not care about customer needs or employees. If they did they'd give us a day off once in a while or stop declining our requests off after putting in the request 6 months prior or at your interview, they still deny it, but then approve someone else's for the same day.

Productive work place but poor management ,The job started out great and I'm thankful for the many things and skills I learned at this job. I met a lot of great people and customers along the way.

They don't try to help you move up and don't listen to other people's opinions and input to improve the work environment.,3,Former Employee,Seasonal Sales Associate ,"Waverly, OH",12/12/22,2022,12,12
Horrible management they’re all bullies ,"I was at Walmart for about 3 months and I really liked it at first, the team leads were the only thing keeping me there after a bit tho. The management likes to blame the team leads for people quitting but it’s 100% the management. They will talk down to associates and they never communicate with you unless it’s negative. They really don’t like apparel workers at this store and blame them for how the store looks. It’s hard to keep 5 departments clean and organized at one of the biggest retail stores, but the managers do nothing to help they just over load and judge you if you can’t finish all the tasks they assign. They also won’t allow you to communicate or work with your team properly, they’d rather everyone just shut up and work like robots.

"Lots of work, fair pay","Shortened review for those who don't like reading. This is a job where you mainly self govern, have constant work to do, have constant customer interaction, customers can be a coin flip of either very nice or rude and entitled, fair pay, fair benefits, opportunity for overtime, flexible hours, little training, friendly coworkers, often have vague goals, not very toxic workplace, just many feel slightly overworked and undervalued, easy to learn, lots to learn. I recommend only working here if you can manage, or want to learn to manage, a large amount of fast paced and stressful work.For a longer review of my time here:The workload is usually pretty high here. That can be good and bad. Constant customer interaction is guaranteed. Social skills, problem solving, and good memory are a must to help with customers. You will experience many nice and some rude customers every day. ""Small town syndrome"" is very prevalent here so keep that in mind when interacting with customers.Never enough floor people to get stock out and backroom overflows into the sales floor often. Management knows the workers that do work the stock onto shelves are not miracle workers and only expect you to go as fast as possible which allows you to focus on keeping a good work pace and manage yourself. Workplace climate is not very toxic. The overall attitude is that everyone is slightly overworked and many feel undervalued. Morale can be pretty low sometimes because of the low retention of workers, high workloads, undertrained workers, inconsistent expectations, and vague goals to get done.

Worst company to stick behind,"Walmart doesn’t care about employees. If you’re late 15 minutes you get half a point. If you’re late 3 hours but call in you get half a point. If you don’t show up and call in it’s 1 point. It takes 6 months for your points to fall off. So, if you’re 15 minutes late, you have to wait half a year for it to fall off.

Worst place ,Walmart does not care about their employees. It is all about the bottom line for them. They don’t pay based on how long you have been there. There are employees who have worked for them for a really long time who get paid less than the new employees they are hiring. If they don’t like you they do everything they can to firer you.

Worst Company ,"I’ve never worked for a company so selfish, greedy  and unorganized. After working at several locations both south and midwest I can agree that management overall doesn’t appreciate the workers along with a heavy presence of favoritism throughout the entire facility. Although they need the help, they refuse to allow overtime so they can keep whatever’s left in the budget for the quarterly bonuses for themselves. Management  was clueless and would often ask me for help on how to perform job functions/task that shouldve been taught during training and/or known for as long as they’ve been in their positions. Unfortunately I will never work for Walmart again and I will never refer anyone as management often lies and isn’t to be trusted.

It’s not great ,I’ve worked for Walmart for 2 years I’m a normal ogp associate at the Norris freeway store I took pride in my work the first year I loved it I took on a menttee role which is being a lead without the pay I’m the most knowledgeable associate in the department I run the department constantly which is fine I chose to do have the knowledge and will to do so but I do not get the pay I’m constantly called on my off time if I ever have an issue it’s almost like it’s a problem even though I’m always on time and stay over I’ve had multiple lead interviews but I suspect that my store manager tells them to not promote me the real killer was for me on 12/09/22 I needed to go on a leave of absence because my grandmother was put in the hospital and I was called and told my leave may get denied which is absolutely ridiculous considering other employees have left for and entire week for issues that should not even require a leave I could write a book about the shady things I’ve seen market and store management do and overall bad experiences company has good perks and pto but if your managers are terrible you’ll hate it ,2,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Knoxville, TN",12/10/22,2022,12,10

It's like a home away from home,"Strong emphasis that this is a Neighborhood Market considered, (vastly smaller than a Superstore) this was my favorite job I've ever worked. It felt like family. Management was happy to accommodate my schedule, friendly, and was good at steering employees towards success. The position was easy to learn and master. The Front End Associate position is very rewarding. You'll most likely be cashiering or watching the self-checkout section.

Being a cake decorator is great the rest is bad,"I love being able to decorate cakes, but having to deal with stocking and the no training or proper leadership is terrible. When I first started my manager only spoke Spanish, which is fine if I did to but I didn't. I think they assumed I did because of my name but they were wrong. The manager would not speak to me or customers who had issues because she said she didn't understand, she wouldn't even answer the phone. It was not fair at all that I had to try and learn everything on my own but then realized that no one in the department was doing things correctly.  So every week I have to spend 5 to 7 hours in a freezer that is at below freezing to reorganize the freezer correctly so inventory can be done correctly. I have to redo just about every one else's work so that it is correct. I also love making people happy with beautiful cakes but people get very upset when I tell them that I need at least a 24 hour notice for custom cake designs, I mean these people knew about the birthday all year and it's my fault I can't squeeze you in with 13 other orders for that day. But I think besides the vision center or pharmacy it is one of the best positions in the store. ",3,Current Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Manor, TX",12/9/22,2022,12,9

Management isn’t the best at all,"It’s not a bad place to work due to some people you work with, but management will make you do jobs you didn’t even apply for.

Long wait time/Not enough work,Walmart Spark started off great but has went downhill quickly.  Walmart Spark has saturated the market with drivers.  As a result round robin orders are sporadic.

Great Company to work for!,"During my employment with Walmart, here is what comes to mind as, ""The Good & The Bad"" with reguards to being apart of the Walmart Family:The Good: Overall, it's a Great place to work, with good benefits and great compensation! Walmart offers plenty of opportunities to grow within the company world wide. And continuous training thru out your employment to keep associates up-to-date on policies and proceedures. And I can only speak on the store location where I was empolyeed, but the Management Team, I worked for, with 1 execption, was Awesome! They really want their associates to suceed. Using positive reinforcement to keep the crew motivated. Most of the Management Team proved to be very helpful, understanding, and supportive. And show that they truly care about their associates. The Bad: Walmart's attendance policy is based on a point system. If you reach 5 points, you are discharged. This is a fair non-bias system that's black and white. The problem with the system is that points add up very quickly. And the only thing that counters these points are ""PPTO"", which unfortunately don't always add up as quick as the points. Which leads to a high turn-over rate. But luckily, being discharged for reaching the attendance points max, means that you can be re-hired after the minimum waiting period.In a nutshell, Walmart is a Great place to work, and I'd encourage anyone who is interested to apply.  I can't wait to rejoin the Walmart Team! ",5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocking Associate ,"Anchorage, AK",12/7/22,2022,12,7

It's generally what you expect from Walmart,"I work overnights so my experience is a little different than others. I've been working overnights for two years now and I've primarily worked as a stocking associate. Working overnights currently is fairly easy since the store closes at 11 p.m. and opens at 6 a.m. so there isn't a whole lot of customer interaction besides the occasional helping a customer find something. The job itself is fairly easy, they do require you to be able to lift at least 50 lbs and depending on which department you're in you could be lifting heavy things for your whole shift. Rarely is it ever that long but it is something you should consider if applying. At my store the managers will try to keep you away from lifting heavier items if it's something that you can't do or are hurt as long as you bring it to their attention. While they are fairly receptive to that, management is a big issue with most Walmart's. Training new hires can vary drastically, from a person who's been there for years training with them for a couple of days to what happened to me where a person who had been there two days trained me on my first day. Even a few months into me working there they would have me train someone instead of a more experienced worker because of how that worker would respond toward that manager for making them train. In fairness to the worker there isn't a dedicated person to train the new hires so the new person is constantly thrown around between workers creating a melting pot of information for the new hire and more often than not leaving out information because it isn't applicable in the situation. - more...",4,Current Employee,Stocking Associate ,"Chandler, OK",12/7/22,2022,12,7

The management ignores a lot of the complaints of workers and customers, I guess you could say disorganization is a daily thing and it contributes to some of the very issues that they have YOU trying to solve. The front end generally speaking; if you do stocking all your breaks are at once. Front end, people would push their 15's to an hour and not get in trouble.

The company also provides job security and advancement opportunities, so employees can grow and develop their careers. Walmart also offers a variety of training and development programs to help employees gain skills and knowledge.On the negative side, many Walmart employees report feeling underpaid and overworked. Many employees feel that they are not treated fairly and that their work is not appreciated. Additionally, the retail giant is often criticized for its poor labor practices, such as scheduling employees for short shifts and failing to provide adequate benefits.Overall, working at Walmart can be a rewarding experience.

The problem of the ""teaming"" philosophy at Walm-mart means that you will have to do your work, plus other team leader's work if they are behind or not present.  Many employees are lazy and never held accountable. On the flip side if you are a hard worker expect management to pile more and more onto your plate. There are leaking ceilings in about 20 places, I've seen all 6 electric carts broken at one time, and as an associate you will hear customer complaints constantly.

It’s not bad at first but it takes a tole on your body. You given “X” weeks to reach performance goal’s after that you’re expected to stay at 100% every shift. Falling below to many times leads to meetings with managers and eventually write up. If you’re sick and don’t have ppto “personal protected time off “ and need to leave work there’s 1/2 to 1 point. Same goes for any other thing life throws at you. No time have a point. They call it accountability but at times it more like indentured servitude.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?If you’re in management you really can get away with anything. Coworkers will form groups and can be difficult to get in at first but after awhile you can meet some good people. What is a typical day like for you at the company?I can only speak to the evening crew, as I have not worked the morning or weekend shift. You report to work do pre shift stretches, you have a BS pre shift meeting where they talk about how well you did.

You will work 4 10-hour shifts during the week, or 3 12-hour shifts on the weekends. Before the recession there were tons of opportunity for overtime, still are for some areas.Management is poor overall, although there are some good ones too. Most managers don't appreciate the hard work that you do and give you little recognition. Some often cater to their worst employees, and of course their favorites or the employees who suck up to them. The place is very political and very hard to advance. Most people who get promoted are done so over people who are far more deserving. Buddy up with the managers or you will never go anywhere. HR is horrible for the most part, although there are some good and nice people in the department. The head of HR there is one of the shadiest people I've ever met. Overall, the job is pretty good. Great place if you are just looking for a job that pays well. Lot's of paid days off as well, and you can usually get time off if you ever have something going on.

Used to be better for cashier.,"It was not the worst for the position. The position as a cashier is easy and fun.However, they have practically eliminated cashiers for self checkouts. As a cashier, it was not uncommon to be put to work in other departments to help out. This could be fun or not, it depends on what one is asked to do.It is retail and the pay was not so good. Disappointing to find out that getting a review and payraise was dependent on the team and not personal performance so practically impossible to get a raise unless it was a raise for everyone. For instance, when they brought up the new hire raise one dollar, all who were at that rate got it but people who were working there for years got no benefit from it at all.

Alright job,The job seems easy enough. It’s definitely exactly what you think it is. Simply going a filling online orders for the store.

When they raise the starting pay for positions they don’t raise their long term associates pay to that amount. They Took hourly associates my share away and gave them all a 1.00 raise that didn’t make up for the 700 or 800 dollar bonus they received every quarter.

Micro managed,The salary managers are tought to micro manage as much as possible and are the furthest thing from actual leaders. TEAM LEADS do all the actual work but get paid a fraction of micro managers.  There is absolutely no work/life balance as a team leader. Someday you work 3p-12p and then they want you back the next day from 6a-3p. No set schedules to plan a life. You belong to walmart and they treat you as such.

New associates being hired in with no experience making almost the same as a 15 year associate. Raises given out were small and infrequent after yearly evaluation process changed.PTO was easy to earn if full time, but not as a part time associate. Medical benefits were pretty fair but premiums for family plans could be high, depending on coverage selected.

"Many benefits, but poor management.","The company provides many benefits for employees, however lacks in management. The main thing that stands out to me about working there, is that management’s timeframes for getting tasks done is very unrealistic. Even if you push yourself very fast, you often still get told you are too slow.  And if you give genuine reasons for why it wasn’t done in time, they never actually consider what you are saying, and are very poor at understanding you when you voice concerns.

Great Pay Bad Leaders ,"The hours are all over the place and completely stupid you can’t have 2 days off in a row. There is no work life balance and that can take a toll on your personal life. Management lacks self awareness and accountability. The main issue with this role is you report to the store manager, however, the market manager needs you to complete their tasks as well. The store manager does not care and pulls people constantly to fulfill their needs which results in your team not getting anything done.

Otherwise, the job becomes too sedentary. I like to move around a lot and this position is not conducive to that.The actual act of receiving shipments is not difficult at all. But managing inventory while receiving conflicting instruction to keep the bins full but empty and worked out creates stress.

"Honest work, decent pay, good people, difficult management culture","Walmart without the political end of things is a slowly evolving company whose mission is to help people live better by saving money. Goods and services tend to be cheaper than elsewhere, and the team / family outlook of any given Walmart tends to be positive if with growing pains. The biggest challenge to Walmart culture, lie in its management style. Under the happy to help front, the challenge occurs with management where the associate now in charge of directing people learns that the typical manager at Walmart is corporate minded and racing to fill orders and committed to themselves and making the business profitable with the least amount of loss possible. Often the ""it can be done"" attitude of upper management is returned with ""have you considered the chaos theory?""

Very boring at times but very fun depending on who I worked with ,"This company is sometimes very stressful to work for Scheduled 9hours with an hour lunch and 2 15min breaks one in the beginning and one tords the end of ur shift with a lunch in the middle Upper management was terrible I had to run the front end at times by myself an me being new to the position not even having it for more then a month I was stuck alone half the time not knowing wtf I was doing And it seemed like every time I was scheduled to close I had very little ppl on my shifts not enough customer service employees to keep customer service up so I had to close that early a lot as well as enough cashiers past 5pm so I had to close registers down early as well because we had to accommodate our self checkout areas.Management was the reason why I quit the lack of help provided I would call to have more ppl come up and ring on the registers because I didn’t have enough ppl and would get ignored I had to call for ppl to help push carts cause our cart pushers always called off I just couldn’t handle it Walmart really needs to get it together The hardest part was just having to manage the front end alone when ur short staffed and having certain managers on duty that u know ain’t going help to help The best part was just getting that wonderful paycheck because one thing good about Walmart is they paid really good Benefits provided heath,vision and dental plus 401k after a year matched PTO after 90 days PPTO once hired earned on a weekly basis ",2,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"Cranberry Township, PA",11/27/22,2022,11,27

Poor managerial organization ,"I could spend years commenting on Walmart's dismal employee relations attributes, but I'll only say at this time that, based upon the frequency of occurrences, the managers (irregardless of Dept or rank) seemed to be more interested in finding as many opportunities as possible to stroll around the store together chatting it up and joking, than tending to the [incredibly crucial and pressing] needs of the employees.You can double that criticism with respect to the customers.I worked there for ~20 months.That was 19 months too many.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,Automotive ,11/26/22,2022,11,26

full of drama especially from the leads ,"I worked here for a few months third shift and in that time I quickly saw what made the job quite awful. One big example were the leads and coach they like to gossip behind employees backs personally heard it myself. No one really likes one any one else here they purely tolerate one another if you missed your shift half of the group would talk bad about you how they don't like you then when you're there you turn in to their friend. If you wish to work quietly and avoid all that as I tried to they'll actually assume you're ""slow"" and treat you as such.  As for the job its self don't expect much of a social life or to really get much done at home the long over night hours eventually take their toll on you. The job its self was quite simple and honestly not difficult at all. But in all I would sadly avoid third shift stocking till the Third Shift Leads are replaced OR stop treating the place like its a high school and act like adult's and stop gossiping on fellow employees and actually act like management.

Spills cleaned, can't hear when a spill is called while I'm wanted in the bathrooms the entire shift. As well as keeping the autoscrubber running and maintained.

Understanding Work Envirnment,"Through the 4 years employed at Walmart I was placed in 3 Departments. First was Deli/Bakery, in it I learned how to deep clean certain equipment and listen the what the Customers would prefer. The hardest part of the Job was having little management when questions arose and being targeted when things did not go as expected. Second was Produce Department, in it I learned how to fill the sales floor and double checking dates to make sure everything was safe for the consumers. Lastly was the Overnights' Maintenance, where I leaned how to take apart the Meat/ Wet wall specifically and deep clean them. We also learned how to take apart and fix other aspects of the sales floor to ensure that the customers and employees remained safe while the store was open.

The experience you will have and the work environment overall is highly dependent on the store’s management. I’ve worked at stores where the upper management isn’t all that great and it trickles down to the employees and creates chaotic stores that are always messy and underperforming due to lack of training and not-so-great morale.

dont care about employees,15 years ago was a great place to work. through the years its changed to a management team that okays favorites and retaliates if you speak up for what's right. I've seen managers erase points for people they like and not for others they don't like. I've heard them speak about associates in front of me about my peers negatively when that's not professional.

They Don't Care about Medical Concerns or Life Altering Events,"They put up a good front on there website, but don't be fooled. From outrageous medical policies, to no support for lower ranking workers or workers suffering a life altering event, it's the worse job I think I've ever had. They have a policy that doctors notes do not count as excused absences and any medical related time off (from a doctors note) that is three days or under doesn't even qualify for a leave of absence. You have to talk to a third party accommodation and LOA center to get those approved, and anything three days or under, you can be terminated for. Too many absences gets you fired, any job is like that. However even if it's due to a medical problem, you can be fired if it is under three days of leave. It doesn't matter to try and get the leave though because their third party LOA business is near impossible to get ahold of. The management is rude and looks down ok lower ranking employees and they get a power trip by making employees feel like they aren't good enough.

Amazing people to work with.,"There's plenty of amazing people here to work with once you get to know them all and build and rapport with them. Management is very much centered around picking a favorite employee and focus on improving them, however. Generally, you'll start your day off in your department by learning what the manager has assigned for each person there and then doing it. Each department is also like their own little cliques in high school, but everyone usually gets along well. Expect to do a lot of shelf-stocking and cashier work in the busier departments as well.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",11/17/22,2022,11,17

",4,Former Employee,Consolidation ,"Union City, GA",11/17/22,2022,11,17
Management sucks ,They have too many managers over seeing everything and everyone who do nothing but walk around and watch you do the work. They don't ask or tell you about a last minute schedule changes. They don't offer any free food in the break room you have to pay for the vending machines. Need to train more people on the forklift who can actually function and understand directions.  the pay was ok definitely not really worth it for how physical the job is.,1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Cleburne, TX",11/17/22,2022,11,17

"Great Coworkers, Absentee Boss",I was sent to work on the cashier desk after 8 hours of video training in one day. Very fun! I felt directionless most of the time but I had coworker (not my boss or team lead btw) who were very helpful but it sucked because they were doing someone else's job for free?

Awful place to work for,"Now, per my experience, I hated working for Walmart. My management team didn’t care about the employee or their health they just wanted work. I tore my achilles two weeks out starting, but pulling the personal shopper cart and management made it out to be my fault. I worked in a boot for two months and the only question I ever got was, ‘How much longer do you need to be back here?’  They hated that I had a boot on and had to stay in one spot all day, I did too. They would not let me sit down, even though I rarely saw customers and I had a doctors not stating that I need to sit occasionally. The only option I was given was to lean on the counter. All in all, loved what I did, hated who I did it for. ",1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper/Sales Associate ,"Roanoke, VA",11/17/22,2022,11,17

Overall Walmart will be a great place to work if they mix match the customer service managers. Too much favoritism.,"Personally, I have an awesome coach and that’s what keep me there still, but customer service managers , they have a lot to do .? too much favoritism there. Will never recognize your hard work and instead favors their owns friends even if they not doing their job correctly. They lost a bunch of good employees because of that. Those employees will talk to us but never have the courage to talk to their coach or their store managers about discriminating, but instead they just look for another job that doesn’t have too much favoritism.

It's what you make of it,"It isn't a bad place to work if you're able to ignore the rudeness you will undoubtedly experience on a daily basis and simply follow the company policy as it's written. Some managers seem to go out of their way to be unreasonable, but it's not hard to go above their heads to protect yourself if the situation gets bad enough. Honestly though, it's amazing how well some managers will work with your schedule if you've got priorities outside of work.

"Management, needs to be talked about.","I’ve previously worked at UPS and Amazon. Recently was hired by Walmart - Seems amazing at first until I met my managers or “team leads” - They’re both disrespectful and rude to the workers. We unload trucks for 5-6 hours here and then spend the rest of our day sorting pallets up to 8ft tall. Every time we bust our a** off, we get told that it’s unacceptable that we can’t meet company timeframes. Not an exaggeration, ever since day one here. Every single day we’ve been told we’re too slow (as a group) when we’re literally about to pass out from exhaustion. We had one hour to down stack 6 pallets and organize them by aside. We were told to do it in one hour. That’s simply just not possible. For a bad wage, the work isn’t worth it. It’s not bad but it’s just not worth it. For the bad management, not worth dealing with for near minimum wage. The work is simple, the management give us unreasonable timeframes every single day, so we hear them whining at us every single day.

Life,I started working here in 2019 when the department was fairly new. We didn’t have many orders per hour and the job was really enjoyable.

Finally, most of the available jobs are also $15 an hourIf you hate high school drama then this is not the place for you. Childish drama is rampant at any level of the job. The customers were more pleasant. Management is very disorganized and takes people out of their departments to compensate for mistakes on their end.

"Easy job, terrible store","What should be as easy as 2nd hand nature gets fumbled by being severely understaffed year round. What is sometimes a fun work environment with great people, is also a very hectic and mismanaged work environment with stressed out co-workers. When you start, an unrealistic amount of information will simply be expected of you without your knowing, and this is due to the fast pace that this job demands. Best part- Day will go by very fast, decent pay (should be a little more to be honest), and some of the best people I’ve ever worked with. Made great friends. Worst part- Lack of associates after 2:00 PM, impossible tasks can sometimes be bestowed upon you (ex: getting a 100+ item pick walk that is due in 25 minutes), lack of devices, angry/ignorant customers, Regulated Walks, and the bright blue vest is the ugliest and most disgusting vile piece of clothing ever created, and they won’t even give you your correct size, because most of the time, they won’t have it.

But if you make friends here, they can start to feel like family which is nice.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I would usually start in frozen, maybe do grocery first but then i am pulling pallets, downstacking both frozen and other frozen areas onto a floor and a misc. pallet respectively, then stock clean and repeat until finished. After finishing frozen, I would usually go to the next worst area, dairy, and stock liquids in the cooler because nobody likes doing them. After my first two months I would say, I was almost purely frozen.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocking Associate ,"Hastings, MN",11/12/22,2022,11,12

Location Dependacy,"I have worked in 3 different stores so far and have learned this. Wal-Mart has processes to make the job easy. When you know what you are doing, it's easy. The only real problem will be the people in charge and your co-workers. As a whole, Wal-Mart is great. If the managers/co-workers are untrained, un-professional and have no motivation to work it can turn it into a nightmare.I would definitely recommended it a place to work keeping location in mind.

Great Pay not so great accommodation,I was hired as a cake decorator and after a month of working I started college again since the income was definite. I went to tell my managers of when I was starting and that my schedule would have to be the same during weekdays. I was told that I couldn’t be worked with even though another coworker had the same schedule changed. My okay choice was to leave or go somewhere else I. The building for $5 less than what I was making. Walmart CLAIMS to work with school schedules but I couldn’t seem to get that kind of help not matter that situation I could work with. I was also hired for part time so that I could make time for school and was working 40hours a week and when asked can they give me the part time hours I was threatened out of a job whenever I went to tell a manager that I was busy and couldn’t get to a task right at that moment and unprofessional. Let’s just say that I had to leave even when I didn’t want to. If you apply I would say make sure you have a set schedule and DONT accommodate for them when your schedule changes tell that you have a set schedule and will only work that schedule. Aside from that I really really loved my job it was the best one I’ve had by far other than management. (I was hit with a ten high and was ignored for several days by my team lead and nothing was done) I hope to find another cake decorator job with Walmart soon once a position is available. ,3,Former Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Chesapeake, VA",11/12/22,2022,11,12

"Work is okay, salaried management is awful, and everyone needs gossip to make it through a shift",Most people that work for Walmart are those who are there because there isn't any other option for them.

"Great coworkers, horrible management ","Working at Walmart has been one of the worst experiences I've had in the job industry. The people I work with are really nice and are there to help you if you need it but management is awful. Management doesn't care or they cannot be found most of the time and when they are found are usually useless. Management disrespects employees and disregards any concerns they may have. They do not hire enough people and do not care to hire enough people because it would get in the way of the general managers bonus at the end of the year. This this infranchises every employee there including other managers, and employees alike. They also make you do tasks that are not in your job description such as throwing freight when you're not a part of the freight team. You are not compensated for doing other people's jobs you are just paid the base rate of your position even if what you are doing would have you be paid more. HR is not much better due to them also not caring about whether or not you are being exploited as an employee. Most of these issues could be fixed with better management, better pay, or overall hiring more people to do the job.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Dyersburg, TN",11/11/22,2022,11,11

Not a real Trucking company but a grocery store with trucks big difference!!,"The whole 110k pay is a lie and a scam! They bring you in for a week of driving test and a week later for orientation which both can be done at the same time. But they do that to make sure you quit the job you're on so you can't just quit when you start working for them and realized you've been scammed. They pay every two weeks to make it look like you're making money but really only making $1400-1500 a week avg. You'll be jumping from truck to truck very often. Imagine unloading everything from tv, microwave, bedding, food in the frig multiple times a week. Trucks even the new ones are constantly breakdown and the old Pete's have close to a million miles on them that the shops can't fix. Be prepared to go OTR with the check engine light on and frontend shaking. You expect a company as big as Walmart to be better organized delivering to their own stores with better equipment. They get slow just like any other company. Safety is looking to fire you and will cancel all your loads and bring you back to your home terminal just to make you miss money and talk about you speeding that they can see from the GPS. You'll get call into the office for not doing a 360 walk-around when dropping a trailer or just getting fuel.

Lots of work for the same rate of pay ,Mismanagement to the extreme. They do not care about OGP at all. They will let your team struggle the entire day without giving any help.

Cashiering was alright, although the store manager made me go out to do carts way more than anyone in the cashier department.

Management fails to understand their job.,It's not uncommon to see regular associates having to clean the mess for the higher up salary members for regular pay.

Fast paced work environment around a diverse customer/employee setting.,"Walmart is a great place to interact and meet new people, while learning the ins and outs of the retail business.  There is a decent work/life balance with benefits that have potential for growth the longer you stay with the company.  The company has a leadership structure to help growth within the company per the associates desired level into management with multiple positions across stores. The pay structure is fair, as the company offers more starting pay than most companies, however, bonuses are no longer given to non-supervisor positions and annual raises are the same percentage across the board.

I worked in several areas, Lawn+Garden, Pets, Produce, DSD, Claims, and last was Online Grocery Picker (OGP). By far the easiest was OGP.

Horrible ,"Place is the worst place to work I have ever and will ever experience. You do not earn enough time off for your work, the place has a horrible and miserable atmosphere, and the management feel and act like children. Even if your store has good management and a friendly work environment (mine does not) the policy, pto, and ppto will make anyone feel like an indentured servant to an ungrateful company. The pay is just enough to where it is difficult to find another job with more money without experience, and this is done on purpose. A detrimental place to work at if you genuinely want to enjoy life while working a 9-5 job. And finally a god-awful cowardice attitude from all management that are unable to handle things for themselves at any point. The company for some reason feels it necessary to hire people that can be turned into lap dogs. That’s the only way to grow in the company so you can either conform or stay in the same position for 50 years. The company doesn’t care about you either way.

Poor pay and appreciation ,I think walmart needs to step up.  We don't get paid enough for the stuff we go through daily. It's a hard job and it takes a toll on each and everyone of us. We all have lives outside of this job and are all living paycheck to paycheck. Scraping the bottom of the paycheck after bills are paid to see what can be used for our impulses. Its sad working for a company and feeling stressed immediately when you enter its premises. I used to be happy working for this company now it's just a job. It's something to make my paycheck for my bills. I'm not happy anymore right now it's like an obligation.. I have to do it to live.  And that's the sad thing because I want to love my job but I don't. ,1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Virginia Beach, VA",11/9/22,2022,11,9

Walmart. Their slogan is not for the customers or employs. CEO just said that to save money on himself.,Working at Walmart as a stocking 2 associate was a nightmare. We had to pick up all the boxes of food and put them in creates which is normal. But morning shifts are suppose to finish at least one truck. We had to finish it for them. And the worst part is that after we are finished with hours of moving around. We had to bring these items to the sales floor. Once we go to the sales floor our team leader makes us take out the pallets within one hour or less. With no equipment or even a knife to open the boxes it be impossible to get it done in one hour. Worse then that if you didn't finish the pallet you would not be able to go to lunch till 7:30 when lunch starts at 6. It was just abusive. Worst part is that they say we in every sentence. I understand we as a team. But when its one person and a team leader. We just really means you. Team leads don't do much to help or even bring something to throw away all the boxes that are empty. This job was just bad.,1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"15601 SW 127th Ave, Miami, FL 33177",11/9/22,2022,11,9

Had ups and downs with certain coworkers, though management and team leads in my department were great, very nice, and very informative. I have gotten into trouble but who doesn't? It was entirely my fault yet they were so understanding and respectful when talking to me about it. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything was neat considering it was in the middle of the entire store. Customers can be very destructive when it comes to a pair of folded jeans or baby clothes. I would also say they needed a bit more work with being clear about certain things, communication. An experience I had while working there I had caught covid and asked off to get better, they didn't really answer me directly they just cleared my schedule which made me think I was fired and going up there after i had gotten better to ask about it was really embarrassing.

Very toxic. ,"I am speaking from experience from Gadsden Alabama Walmart. The job itself was not hard. What made the overall experience bad was the managers.

Eventually the first manager would come back and wonder why you haven't finished the first task and should have finished it first before beginning another one even after explaining your situation.They will continuously schedule you on days that you have told them again and again that you are unable to work.You're not allowed to request off on holidays and you can't request off from October to February, you are expected to work all of them except Christmas (overnight get Christmas Eve off, and daytime get Christmas Day off).Unfortunately if you don't use your vacation at the end of each year you will lose it, and management won't care and will deny you if their pets (the people who kiss their butts) wants off - more...",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Winchester, VA",11/9/22,2022,11,9

Good place to work but be ready to work hard,"Working at the distribution center and it is not a place to slack off. They do not have ac so it gets extremely hot during summer especially if you’re in a trailer. They will let you take a moment if you’re getting overheated but you will have to get back to work. The managers and head of the warehouse are extremely understanding and nice! They do care about you and Walmart does offer pretty good pay and really good benefits. They are critical of production and do push you beyond your limits. You can and will get write ups for production so be careful. The breaks are very short for the 10-12 hour shift you work, they start at your workstation and end there as well which is inconvenient since they are only one 15 and one 20 minute. There is a lot of growth potential but it is difficult to grow especially if you are exceptional in your position as they don’t want to lose you there. Had a death in the family and had to take a leave of absence for a month to deal with that. They didn’t make me feel bad for it or give me any write ups the process was great and easy in a time I needed that. Their attendance policy is a lot more relaxed than most since other jobs you can get fired for missing one day regardless of if you’re actually sick or have an emergency. They work with you. The work schedule is always the same so there’s no wondering if you have a different shid that week. Plenty of opportunities for overtime and sometimes there is mandatory overtime but it’s not too bad.

"Competitive pay, compensation for physically able people ","I am a current employee of the Walmart Distribution Center in Shepherdsville, KY and have been here for about 6 months now. Although it's a physically exhausting job, it's a great job with benefits and a pay rate that makes the physicality of the job ""do-able"".There is a background check to become employed, but no drug test which is amazing because I am 4-20 friendly. There is no interview, but everything is started on line and you do not go in the facility until you have your orientation.  The start date after orientation depends on your availability and the availability of the trainers,etc. We work 10 hour days four days a week. I currently an what is called back half nights and that is work from 6:00 pm to 4:30 am Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. We get paid  protected time off immediately, and paid time off after 90 days, which is also when the insurance and other benefits kick in. Management is GREAT and HR does more than most companies I've worked for to ensure that all needs are heard and met.The physical aspect of the job is the only thing I'd warn any potential employees about, if you do not do well on physical tasks,don't apply.  Walking to the you'll be stationed at alone is a feat, but it does get easier after a little time.

Fast paced and brutal on the body ,"I loved working there because of its fast paced and had good people. Had a few moments with a team lead who was unrealistic with his expectations when it came to do something. It’s VERY hard on the body so it’s not for the weak. If you apply, make sure you have plenty of stamina and energy to get you through the night. It’s very brutal the first month, once you get used to it then it’s an BIT easier. Finding where the products go will be a challenge. Per pallet of grocery items you should take about 45min stocking it. Lots of drama, stay away from it honestly. Don’t give anyone a ride anywhere and stay to yourself. If you work hard they will notice and will want to move you up in position. I was offered a better position but with the way I saw the manager always overwhelmed with work, I chose not to pursue it. The job is a good fit for you if you like A fast paced environment, don’t mind all the heavy lifting, and the random bruises you might get.

The only answer is more more more,Well working at Walmart I realized that the only thing that the managers and their superiors cared about was themselves and the corporate greed. With hard work and determination you can earn false and robot like word of affirmation that are just constantly muttered to the workers(I appreciateyou). Each night as an overnight stocker was filled with the occasional visit from a manager who's job is to slowly walk around the store and nag those who work below them. Managers would often complain about their personal lives because the only work they had to do was staying later finishing up the overload of work that others weren't able to finish. I believe that the main reason for the miserable working environment at Walmart is due to the closed communication of team leads to managers and their higher ups just barking order down without any compassion or humanity.(though I feel like my statements apply to a large number of team leads and managers there were some who were good hard working people).,2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Middlefield, OH",11/7/22,2022,11,7

Trying to cut hours right before Christmas. We don’t even get a Christmas bonus as an hourly employee but fat managers get a big fat one as they cut hours to save money to make them look good.

Not what it was....,"Honestly thought I would be a lifer at Wal-Mart and didn't mind up until the restructured the management team. I, and so many of my coworkers, lost their positions right after the huge covid wave started to pass. It was basically, thank you for all the extra hours and risk to you and your family but now we are getting rid of your jobs. Not only the restructure but there is no loyalty to those who have been loyal to the company 10 years plus with no instentive with raise in pay to compete with new hires. You see people starting pay at the same as an associate who has been there 15 years. They have eliminated every program that older associates were told they would be Grandfathered into but then not even a full year that was dissipated. They were no checks and balances with what little management there is left and many mistakes are being made in departments that cannot afford to make them. Examples: auto, sporting goods (with firearms and linsence sales), electronics, paint and fabric. All walmarts are being consumed with too much freight that as customers walk into the stores, boxes and trash are still covering the floor not only making it difficult to shop but a safety issue as well. Store are having to spend money to put extra freight in rented cargo trailers but with not enough staff to work the frighte inside them and sales are lost in them. Prices changes are being done without proper process leaving customers upset when ringing up at all the self check outs that the shelf label says one price but the true price (that most likely has gone up) rings up at the register.

I'm not sure how they are doing now, but everything constantly seemed uncoordinated and overwhelmed by confusion. If there was any bright spot to management it would be just a couple of team leads up front, they were very nice and cared for the wellbeing of the people that they were managing. Hardest part of the job was being overwhelmed with the amount of work to do due to the incompetence of others work or the once mentioned before constant confusion going on within the store.

The company focus is on Shareholders not Associates or Customers,"They will keep changing your work hours.  While on medical leave, they changed my work schedule to hours when I could not get day care for my infant.  I had to leave the company after almost seven years.  Health insurance does not pay much.  Salary management treats employees like they own them and all of their time.  Typical to force out associates that have been there longer.  Long term associates do not get a pay increase when new hires are hired on at higher rates.  Managers play favorites when it comes to removing attendance points.  It is very difficult to get salary managers to follow through on things that they are supposed to do for the associates and customers.  Associates that I know at the different stores are all miserable at work.  Walmart keeps cutting hours and benefits in order to be more profitable to shareholders.  It is typical for stores to be behind on freight, off process and unavailable to the customers due to corporate constantly cutting store allotted work hours.  Management will pressure associates into returning from surgeries without taking STD due to high turnover and lack of floor associates.  They do not pay anything extra for working on holidays.  You have to use personal time when they are closed for a holiday and you and paid for the hours.",2,Former Employee,Sales associate up to Assistant Manager ,Various stores in West Virginia,11/4/22,2022,11,4
very bad management,the management is absolutely horrible it almost seems like they want the bad workers too suceed and the hard workers too fail i highly suggest skipping a job offer from this place will ruin your social life and none of your managers help you suceed or they wont trust you at all i worked there for almost 2 years and never got promoted even tho i constantly applied for one and when i got tired of it they fired me as soon as i questioned it,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Cincinnati, OH",11/4/22,2022,11,4
Engaging and well compensated ,"My experience working at Walmart was great.  I found that if you worked hard, stayed focused, showed up on time, and maintained a positive attitude, you were treated accordingly.

"Not the worst, far from the best","Working for this company feels so dystopian. I always showed up to work and had showed up late maybe once in three months, but I was fired because I had accidentally misread the schedule. A simple human error but they will not work with you. They are not understanding about any personal or unexpected things. They don't even accept doctors notes. You're forced to depend on PPTO, which is your paid time off, if you happen to come in late or need to call out. If you do not have enough, they will fire you no matter how long you've stayed with the company. Your department managers and shift leaders are going to be completely inept at their job. If you need their help for any reason, expect them to take their sweet time coming over to you or never showing up at all. Often we would have nights where no manager was on shift and someone was forced into the ""acting"" manager role, which no one is getting paid for. The work can be overwhelming or boring for hours on end, no inbetween. Breaks are often forgotten because the management is so disorganized and there is zero communication. The pay is alright for what it is, and there is a small employee discount. ",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Hixson, TN",11/4/22,2022,11,4
Needs improvement ,They just need to Do better. Managers be moving weird and it’s very drama filled. It’s more of a summer job in my opinion it’s not anywhere I would want to work full time ,3,Former Employee,Team Member ,"Atlanta, GA",11/4/22,2022,11,4
Ok place to work ,"This place is okay to work at. Most of the people are nice but you will find a lot of them have their little groups. I think that is not uncommon at many workplaces though. This store is small and desperately needs some attention for storage and the lawn and garden department needs better protection from the elements. Walmart doesn't seem to care if they lose product because it's being blown all over the parking lot or if their plans are getting burned to the core from the Sun. I can't tell you how many things smell musty from being stored in trailers.Walmart itself leaves some things to be desired. I don't agree with the fact that they took away things from long time employees to offer more pay to newcomers. Although that did include me as a newcomer getting a better pay rate,  they took bonuses from the employees that had been there and were used to getting I think it was quarterly bonuses. I don't feel that was right. Also Walmart does not do any performance reviews with their employees they just decide when everybody deserves to get a raise. So there's really not much incentive for people to do their jobs. People are not trained well.  I feel like that's because older employees that had been there when it was a nice place to work are so tired of all the turnover because people don't stay. They don't stay because they get frustrated because they are not trained correctly or they are snubbed because older employees feel like new hires just going to leave. Unfortunately all this combined is what causes people to leave. ",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Everett, PA",11/4/22,2022,11,4

The new auto assigning system makes it so you usually can’t pick your runs—you could get stuck doing 4 or so oversizes and bringing down your pick rate and further exhausting yourself more than normal trips would.You generally won’t be talking to coworkers much if you are picking. I feel as if the breaks aren’t enough for the amount of work you have to do.

They would reprimand you for things out of your control, such as a product not being available for the customer, the employee would get in trouble for. there was time limits and if you couldn't get it done for one reason or another, you would get in trouble. If customers stepped out in front of you, you had to wait on them and help them if they asked you to, but if it cuts into your time, you're in trouble. If there is a locked up item, you have to wait on the department manager to unlock it because they don't give the keys to the associates working those departments, and if it cuts into your time, you get in trouble (you see the pattern, right?)

Way too demanding for how little pay you get,"I worked there during the pandemic. I would restock beef, go to grab the chicken, and come back and nothing that I just stocked would be there. Then our team lead would yell at me and tell me that I'm ""not working fast enough"" and that ""the shelves need to be full."" The team leads and managers are passive-aggressive.

Management very disappointing don’t work here,Management is terrible and very biased almost out to get you 24/7 no room for even tiny mistakes but others were allowed to do anything.

Productive and fun,Nice nice place to work after transitioning from the Covid experience.Decent pay in the deli and bakery department.  I work with really nice people on the Night Shift.  However my department is a two person show.  We do not get breaks but we do get lunches.  It is very important in the deli and bakery to get along with the people you work with because it’s very minimal.  ,3,Current Employee,Deli Clerk ,"Rincon, GA",11/1/22,2022,11,1
Obsessed with Cases Per Minute,"What sounds like decent work- stocking shelves overnight with no customers in the building- quickly turns into a stressful nightmare after you're thrown into your position with virtually no training and are expected to crank out a case per minute every single night. They'll receive x amount of freight for the night and the geniuses that run the company then expect it to take x amount of minutes to put on the shelf. That means 2,000 pieces should take no more than 2,000 minutes, or a little over 33 hours. Can you squeeze all that into an 8 hour shift with about a dozen workers where you also have to clean, zone, rotate product, verify shelf counts, pull meat and produce trucks, and inventory your overstock? Not usually, but that's the metric by which the position is judged and the big wigs use to give bonuses to your uppers. So you better believe they're cracking that whip on you most of the night.Benefits are quite nice, but you get the same ones working other positions so why grind yourself to the bone on ON? Not worth it!",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Parkersburg, WV",11/1/22,2022,11,1
Easy work,Easy job and good management. I took off a star because older employees would act toxic towards new employees since we were starting at the same pay they took years to reach. Other than that pretty chill. ,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,Kansas,11/1/22,2022,11,1

The warehouse of all time.,"While the training and managers were helpful, the human resources department will make you want to drop the job, they are inflexible and stagnant. The work is brutal during the hotter seasons and the workload fluctuates but never drops below tiring unless the entire warehouse breaks down. Communication is difficult between upper management and employees despite what they say about communication being priority.",4,Former Employee,Shipping Loader ,"Apple Valley, CA",11/1/22,2022,11,1

Its okay,Its easy work the hardest part lets say is just unhooking your trailer but other than that its easy. Worked 5 days 2 days off but in the long run it wasn’t for me.

Be young with no responsibilities and you will go far!,"I was excited to work at my small town Walmart as they claimed to be family and a tight integral part of community.  I was wrong, people shopped there because it was the only full-service store within 30 miles (and one that truth be told, was pretty clean and well stocked and those of us who enjoyed helping and being friendly, more than made up for those that were not).  I adopted a young granddaughter and took care of my semi-able mother so night cashier fit my needs well until Covid took away my position and they moved me to days where I not only lost pay but also hours.  I dealt with it knowing it was a tough time for all, so hung in with the best.  Long story a bit shorter, I got covid the day after Thanksgiving 2020 and proceeded to get my ailing mother sick also.  Our home was full of severe Covid thru the holidays and then mom passed Jan4,2021.  I returned to work almost immediately and to my dismay, no one knew that we were even sick let alone my mother had past.  Very short ending, I was never able to get regular or reasonable hours...when I quit I had gotten an average of 12 hrs a week for months.  I am a hard worker with a fair share of life experience and intelligence yet working for Walmart and never being allowed to move around for cross-training, made it the longest 3 years of my life.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Borger, TX",11/1/22,2022,11,1
Worst company to work for. ,"The positive thing about Walmart is the effort to encourage diversity, but don't expect to be treated the same. I've never worked for a company who visibly targeted people of color, specifically management doing so, and corporate doing NOTHING about it. Management made it obvious who they were trying to get fired/quit, versus who they favored. Be prepared to be threatened through ""coachings"" for taking your 15 minute breaks, for going to lunch, or for using the bathroom. Unless you want to sign your life away to a company that does NOT care about you, do not work for them. ",1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Hamburg, PA",11/1/22,2022,11,1

Secure job but no growth if not open availability ,Wal Mart had a great balance in your life for the max hour week is 40 hours. It was a job if you worked hard felt rewarding and had job security.

Toxic divide between hourly and salary employees; employees are not provided adequate equipment,"There is a clear division between hourly and salary employees. Without being in the management side, I can only assume that there are some performance-based incentives. Some of the salary employees were formerly hourly employees, yet seemed to have ""forgotten their roots."" Management doesn't seem to give a heck. Timeliness, what's that? They wander around and leave hourly employees waiting on their beck and call. I'm not sure how much discretion the store manager/lead has over employee equipment, such as PPE, but there was never enough supplies for employees to do their work in their departments as defined by corporate expectations. As a new employee, you  will complete the safety courses on the computer and in the store itself, much of the required equipment is not available or you are discouraged from using them for sake of ""operational efficiency"" aka they want you to work faster. There are also some ""lifers,"" people who have spent most of their professional life in the store. As a result, their job is their life, so any criticism or feedback you give to them is taken too personally. Some people simply don't know how to do their jobs. This applies to hourly+salary folks. They will stand around on their phones and wait to be given directives. I'm very pro-worker in that you do what you are paid for. But there is also a sense of expected autonomy.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment can easily be described as a disorganized mess. The culture is anyone from older grumps to younger kids in college and everything and everyone in between. What is a typical day like for you at the company?There is no “typical” every day is a new and different day all for the worse. Some new “policy” or the higher ups new gripe of the day. Some manager having a bad day taking a complete power trip on you just because. Grandfathered in associates completely screwing off the whole day leaving the part timers up **** creek without a paddle.,1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Mill Hall, PA",10/29/22,2022,10,29
Great comps for the most part,Very inclusive and diverse company they love their associates and customer! Very customer friendly! The managers And supervisors tend to let power get to their head.

Large variety of duties,"They speak of teamwork and flexibility being important, yet it is not encouraged, unless is to help leads and management, is not shared both ways and associates co-worker equals are not encouraged to help each other out.  Accountability for those doing work effecting next shift doing their work is also a huge issue, making an already stretched thin workload impossible to complete to a good quality, integrity and or corporate standard.  Most full time associate positions require working at least one of the weekend days every week, and doesnt offer weekend shift differential pay. I found that to be problematic as it is an even more challenging working a weekend shift  when there is even less staff on in other areas and end up having to cover those areas too, along with the many other departments am regularly responsible for that i worked in many times on my own. Also, Holiday pay is not even given or any extra pay for holidays, not even for Labor Day for full time employees.  Way to go Walmart for showing your true colors and appreciation for your hard working employees who still show up for work, esp on weekends, holidays with no extra pay, but extra sacrifice is given that takes them away from family time & functions.  Walmart should consider rotating schedules, so associates arent working every Sat. And or Sun. It would be beneficial for Associates to have a better work/life balance such as their bosses/upper management.

Breaks were given at the very last second of the day that they could give them. If you didn't remind your manager about your break you could get fired.

There is no incentive to work here as we have been told that we are “easily replaceable” if we are unable to accomplish a task. Our duties range from day to day, but our lack of employees pushes more work onto the people actually there. Management takes no responsibility and often will fire people with no sympathy.

Toxic management ,"If you don’t reach 100 picks per hour then you will continuously be pulled aside and threatened to be fired. They expect you to get those numbers no matter what even if you get stopped a million times by customers. They tell you that you don’t have to pickup spills because that’s the janitors job but then tell you that it’s your job. Threaten to fire you for taking too long to pick because you’re dealing with customers, spills, etc. the average pick rate was about 65-75 picks per hour hardly any 80s and it’s that way for most warehouses. Unrealistic expectations and they will target people even the hard working employees. Don’t waste your time here. Oh and god forbid you get hurt on the job. They’ll get rid of you over that too.

Front End Associate ,"So I was hired a few months ago as a front end associate. Interview and hiring process went well. Training is easy, than you get your numbers, and you start cashiering by yourself. I haven't been on a register in 10 years, but it's very easy and quick to learn. My day consists of punching in, ask the team lead up front where they want me (cashier, self checkout, running returns) most the time I am on register. I definitely prefer it, because when its busy time flies by super fast. We get an hour lunch when working 8 hours, and two 15 min breaks.I personally think management/team leads lack certain skills. Especially communication. They also play favoritism, which is unfair to all other employees. Overall Walmart is an okay job. The pay is good, having a set schedule (full-time) at least one weekend day off.

Mgmt runs around like chickens without a head,If it's not for the experienced workers nothing in the store would run right mgmt just run around yelling things and half of them don't even make sense or aren't possible to get done. Work is very poorly delegated and if you show your a good worker they give you the tasks of the people who aren't. And job description you sign is a joke. You can be an auto tech who's sole job is to work on cars and get pulled to go push carts out front regardless of how busy or under staffed you are. And when you say something to them they say your job is what ever walmart says it is so you do what we tell you to do. On top of all that at my store we're already short handed and will be scheduled 2 associates for the day then the store Mgr comes out and tell us the shop needs to be spotless or else then the acc Mgr takes so many cars you don't even get time for a break or you won't get home on time.

My time at Walmart ,I worked there for less then a month like I had 5 days more to me a month and I never got paid. When I contacted someone about it no one cared to even get back to me about it. One thing I really disliked while working there is that I had 3 team leads in my department on at once during all the days I worked. They didn’t train me. One team lead would tell me how to do something and then another one would yell at me because I was doing it wrong. One the team coach would tell me something and then I would follow his stuff because he’s above the team leads but the team leads would yell at me. Just not a good work environment.

Safety is becoming a major issue unaddressed.

Alright place to work,"    Walmart has some really good foundational principles of how they want to outline the company and its relationships with its workers. I think where its lost for me, and you should only really pay attention to this if you plan to work there for a longer period, is that it feels hollow. Yes management will talk this game of being inclusive and understanding, but the reason why they are saying all those nice things is because the company wants them to. They don't mean those things for the most part. At the end of the day Walmart is a large company, and you are a very small dispensable piece of it. They put up a very good act of trying to make everyone feel important, but at the end of the day is only supposed to make you feel comfortable and as the popular clause states within the contract multiple times ""Walmart has the right to end anyone's employment at any time for any/no reason."" Walmart is a better burner job compared to other companies, but at the end of the day it is what it is for the majority- a burner job.",3,Former Employee,Digital Shopper ,"Springdale, AR",10/21/22,2022,10,21

I had zero in-person training, and never even met my direct manager for the entire 8 months I worked there. The store is always filthy and trying to keep up with maintenance tasks is impossible due to low employment rates and people not doing their jobs in a respectful or appropriate manner. You will spend 80% of your shift cleaning up after other employees, and the other 20% cleaning up biohazard situations without proper training. I worked in maintenance for 4 years before working at Walmart, which was the only reason I was able to handle these situations. The job is made even more difficult due to consistently running out of supplies (Toilet paper, chemicals, paper towels, etc) or equipment breaking (IE no air conditioning for over a month in summer, broken brooms, mops, clogged pipes). This is not a job I would recommend to anyone for the long term. However, some of my coworkers were very sweet and lovely to be around.

Great Advancement Opportunities ,"I only worked for about 3 months as an overnight stocker. I would have appreciated more of an introduction to staff when I first started. There is not a lot of socialization among employees which made it hard to ask questions and feel comfortable. They seem to be lagging behind on available technology to increase efficiency, but I could see that had become a primary focus. As a store manager you can make at a minimum $130,000 annually (inclusivd of bonuses). It's a very well kept secret. Sometimes it felt a little too top (mid level manager) heavy.  I might be told to work on something by one manager and then told the opposite by another manager. ",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Overland Park, KS",10/20/22,2022,10,20

Misunderstanding to Success,"Walmart portrays an image of opportunity and profit. One of those is correct. Its an opportunity to profit off of those who think there is opportunity there. Working there is doing 4 jobs in 1. Often working jobs of someone higher up and receiving half the credit. Thats if youre lucky. Complain and youre a trouble maker. Ask about workplace issues and get two responses. 1. Why are you complaining or 2 just get ignored. Why either response? The audacity of you questioning your walmart overlords. Thats just management.

Management and Pay,Base pay begins at $12 for most of the store. You will not be receiving a pay raise no matter how hard you work. The benefits are pretty good with the stock purchase plan and 401k match. Biggest issue is management is not there to help you grow. If you bend over backwards for them they'll cheer you on. You ask if they'll help you grow and they'll say you're just wanting to be handed a position or raise.

They are ALWAYS changing something and it is overwhelming keeping up with all the changes. Stick to a plan and keep it moving. I've never worked for a company who cares less for the actual hourly employees and focuses more in their management. Give back to your employees. Give them incentive again and a reason to want to stay with the company. No one should be in complete fear of getting sick and wondering if they are going to lose their because of it.

Walmart is a great place to work at but it’s all about which store and department you are in ,I don’t think working at Walmart is a terrible job I personally believe it’s about which department you work in at which store you work at every since Walmart decided to make everything basically self check I hated working at the front the front end associates are treated poorly self check is to help assist people and watch so if everything is done why does it matter if they are just standing there why do we have to stand in the middle we are in everyone’s way this store self check is to small to stand in the middle being a hard worker is not appreciated instead you will get used I don’t go above and beyond for this company anymore because why should I when someone else can come in and slack off all of the time this store has favoritism some of the managers at the front have attitudes for no reason and should not be managers this store has terrible organizational skills I worked at the store in Gilmer tx and loved it working in mount pleasant made me hate working for Walmart when I first got there they didn’t show me where the break room was they didn’t even show me where to get water at I had to figure it out on my own as a front end associate this one man and lady at my job smelled so bad and they wouldn’t do anything about it I couldn’t take it anymore so I had to switch departments the only thing that I hate about working for Walmart is the point system you can only have 5 points before termination and it takes 6 months for each day you call off key word just one point to fall off yes we get pto and ppto but it takes forever to get the point system is not in favor for people - more...,4,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Mount Pleasant, TX",10/19/22,2022,10,19
Good job all around,Enjoyed the job all in all. I started working here about a week after I graduated high school and loved working here. I learned very fast and quickly became the best I could.

Underpaid/overworked,If you aren’t the manager’s favorite they will make you work as much as possible and look over your shoulder whenever they get a chance while their favorite associates get to talk and goof around whenever they want.

Work ,"It is a good place to work but if you have the opportunity to move up, do it.  You are constantly on your feet. The pay is not bad. You can feel very overwhelmed and stressed because of the pressure that you are given by upper management and all the expectations that are sometimes impossible to achieve in a short time.

Fast Paced. Good co workers and management. Not worth the pay.,"The job itself is easy your just scanning items the whole day. Occasionally they will throw you to do other stuff but they’re equally as easy. The management was very nice and not strict at all. The other cashiers were also very fun to be around. Only downside is you’ll still have to deal with rude customers, which is inevitable, regardless of how nice you are to them. And the pay in my opinion isn’t worth it especially if your working weekends and everyday night around 7-10pm. The store gets so packed you’ll be ringing up customers for 3 hours straight at times. Overall it was an easy and fun job but you can probably find jobs just as easy for better pay.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Perris, CA",10/18/22,2022,10,18

So, u better be ready with some wet wipes to wipe the brown stuff off your nose. Another thing is they always say oh were shorthanded we don't have enough people. Well, it's because they fire people constantly for the dumbest reasons.

Bad,"Management has favorites, not because they worked there longer but because the things employees will do that is completely against company policy and get away with, whereas a slight change of how to do my job because I am alone and they don’t put 2 employees together so that the workload isn’t a lot, they proceed to make employees work alone, then question why their position isn’t being succeeded. I am outside as a CartPusher. We have this machine called the MULE. We put carts on this machine to make it faster instead of using our hands then we have a remote that assists in driving the MULE up the road towards the bay, and then sticking them inside the store. There were days that the temperature hit 3 digits and it would be extremely hot. I took breaks frequently, and after my breaks my managers would scold me for leaving the bay empty! We had a paper posted on the wall that stated it is mandatory to take breaks as much as necessary. We were provided straps that were very useless making it extremely difficult to push the carts because they would bend and smack into cars or into the cart corrals ",1,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Tucson, AZ",10/18/22,2022,10,18

"Great pay, decent job. Unreliable hours and management.","I worked as a online grocery personal shopper, and I loved the job itself. I got pretty comfortable with the way things work after about a couple weeks. Coworkers were alright too. The issue that lead me to quit after 2 months of employment was the hours. I was supposed to be part time, as I was going to school. 15-25 hours was what I expected. Instead, I was scheduled for an average of 30-40 hours a week. I repeatedly brought up the issue, but nothing stuck. I ended up quitting because I couldn’t keep up with the hours and do my school work. I usually was only home to sleep.

My position was making the least $ per hour in the store because I wasn't a ""stocker"" even though I stocked my area everyday. Management refused to hire more people for my position for whatever reason, meaning there was only about 4 associates to complete all of our shift's tasks (usually only 2 or less of us each day). My team lead had unrealistic expectations for my coworkers and I, and she was always very negative and rude to any other associates that weren't directly under her. The company has a very strict and confusing attendance policy. Training was terrible, there were many things I was trained on months into working there that I should have been told week one.

Store needs a management overhaul.,"The majority of the associates at this store are a pleasure to work with.  They are friendly, funny, know their job and how to take care of the customers.  I was a TA2 Stocker 3pm-12am.  This store is off the hook busy from 4pm-9pm!  Way too busy to have 12-15 stockers working with ladder carts on the aisles, a pallet at the end of each aisle, 6-7 pallets of water on the floor. And a crew of in-store shoppers taking the product off of the shelf that I just stocked!!!   Management plays favoritism on who gets promoted.  There is no training for new hires!  Stockers put items in the wrong spot/wrong price, Team Lead just wants the freight put up fast!  Unrealistic time frame to work a pallet of freight.  The majority of freight coming in everyday are no-location (new Items) that you can't stock and product that's already full.  Forget about stocking anything anywhere near the front checkouts!  The checkout lines are out of site!  Management will get on the register if the District Supervisor is there, or on the weekend maybe.  I didn't know who the store manger was for the first 2 mths I worked there.  The team leads treat you like a kid and talk down to you!  This store needs new management!",2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Norfolk, VA",10/17/22,2022,10,17

Pretty easy job but management is the main issue,"I worked at Walmart for about year as a Frozen/Dairy Associate. I was immediately put to work right after my orientation for about 8 hours and then I worked for 5 days straight after that. It wasn't that many hours but it did help me get used to the workplace since this was my first job ever. I was defiantly lost on what to do for about three days until I was randomly put into the dairy fridge and I became frozen/dairy associate. After that, my supervisor quit their job and later on I was working by myself without anyone else help for about 1-2 months. It was hard to get any help from the managers, and I barely remembered their names. We didn't even have a clipboard or something to tell us what needs to be worked on. I know that it is usually like this at most places but when there is basically zero communication between managers or team leads it can get frustrating.",3,Former Employee,Frozen/Dairy Associate ,"Marana, AZ",10/17/22,2022,10,17

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The management (not all but most.) They will tell you that you must get a large number of tasks done before you go home but that you can't work overtime. Also one manager will pull you from one department to another and then you will get yelled at by your department manager for not being there. My job was enjoyable but sometimes very hard. I suffered many injuries at Walmart ranging from carpal tunnel and cuts to splinters from pallets and a broken rib. Had to lift very heavy boxes by myself each day because there was no one to assist. Lazy people get preferential treatment and promotions while hard workers get overworked and verbally abused. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The coworkers on my level were so awesome. Some of the managers were awesome and did not like the unfair hierarchy. Each store is a little different and unique. Safety was not so good in my store but it was very clean and sanitary.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Clock in and get right to work cleaning up the mess left by previous shift. Sometimes there would be a group meeting depending on who was in charge. Tasks were written on the board and also verbal.  Very fast paced stocking that was constantly interrupted by customers.

"Favoritism, unempathetic management and constant policy changes.","Management practices favoritism. Specific management are toxic and deliberately single out and bully certain employees. They have ZERO compassion. They're unappreciative to certain employees and they will turn a blind eye to their favorites. I worked there for 3 months several years ago and witnessed this with my own two eyes before I finally had enough, and quit. I saw, first hand how horribly they treated an employee that they just didn't like. One manager would tell that person to do something a certain way, and another manager would tell them they were doing it wrong. In the end, the only one getting reprimanded was the employee. Finally, no matter how hard the employee tried to improve, they would still find other reasons to reprimand or discredit the worker.The bottom line is, Walmart is a good place to work, however, corporate needs to do a complete overhaul of this specific store because it really is THAT bad! Walmart as a company has lots of nice perks, and other stores have awesome management and treat all the employees with respect, however the work environment here, is really bad and this is why they have a large turnover.

It's an eh company,Walmart isn't a bad place to work. But you have a point system which is kind of ridiculous. You want to judge people on attendance all the time? Especially if they are sick. You only get 4 points and if you go over that within your first 6 months you get fired. It almost seems like you are better off doing fast food cause you get paid more and better advancement opportunities. I've got almost 9 years of management experience under my belt and they were talking about making me a team lead cause I've been doing so well but nope that was a big fat lie. Coaches are very disrespectful especially the front-end one. If you don't put in time off requests within a month then you won't get it and if you call in then you will get point. I'm even considering of going back to fast food cause at least I'll get the time off. Especially around Christmas time due to my family being all the way in the other side of Iowa.

Some coaches are understanding when you cannot meet crazy expectations and others react very poorly. You often feel like if you speak up you’ll be put in places you don’t enjoy. Every shift hates the other shift. However, there are good coworkers, some team leads are understanding, and it is consistent work.

"Great people, good management and bad customers!!","BRACE YOURSELF, this review is a doozy!!I’ve been working here for almost 2 and a half years and I’ve met really great fellow associates and some members of management. There are some that would get power over their head and be on a power trip for a week or two, and we do lose a lot of great and hard working associates and members of management unfortunately. But yet there are the good apples, most coaches and team leads don’t let power get over their heads and are really helpful and encouraging, even if they’re not in charge of your department or a part of this side of the store. I do feel like there is room for some improvement, but overall I do love my coach and team leads.One thing I don’t recommend is high school students to work here during school semester, based from my experience. It does get busy and even if they schedule short hours, it will be hard to keep up both school and work. I do recommend working here during the summer if you’re looking for summer work. I would say it does get really during summer and winter time, but the hours are good.Lastly, it’s mainly the customers that ruins the experience. Always the customers that ruins at least 85% of my experience. Mistreatment from them is so normalized, some actually make large messes intentionally to “keep the labor going” (an actual quote). So many times I’ve been called names because we didn’t have the product in stock when they’re in the store. Or that a product has a required age limit and they didn’t have an ID.

I didn't appreciate how the managers would move me sometimes to cover departments I wasn't familiar with. Customers could be a challenge as many see you as beneath them. During slow times, I had to beg for hours and would work some hours in produce which I didn't mind. I don't like how they rely on floor/dept staff to help cashier ...it would leave depts empty.

Terrible place to work if you actually like working.,"The customers vary of course like any other job but the management is terrible. I've worked at two separate Walmarts and management was awful in both. Neither one trained me to do my job, I just had to figure it out as I went. I had managers who just straight up didn't like me, some flirted with me, and some just liked to make me do their jobs for them.

Stressful workplace with managers constantly hounding employees. Otherwise it's not too bad.,"Most days at work are not too bad if no managers are around to pester you during your shift, however, if there are managers there is usually a feeling of unease and stress. The management tend to put stress on you without knowing it themselves, not once did they ever stop to ask what our daily routine was like to see how we could improve or change. The workplace itself was actually the best part, everyone was very laid back and friendly and understanding of your daily woes about the workplace. The hardest part of the job was trying to adjust to the managers version of a daily routine when they were around, they gave tasks that were impossible to accomplish within the allotted timeframe and stressed everyone working that day out. The other best part about the job besides the awesome co-workers were the customers gratitude, many were very polite and even bothered to learn our names and address us respectfully, they even brought up fun conversation from time to time.",4,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,951 Resler Dr,10/11/22,2022,10,11

Which I don’t believe is worth it. The company use to give annual bonuses of up to $1,300 but that’s based on sales but that’s gone.

Worst company and work environment I've ever encountered.,"This job has been short of nothing but terrible. From being cussed out by customers and having people throw their crumpled receipts in my face, to being completely ignored by management and treated like a work mule for pennies... I have never seen a store or company so dysfunctional at the ground level as I have seen with Walmart. I've worked a variety of stores - pet stores, clothing stores, specialty outdoors stores - and none of them had even a smidgen of the problems I've seen and had at this place. Departments don't communicate, there's no sense of ""team"" and you're constantly having to struggle against other departments. There is no mental stimulation to the Customer Host position - you stand and greet customers, who often times cuss you out because there's no shopping carts and you can't leave the door to fetch them one. There also is no possibility of changing departments for 6+ months, and advancement opportunities are severely limited. The management in the front-end likes to use hosts to cover their cashiers, yet do not like to have their cashiers provide hosts coverage for their breaks. The front-end also likes to dump nightly returns on hosts after the store is closed, which their own associates shop and ditch carts of returns in random departments. There is no teamwork between departments - and hosts have been tasked recently with maintaining organization of the clearance aisle -- to which can be an absolute nightmare since other employees have a tendency to just shove products onto the shelves without following the guidelines. All in all, being a customer host - more...",1,Current Employee,Asset Protection Customer Host ,"Fayetteville, NC",10/11/22,2022,10,11

Depends on Who You’re Working With,"I was a former cashier and self checkout host when I had worked for Walmart. Things have changed since I had quit working there as I still am friends with some of my former coworkers. It’s a good job to work at for the first 6-ish months and if you’re in high school still. If you’re still working there after graduating high school and see your former classmates go through your line to buy stuff to go off to college, it feels a bit discouraging. On another note, Walmart didn’t care that some of the older men working there creeped on the younger women working there (Older men in their 80s, women in early 20s), and one of the creepy men had gotten employee of the month even though he creeped on my friends and I.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Self-Checkout Host ,"Elk River, MN",10/11/22,2022,10,11

Also they make you do 3-4 peoples jobs as one person which can get quite hectic. It was also hard to achieve the right equipment to improve job efficiency which really affected my work attitude . 10/10 would work here again if wages were improved and hard work was rewarded in some positive way!,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,1806 fort Jones rd,10/10/22,2022,10,10

No compassion for employees with disabilities, and this location is against having anyone work at the location with disabilities. I have seen with my own eyes the mistreatment of special needs employees.  The store is a mess and only a panic clean up just before upper management shows up.

"I had a terrible experience, managers were not fair  ","If you can find a job that isn’t Walmart, go there. The only time I would recommend working at Walmart, is if you hate you’re own life, or if you personally know a manager. You do not want to be a base associate, you get dawged on constantly. You’re only goal should be to move up in the company, and that’s why I say work there if you know a manager. They do not care about hard workers, it is all about who you know.

Unpleasant environment,"Requested for unpaid time of around a month in a half in advanced for surgery. When the time came for my surgery I didn’t receive acknowledgment for the time needed off. I had to call out 3-4 days in a row for time off I requested far in advanced. When I sent the doctors note they refused to accept it. The environment in which your in is based on favoritism. Team leads will bombard you with requests that need to be done in the store and just stand around and talk to other coworkers for 30min or more at a time. When you stop to talk to a coworker for less than 5 min or even a customer they will scold you. It doesn’t matter how well or efficiently you do your job, the treatment you get will stay the same. They pick on you for talking to customers or coworkers but won’t pay mine to coworkers that take 30min-1hr breaks leaving you on the floor to do everything. To say the least I had to quit due to the hours I had to call out for before being fired. So I’d say this is a very unpleasant job/company to work for especially with the pay rate.

terrible management with no solutions for problems ,Often would be left without a supervisor for the second half of my shift which is also when everything fell apart (shocking). Was explicitly told that work comes before personal life in regards to our meeting when lots of people requested a weekend off. Never was told we were appreciated when we kept going when everything was going wrong just that our numbers are bad. Absolutely no coverage for breaks if you're doing anything other than picking orders which always meant it was going to be a disaster when you came back to overdue orders and angry customers. Not a bad job if you do the bare minimum and keep to yourself. This way they don't expect anything from you. Don't show them a glimpse of your other abilities bc they will pile loads of work on you meant for a group of 4.

As a 36-year old Military Veteran, former construction worker, home remodeler, and heavy equipment operator, this position I knew would be the best fit for me.When I started out, the Seasonal Department consisting of Garden Center, Toys, and the Seasonal area, was fully staffed. We had 5-8 people not including a Team Lead and Coach. Our shifts nicely rotated and we got our work done across the departments we owned. There were some rough days, but we got it done. Since December 2021, we no longer had anyone in Garden Center other than me. I was the only associate that would stay in GC with the rest of our people becoming zoners ( people who just straighten up the aisles ). Instead of manning departments like GC, Sporting Goods, and Hardware with people who worked there everyday and kinda knew what was going on, they do this “Team” stuff; where everyone is all over the store, helping every department and largely just zoning and putting up returns.I quit along with another military veteran that served in Iraq in the early 2000’s Oct. 05, 2022. There are now 3 people left on the GM side of the store for evening shifts, all of which are about to quit as well. One of them is another veteran.

The associate that speaks out gets retaliated against and no one cares. ",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Las Vegas, NM",10/7/22,2022,10,7
Very competitive or favoritism is played. ,"I switched from 4th to 2nd and it’s very discombobulated. Lots of favoritism is plays a part into it. Love the people, love my co workers. When I was on 4th you either make production or get fired. On 2nd I’ve seen if you don’t make it they move you to easy positions that multiple people were interested in, and asked for. I was interested in multiple positions, have experience in these positions and seen people who never hit the production numbers get the position. I’ve seen lots of favoritism. I’ve watched integrity.  Love Walmart but hate the way it’s getting. Hired more people but will not give anyone 40+ hours right now. Let’s say they drop 53,000 and they say we’re not having another drop then next thing you know it you got 4-3 hours left of shift and they make another drop making it hard and can’t finish the work load then the managers will get mad at you but you can’t stay to help because if you get 40+ hours on your time right now you’ll get an occurrence. Employees don’t respect management which stresses them out and they take it out on you later. Management needs to be taken more seriously. Employees will put time in and just leave without telling any type of management. I find that very hard and disrespectful to the other associates and management.

There are managers that do their best to support you and listen really great leaders however they are not listened to by main manager who will do things their way anyway. upper management and corporate have unrealistic expectations causing your direct managers to rush you, but then managers will hide tools needed and that they should supply, so you spend way too much time trying to find the equipment you need, causing anxiety and low morale. nothing was ever good enough, you feel like your job is constantly on the line.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Atlanta, GA",10/6/22,2022,10,6

To me, it is a fun job, I cannot deny that. Being able to go around the store and get items off the shelves can be turned into some kind of game if you have the right mindset. I always challenge myself to get the products as quickly and efficiently as I can.

We don't have a manager.  (volunteer, or paid) And so far, i have not met anyone from management.  I doubt they know my name, as I do not have a vest or name badge.

I loved being a personal shopper at Walmart,"The Pay was great! I liked the people I worked with, they were hard-working, dedicated folks.

Dead end job with no advancement ,If you're looking for a boring busy job with no advancement then this is the job for you. I started out overnight stocking and have met some cool decent managers but it's a lot of favoritism here. It took almost 4 years just to be a department manager here while others got promoted right away. Then they downsized on managers so I didn't have that job for too long. However I miss working here. The management always chases good workers away.,5,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Roseville, MI",10/5/22,2022,10,5
Poor Management & Scheduling ,"Worked Electronics/Photo Lab for 2 years as part time (34 or less hrs) but I had to work full time hours and none of the benefits of full time. We were always short staffed because they never scheduled enough employees to work each  day. For instance, the electronics dept is supposed to have 2 employees at all times due to the type of merchandise and the risk of theft of said things. Yet on most given days, only one person is scheduled and its impossible for one to perform all job duties and watch over the merchandise. I went several weeks without a day off, not only that but I also went 6 months without getting a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday off even after requesting one a month or two in advance. The poor scheduling and not being able to switch schedules is the main reason I no longer work there. Loved all my coworkers but the management was absolutely terrible!!! It’s all about who you’re friends with and not how well you perform your job. I can ask any Walmart employee I previously worked with how things are now and they’ll tell me things are worse than ever now.

Absolute joke of a company ,Walmart and it’s lighter ups do not care one bit about they’re employees they micro manage and are never there when you need them. When you can get ahold of someone and voice you’re concerns they either ignore you or say they’ll do something about it and never do. Only benefit to the job is the pay is tolerable compared to other places but it is not at all worth it. I worked there for 3 years never got any of the training I asked for and have never gotten a raise for being there so long.

Didn’t feel appreciated.,"It was convenient to work remotely with this company. It allowed me to still be there for my child during the day. The job itself, being customer service, was not the best. You mostly get calls of complaints and angry customers so it takes a toll on you and it’s stressful dealing with them all day. I think the management is pretty great. They’re kind and helpful when you reach out. My biggest issue is the lack of work/life balance. I had notified my supervisor about medical issues I’ve been dealing with since the beginning of this year. This has caused me to visit the doctors on multiple occasions during the month. I try to get those days off or at least complete it during my lunch break but would sometimes be later than expected or something would come up. There is no excuse for missing work or being tardy in their eyes. Even if I provide doctors notes and proof of hospitalization it still counted against me and I was fired. It made me feel disposable and that what I was going through did not matter to them. I didn’t ask to have medical issues and I tried to do the best I could to work around my schedule which was Monday-Friday. No doctors office is open weekends. It was just shocking to me how blunt they were about firing me. They didn’t even let me finish the shift that day. Sad to see they don’t care about what their employees are going through in their personal lives.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,Remote,10/5/22,2022,10,5

Worst place ever,"They treat the employees like carp. Always change schedules with out notice, even when they know you can't work surtan days or times they will schedule you to work and not care. The managers don't care that you have a life and kids they want you to do what benefits them and thier areas.They constantly talk down to you like your incompadent or a child that's done something wrong. They don't train you how to do your job properly, so when things are not done the way the want they get mad even if you fallowed paperwork saying how to do it. They don't work with schedules like they say they do. They don't have a reasonable time off request for parents that have to have days off or need holidays off because of no daycare and no school. Wal-Mart is all about the money not the employees or customers. They will cut hours, then tell you it's only that week and keep cutting hours for weeks and months at a time. Full time employees are working part time hours. And part time people are hardly getting 10 hours a week of that. They make you work other jobs that get paid $2plus dollars more than your spot does, for days and weeks at a time and if you ask for the pay of those jobs while you are doing it they get mad that your not just doing it. They are all about saving themself monet and treating employees and customers like carp.",1,Current Employee,Personal shopper ,"Payson, UT",10/5/22,2022,10,5

While working there I was ALWAYS overworked and put into full time hour shifts despite being a part time worker and a student at the time, I never had time to be able to work on my high school career which was my priority at the time.

Good but…..,"So, I worked for Walmart for a year and a month and a half. I loved my job. I was good at what I did, worked remotely and was able to care for my child while working. Until, they started making rapid changes to “policy” and attendance. It quickly became very unclear as to how attendance worked and I was terminated for a “no call no show” when I was two hours late in due to a power outage and unable to reach anyone. They still hit me with that. Outrageously unfair. Unsure if I would work for this company again due to the lack of empathy and understanding as well as extremely unorganized as far as their policies.

Short staffed so you have to work even harder. ,"This is a company that looks at labor as a cost. They keep a skeleton crew and that forces people to work themselves to death in order to get their stocking aisle done for the night.

Walmart Ethics,"Working at walmart is one of the worst decisions I could have made in life job wise. The location that I was working at is very unorganized and filled with dishonestly. I have seen/ heard a lot of things that shouldn’t not have been seen or heard. Associates should feel comfortable talking to managers when a problem occurs, but instead it’s safer to keep it to your self because they will not help you.

Wal-mart is an Equal Opportunity employer allowing people to be themselves, find work friends that become work family and allows one to move areas either to find their niche or learn things for advancement.

Your co workers can also be great to be around depending on your location. The job can get boring and repetitive which is why I say it’s a good starter job but you may not be happy to stay there long.The only con I have is scheduling can be a nightmare.

"Pays Well, Work Employees great butttt….","I got hired as a CPHT a year ago. The pay is shockingly better than all other retail pharmacies. The job itself isn’t to difficult but like most retail places they want you to do more than you should in my opinion. Constantly feels like they add more and more task to your overall job and it can be stressful. Pharmacist only seem to chip in when your short handed. I feel like they could easily do more to make workload a lot more manageable. Idk if every store is the same but that’s how it feels at this one. When we have floaters they help clear resolution and share responsibility with doctor calls. Which we can have well over 50+ in a day and it’s hard when you are 1 person inputting, resolution, attending to drop off and so on. If everyone did equal amount of work and shared workload as a whole it would be a lot easier.The worst part of this location is the people. Don’t get me wrong you have good people, people you actually enjoy seeing but overall most the people are rude and inconsiderate. That’s 100% based on this location. I worked other stores and the customers were much more nicer etc. If you go for a position here in pharmacy great, overall it’s not terrible just cooperate bs and lack of a smooth workflow at times. I just recommend highly stay away from ghetto locations and your job will be highly enjoyable. Drive the extra time to work at a better store like Exton, even Boothwyn but some of those places don’t have the best pharmacist.

Great place to grow,"Walmart is a great place to go if you really don't know what you want to do in life and need to get on your feet. I started less than a year ago when I was in high school and have grown more as a person from working here than I ever did in school. They're also super flexible with your schedule as long as you communicate, and as long as you learn from your mistakes your job is pretty secure. I've met a lot of great people, customers, coworkers, and managers alike, and feel like it's a place I genuinely fit in. They also pay well compared to other jobs in the area and have a free college program. Accepting the job here was definetely my smartest decision this past year.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Fountain, CO",10/3/22,2022,10,3

If you enjoy a fast paced and stressful job then Walmart is the place for you.,"On truck day, everyone is given a zone. They are responsible for pulling those items off the line and putting them on the appropriate pallet. It usually takes about three hours to finish unloading a truck. After that is done, your team lead(s) give you your next assignment. No matter what it is and no matter how long you've been there, it is expected of you to have it finished in a certain time. What I've learned from this job is that you are expected to learn everything on your own. The only training you receive will be from watching videos. They'll tell you that we're a team and that the team does everything together. But if you're having trouble keeping up and a so-called teammate has to step in and help you, you'll hear about how you're intentionally being slow so that someone will do your job for you. Sounds like such a great team right? Management doesn't care. Your team lead(s), coach and even your coworkers don't care. The only thing they are concerned about is when they get to go home. They'll run over the top of someone to get everything done. There are many jobs within the position that you're expected to learn. Two occasions that come to mind is when it was my first time doing two different jobs. Both times, I was told that I wasn't fast enough. For me, the hardest part of the job is fighting the urge to walk out. I want to like working there because the pay is decent, you get a free Walmart+ membership and they'll pay for your college if you decide to go. I've broke down a few times because I felt like I was being set up to fail. You have to ask yourself if a few - more...",3,Current Employee,Stocker ,Kentucky,10/2/22,2022,10,2

We are a team, and if you can’t rely on your team members, those who do actually come into work struggle and get frustrated. Not to mention the waste of payroll and not being able to hire someone to take the slackers place because they skirt around getting fired. WE NEED RELIABLE PEOPLE!!

Never enough people to do the work, but management wasn't hiring more. The backroom was constantly packed with stock, even blocking the emergency exits at some points, but we were told not to tell upper management.

The regular workers are pretty chill most of the time, because you know, they're regular people, but the management is just awful, because you know exactly the type of person it takes to be a manager for a soulless company like this.

"Not a difficult job, just stressful","I have worked at Walmart for several years and as of 2022, there has been absolutely no incenitives to want to do better. What do I mean? Well, basically Walmart had several incentives for employees who wanted to do their job better. And get paid better for it.Years ago, they offered something called ""Sunday Premium."" Which meant, if you worked on Sunday, you would get an extra $1 an hour. Pretty good incentive, right? Then they took that away.Next, they had something called ""VPI."" Which stood for ""volume-producing item."" Basically you would pick an item and keep that stocked more on a regular basis for that entire month. And if it sold well that month, compaired to the previous year, you would gain points. So the person with the most points at the end of the month, would get $50 on their paycheck. Awesome incentive. And then second place would get $25, then third would get $10. So basically you were given an incentive to want to keep the shelves better stocked for customers.Then they got rid of that. And finally, were the quarterly bonuses. Which were called, ""MyShare."" Essentially if your store sold well, you would get anywhere from $150 to $400 bonus on your check at the end of the quarter. Another incentive to want to do better. And they took that away.So, what is the point of working at a place where there are absolutely zero incentives to want to do better? There isn't any.

"Fsst Paced and Challenging, Can be easy to build a career but must sacrifice for it","If you are willing to put in the time, sacrifice your time off, take on continuously more responsibility  and stretch projects it can be very easy to build a career at Walmart. Less than a year to Team Lead, another year to Coach, 2 more to be a Store Lead and 2 more for a SM. So all in all Average time is 6 to 10 year to grow a Store Manager. If you work for Walmart and haven't been promoted in those timelines, you should probably self reflect or understand that you are not willing to make the sacrifices required to move up, think about every time you said no, your manager probably remembers. Worklife balance for Managers is Terrible especially Salaried Store Managers, Always on Call and when you lose a manager you have to cover their areas. In TL's Average $21/hr, Coach Starts at 50K, Store Lead Starts at $70K. Store Managers make around $100,000 per year base and can bonus 125% of that if they are perfect on metrics. It is not unheard of for a tenured SM to Make $250,000.

Consistent work pace and easygoing atmosphere until it isn't.,"My job was as an overnight stocker. I unpackaged freight, stocked then organized merchandise and cleaned up the cardboard and plastic. The job was fairly easy labor wise. Most everyone was polite enough if not outright friendly. Two fifteen minute breaks and an hour lunch provided a nice flow to the work load. The pay was very decent for my area, and the required work, which made the benefits stand out more than they otherwise might. That's it for the good. The bad is fairly minimal but was enough to make it feel like the wrong place for me. The training was poor. Part of orientation was completing a required list of short lessons on the computer and you must finish all of them, even when your shifts start, before starting work. The lessons may be fairly short but there were about one hundred thirty or more. They covered a lot of information, some of which had nothing to do with my position, and in there abundance, as well as rapid completion that was not supplemented with physical experience, I retained very little of the information. It is such a slog to take seriously that near as I could tell almost no one does and they simply try to complete it as fast as they can by clicking away at the multiple choice answers until they finish it. When my shift started I was not taught about everything my job would cover, only the immediate task at hand. This portion was not so poor, communication was fine. Whether from management or fellow associates information was provided clearly. It was the thoroughness that left something to be desired. Because of this early on my work pace slowed. - more...",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Redmond, OR",9/30/22,2022,9,30

Bad place to work. You will be treated poorly ,This job is very draining and the more you do to help them the more that will be asked of you. They push their employees around.

The absolute worst place to work,"i am a former employee and i was with the company for 7 months, looking forward to more than a year to work for the company. i remember i used to enjoy getting up and getting ready for work there but it was soon to change due to the weak management, the feeling of putting so much hard work and dedication to benefit the company and team that i was on but apparently it wasn’t enough for them to help move good the strong, motivated, enthusiastic, etc employees the company does have working for them in a position to move up in the company. it seems as if they only want to keep who they have that are in the upper management positions in their positions and do not want anyone who actually would and want to help benefit the company because if you’ve worked at the walmart in North Olmsted, Ohio on brookpark road you know that all supervisors “team leads/coaches” walk around the store get into conversations that have nothing to do with the task at work for the day and look for reasons to pull someone into the office to write up or terminate an employee. lastly the best way to describe this walmart is if you could imagine grown women/men in their 30’s-40’s that act like they’re teenagers with all of the gossip and hold grudges towards actual teenagers or ones in their 20’s like myself that work their hardest for the company when we are the ones doing all the work for the “team leads/coaches” to take all the credit for even though they put absolutely no effort or pride into their work but to over rush productivity when they are the ones that do absolutely nothing but the simplest things - more...",1,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"North Olmsted, OH",9/29/22,2022,9,29

Truth,Walmart is middlesboro is very much known for only moving up in exchange for 18+ behaviors. Happened very recently. There's nothing to work for. You do what they want and they will give you any and every reason to make your stay where your at. You will get teamleads who appreciate the extra work but that's it. Management and up does not care and will not care about you. As long as they get there bonus they will gladly cut the stores hours. We run out of supplies all the time.

If you make a decent salary YOU WILL be stressed out often.

"Taken advantage of, pulled to do things outside your work.","In my time as a self-checkout host, I've had to do so much things at my job, and some of those weren't even my rsponsibilities. On top of keeping watch over self-checkout area, I also had to; push carts every day, bring return items to customer service and sort them out, bring freezer items back to shelves as well as various other items, clean off the machines and dust the area around self-checkout, and help customers with their purchases. The main problem with this was that I clocked in at 12 noon, and was sent to immediately work out a lot of things that were wrong, despite having various other hosts/hostess around. In fact, rarely if ever, female cashiers/hostess would never be sent to push carts or sort items in customer service. They got off easy. A lot of my female coworkers spent the majority of their shifts talking to each other in corners of the checkout area while male associates, like myself, were heavily scrutinized when it came to socializing. No matter how much you did at this job, it was never enough. I put a lot of effort to listen to management feedback and I believe that I did everything I was told but yet they always wanted more from me. I didn't see this with my other coworkers, even males, it was just me. The management was incredibly strict around some of us and yet they would never help out when we were in a rush, always standing off to the side watching.The only thing I enjoyed was the flexible work shifts and the access to employee discounts.

Flexible Scheduling and Job Security,"A typical day at work for me involves either working the register, or self checkout. In my three years working for Walmart, I've learned a plethora of customer service skills, management skills, and a whole lot of patience. Management has never been bad, but there were times at which we had only two team leads, when we typically are supposed to have at least four or five, leaving those who were working to be frazzled and spread out very thin. There have also been times in which we were lacking frontend staff, with only one or two registers open at a time because we didn't have enough cashiers to work them and the self checkouts. The workplace culture is alright, personally I've never been too involved in it since I keep to myself, but from what I've seen, most people have been alright, and I don't have any issues with any of my coworkers, team leads, or supervisors. I'd say the hardest part of the job is having to deal work with a short handed staff, while the most enjoyable part is getting rotate what position I work at throughout the day so that I don't get burnt out doing the same thing.

My management  was not though so much it made me quit, a man who wasn’t even manager loved to play big boss and get really rowdy with us employees.

Has flexible scheduling - management is insufferable ,"For my store, the experience is a mixed bag, based almost entirely on which department you end up in because that determines who your manager is. I think cashiering has the most schedule flexibility, and is the most straightforward job in the store. Working service desks requires juggling multiple hats. Both of these positions make the same pay. ",3,Current Employee,Service Desk/Money Center Associate ,"Iola, KS",9/28/22,2022,9,28

Lack of employees ,Working w/ Walmart was decent. The team lead i worked under was less than favorable.

My store would continuously hire for OGP while all other departments were struggling.,3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"High Point, NC",9/28/22,2022,9,28
Good place to get your foot in the door for greater things,"Walmart is the perfect place to get your foot in the door for other positions. Working in the back room will give you experience operating pallet jacks and potentially forklifts/walkie stackers. Although it is not a great job by itself, it can lay the foundation to meet new people and grow a network. There is also often opportunity for growth, although it is probably better that you look elsewhere after a few months. ",4,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Tipton, IA",9/28/22,2022,9,28
Walmart Sucks,Walmart management is trash!  They don’t care how sick you are still have to come to work. The managers always put their work load on the coworkers. I’ve seen an employee have a seizure the managers didn’t even care.,1,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Lebanon, TN",9/28/22,2022,9,28
Good Work Environment ,"In the short while I worked here, I enjoyed it for the most part. The managers were decent and would listen to concerns.

Work is not a priority here. ,"There are no department managers, only team leads who are in charge of 4-6 departments at a time.  No one is supervising the staff in each department, so there’s a lot of standing around, chit-chatting with coworkers, gossiping, etc.  This non supervised approach to work creates an environment of entitlement from its employees.  When customers need help, employees are annoyed and put out.  It’s not a place to work, it’s a place to hang out.   There are older male team leads and coaches and other higher ups constantly favoring and texting/communicating with high school girls on and off the clock.  You will not get any training, then get yelled at when you make a mistake.   No support from team leads or management while doing daily tasks when customers need help.  Leads and management will let customers scream at you while they are no where to be found.   They also turn a blind eye to rampant shoplifting, that includes the asset protection department.  Only time the higher ups are around is when corporate or the market manager show up.  ",1,Former Employee,Self Checkout Host ,"Burbank, CA",9/28/22,2022,9,28

High paced and unrelenting management playing favorites.,"Regularly fires employees for using sick days, which it gives very little. Rude and demeaning management that plays favorites.

It was a fine first job,"I got hired instantly. Basically no training was given. Policies were constantly being changed, it was hard to keep up since I only worked one shift per week.

",3,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,Minnesota,9/27/22,2022,9,27
"Inconsistent, overworked","Turnover is always high, even in management, so you'll lose anyone you have that's good, and so you basically have to fend for yourself because no one will be around to help you, overtime ends up being necessary because of call-outs and bad management, it goes all the way up to corporate - I don't think they know how the stores actually function because they are constantly implementing new things without teaching, transitioning, or even a good reason for it at all. Especially in OPD, (Online Pickup & Delivery) the system is constantly being changed up without warning and you go through cycles of dismantling the way the entire department runs and rebuilding from the ground up, it's exhausting and confusing. You can keep a position for a while if you have a good manager and more stable department, they pay relatively well (but the yearly pay raise doesn't keep up with the new hire wages/inflation at all). The chance of getting a promotion or even just some recognition for a job well done is so low it may as well be a lottery.

"Insubordinate employees, poor management","No repercussions for insubordinate employees given from management. Employees who refuse to do their basic job outlines and twiddle their thumbs for the day and get paid the same. Extreme lack of any team work. You can beg the team leads to ask the insubordinate employees to help and get no help because they’re afraid of the insubordinate employees reactions. You just get told to do it all and are expected to get your job done. I was a widely utilized employee there because my co workers wouldn’t do their jobs. It was incredibly stressful and I couldn’t stand it. I even did my team leads jobs for the same pay. One team lead said to my other one, “I don’t feel like doing this at all, but I remembered she (me) works today so I’m just gonna tell her to do it”.

Stocking is good work, but often at least a little stressful depending on how busy it is and if they ask you to stock more than normal. Supervisors and managers could do more to ensure that all stocking jobs are evenly distributed throughout the shift; I often had to stay hours later to finish my assigned department with no help from other stockers that may finish and leave early. I don't blame the other stockers; management told us that they'd send finished stockers to help others who were not finished before the shift ends.",4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Batesburg-Leesville, SC",9/27/22,2022,9,27

So every day that you plan out seems to frequently get sidetracked by customer care.  Which is part of the job but might now be expected if you are new to retail.

A Job,"Plain and simple. It's a job. You're paid fairly, do your duties, clock out at the end of the day, and that's it.For some people that's exactly what they're looking for. Management was average, some better than others as always. If you're looking for an impactful career, this probably is not for you. If you need a job and a consistent pay check, sign up.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Janesville, WI",9/26/22,2022,9,26
Stressful and depressing,Taking a job at Walmart I thought I'd have opportunities to move up in advance especially since I'm older Walmart has shown they don't care about a person's health as long as they aren't getting hurt at work. They also don't really care if you have family issues or family things that come up. They don't work well with attendance they give you a point rating which can be messed up even when you try your best not to and they will fire you if you break over the points with no reason given.,2,Current Employee,Automotive Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",9/26/22,2022,9,26

Integrity of the company as a whole. ,I worked there for 15 years of my life learned a lot from my fellow co-workers I was never really one to sit there and tell somebody they did a good job when they hadn't. When working for Walmart you need to suck up to your manager and let them know they're doing a better job than what they are because the expectations are not high only the manner in which you can conduct your brown nosing skills. ,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Kingman, AZ",9/26/22,2022,9,26

"Cool coworkers, terrible management","The job was not very hard, but the coaches are absolute brain dead morons who seem to think treating their employees like trash is the way to do things. You would constantly see them walking around in groups as if that helped anything in the store. The store was an absolute mess and these coaches would not do a thing to actually help unless the market managers swung by to scope out the place. The place was getting worse the last few months there where associates were being blamed for not being able to finish these ridiculous tasks. Again, it is a very easy job but these managers make the place unbearable and I would have left much sooner if my coworkers weren't truly awesome people. Only reason this place gets a 2 is because of them. I made lots of friends in my time there and I appreciate them so much in my 3 years there. Made things so much better during the day.",2,Former Employee,Home Team Associate ,"Victoria, TX",9/26/22,2022,9,26
"Horrendous Management, You're Just A Number And Don't Expect Any Career Advancement","If you enjoy pointless work, ego fueled management and a career leading to little pay and horrible benefits then you've found just the place.

Good/ staff has their favorites ,It’s a good place to work if you do ur job a need mind your business.

Horrible. ,"They do not care about their employees or any problems the employees have. Management doesn’t do anything to help their employees. They expect you to work whatever hours they schedule you regardless of your availability that you provide before they hire you. Mandatory overtime or different shifts than you originally applied for are expected if it’s needed by the store, which happens often. You can’t request time off during any holidays or store events like Black Friday or annual inventory. Most of the time your time off is not approved whether or not you have paid time off to cover it. Do not work here, it’s not worth it. The higher they pay for the positions means they can screw you more so it’s not worth it. Do not work here if you have or want any kind of life outside of work. This company uses you until you burn yourself out then blame it on you and say you aren’t working hard enough. ",1,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Newton, IA",9/26/22,2022,9,26
The management was overall messy and unorganized.,"I liked working at Walmart, but the management was very poor. At one point I was working in the back moving boxes, I am very small and was alone, one of the managers told me to work at a faster pace because I was never going to finish. There were over 200 boxes. I obviously am not a superhuman so I did not finish. I worked my hardest to work as quickly as possible.",2,Former Employee,Team Associate ,"Princeton, KY",9/26/22,2022,9,26
It's great for your first job and it has many benefits ,"All in all the company is great nothing really troubling about it. Many people have different experiences because of different managers. The people can make the job more fun and exciting or boring, hard, and stressful. Great benefits for every age level, and great employee gifts and treats. The only complaint I have is about the higher ups, and that's if they don't like you or they are getting in trouble they sometimes have bad behavior towards you.",4,Current Employee,Stocking Associate ,Alabama,9/26/22,2022,9,26

Outsiders have no real voice. The bullies always win. They do not like people who out do them. They try to intimidate those people. They think your after their jobs.

"Good job, Bad management ",The job itself it amazing and you learn a lot about technology. I also get to learn about creating canvass’s and photos which is cool. The only bad thing is management. They are always on you and expect so much for such low pay. ,1,Current Employee,Walmart Electronics Associate ,"Bakersfield, CA",9/25/22,2022,9,25
Cool and easy place to work when there’s actual staff involved ,"That’s pretty much it, the job itself is easy.

Walmart does not invest in its leadership and does not care that they are biggest Corporation of the WORST Bosses in the World!,"ALL Management lack leadership and soft skills necessary to engage effectively with their associates.  Many behave in a way that is offensive, disrespectful or uncaring when guidance or direction is sought. They are unprofessional in handling sensitive issues or conflict and do not respond with empathy or concern for those they manage.  They are not focused on associate career development or helping associates be successful. It is a culture based on fear and public humiliation. Daily occurrences of chastising for mistakes on an open sales floor with peers as an audience is common practice. This creates a culture of bad behaviors.  Employees lie, blame others or outright sabotage their peers to keep any bad feedback directed away from themselves.  Unreasonable expectations from hard workers and unaccountability and favoritism for those popular with management create a toxic environment.  All could be solved by Teaching  and Training Leadership how to treat people with respect and dignity.",1,Former Employee,Overnight Manager ,"Great Falls, MT",9/24/22,2022,9,24
Overall great job ,"Pay starts out good even as a cashier starts out at 12.00 or 13.00 now. Interviews are fairly laid back in person. I loved most of all my managers, HR person and coworkers . Once there for a while it becomes like family. Work is easy to learn. Stocker,cashier,online grocery pickup department. It is fast paced but you get used to it. I personally enjoyed it. Rules are constantly changing as far as pto usage and it’s hard to get days off even requesting months ahead of time. Definitely utilize your benefits. Like medical and they pay for school.

No work/life balance and a terrible company culture,"Salaried management at Walmart is brutal, they often work you 70+ hours a week, they frequently restructure and will force you to move or step down when your position is eliminated.

All Bad Actually,"On a typical day at a retail location I am lucky to not be bothered by management, and I am lucky to be able to stay in my department and do work that I was hired to do. Managers micromanage, hyper-focus on pointless busy work, and accept the trash customers' word without ever standing up for you. Managers do unethical things, yell at you in front of customers, and are incompetent. Perhaps because of the intense and regular turnover, terrible employees are kept employed there for too long. Good employees are given more work and work that is above their pay grade. Overtime is almost never allowed. Pay is pathetic and raises low to nonexistent. Paid leave options are meager and have fun going to work sick, which you will probably have to do! Promotions are given according to who kisses the best butt. Customers are fast with their prejudice and slow with their appreciation. Your skills and any personal charms will not save you from their rage. You will learn new reasons to hate your fellow man after having this job.All the company cares about are its profits and shareholders. Anyone who has been there for long will tell you it used to be better, and they have been saying that for about a decade at least.The worst part of the job is how you will get the worst pay, fair to poor treatment (depending on factors such as management which are outside your control), and also no respect from the general public even with all you may go through. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving at the end of your shift on time, or most reliably-- walking out on your last day!",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Waynesboro, VA",9/24/22,2022,9,24
Good Job,"Out of all the jobs I’ve worked it this one was the easiest by far, never had a problem the managers are super calm they don’t expect you to go above and beyond just complete the work they ask you to do, I’ve never had a problem with any manager but there is always that one person who thinks they are the manager, if you are looking for a part time college job or even full time they have great benefits and very good pay ",5,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Hackettstown, NJ",9/24/22,2022,9,24

Overall a good place to work,"Walmart is an overall good place to work. The company provides you with good benefit, plus protect time off, which you can use at anytime for any reason without being reprimanded. If you show up to work on time and do the work assigned to you, you will have no issues. If you are a full time employee, you will always work 40 hours no matter what and overtime is rear , unless you are in management. Pay is not great if you are comparing it to other retail establishment but it has improved in the last couple of years. Depending on your region, starting pay is $15 per hour for most departments. There is always room to move up in the company but if you enter into management, your job becomes your life. It will be challenging to balance work and home life.",4,Current Employee,Online Fulfillment Manager ,"Santa Fe, NM",9/24/22,2022,9,24

Job description,"The job in the company is it bad. This is a great place to start after you graduate because of pay is high, it’s a very easy job and they have a lot of benefits especially seasonal hourly raise.

The managers aren’t the most honest with you. Some of them are but most of them set the work environment up in cliques. ,They promise progression but it rarely happens unless you happen to be a favorite. If you are a good worker you are worked into the ground with very few benefits. If you get injured they don’t care. Rarely ever do doctors notes work. If you are a single parent with little to no support system you don’t have much of a chance of being able to have a work family balance. You will get fired if you miss work because of your family too often. Sometimes they feed you for lunch which is nice. And they do have team building activities they occasionally do. ,2,Former Employee,Picker/Packer ,"Shepherdsville, KY",9/24/22,2022,9,24

Poor Training and Bad Management ,So I’ve been in a variety of positions and my main gripe is that training is very lacking. They throw you into the positions with little training. One position I was in for a year then finally had training videos which I already knew most of the stuff it mentioned already. They have this “open door policy” cause they don’t believe in unions. It’s complete bs and is just a way for management to not really help you or still beside lower managers that are worse than them. If I known they had no union I wouldn’t have applied for them. Never go to a job with no union! They take advantage by having you work multiple departments then when you have issues barely even are helpful. The only positive is meeting nice people you work with. That’s it. I’ve met one of my besties and that’s the only highlight. ,2,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Chantilly, VA",9/24/22,2022,9,24

Low pay and low morale ,"One of the worst jobs I’ve ever had. Most coworkers are nice but some just want to nit pick on everything everyone else does and complain constantly. The pay is a starvation wage of $13/hour, enough for a student living with their parents but not enough for a working man such as myself. The managers never give a good job today only complain and make negative comments. The only plus side was some customers are very nice, most are not though and/or stupid. ",2,Former Employee,Digital shopper  ,"Radcliff, KY",9/24/22,2022,9,24
Worst auto center I've ever worked for,Management is a joke. It's run like a circuis. This auto center is short handed all the time and definitely see why. They don't train at all have to rely on 18 year olds to try and show you how to use the computer and things like that. If I didn't know how to change oil and bust tires I would have really been screwed. Every day we had upset customers not enough workers and lines of cars and customers. Pay was actually decent for an oil lube job but wasn't worth the stress and BS. Benifits are good if you're full time. Also the few guys I did work with were cool. I think if you work at Walmart in a different department or at least a department or auto center that was ran decent it would be worth it. ,1,Former Employee,TLE Technician ,"Anthem, AZ",9/23/22,2022,9,23

"Seemingly high starting pay for no experience, that's the best part.","Any associate who's worked for the Walmart Distribution Center foe more than 2 months is aware they are put in constant lose-lose situations. Integrity and safety as defined by the company are punished in roundabout ways and the unspoken rule is ""production, production, production."" An associate who takes on almost as much responsibility as a manager makes almost exactly what someone hired a week ago makes. The equipment is constantly breaking/malfunctioning and the associates with production quotas usually pay for it with having to work frantically to meet their required numbers. The turnover rate is extremely high here. There's a reason.",2,Current Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Sanger, TX",9/23/22,2022,9,23
"Okay for retail, horrid management","The managers would do things like give a 20-cent raise, and then raise you back up to the minimum, which was a dollar raise, so more often than not a person who was working there for several years was still only making as much as a fresh hire.

Management seems to be fair though a strong lack of communication seems to be a major problem with both local and corporate levels.

"It’s pays, decent benefits and free *college","CAP 2, Deli/Bakery are my most known fields, and the honest review is CAP 2 in particular are worked like dogs (coming from other people near the STL and myself included) but they are respected amongst management. Deli/Bakery rely on the people more than the team as a whole, so if they aren’t doing their job to the fullest, they usually already have you set up for failure before your day has started. Managers are the single biggest obstacle, because they could hire from outside the company and you have a high chance of getting someone who knows next to nothing, but they are your team lead  and have to do what they say. All together not a bad place, they just don’t prefer to do things the easy way. The benefits are pretty decent, the highlight of them besides a 10% discount with an occasional extra 25%, is the (as far as I’m aware) entirely paid for college.

No matter what you do it's never enough, and the micromanagement is a joke. It is what, it is. ",2,Former Employee,Senior Meat Cutter ,"Farmington, NM",9/23/22,2022,9,23

Terrible,"I worked here for seven years. It was a continual rotation of abusive team leads, and managers.  The “higher ups,” are manipulative and can’t be counted on for help, and the attitude overall is that you are just a minion and lucky to have a job there.

Great pay.. thats about all!,"They do pay very well and there is shift differential! I've worked in multiple departments over the years, all management is different, however, they all do play favorites! If you're liked, you will succeed here. Know your rights as an associate because they will take advantage of you. Your more so a 'number' than a human being! They expect 120% effort from good hard workers but don't appreciate it. They dont have enough working equipment for everyone so you have to scour the building to find what you need to perform your duties! I do like my co-workers but it's like high school, everyone is in everyones business, drama! There's a very high turn over rate, including the management! Depending on the season, you may not make your hours or may be mandated overtime. You have to work holidays without getting holiday pay. The building is poorly run, there's a lot of people who walk around and do absolutely nothing(regular associates as well as higher up) while your expected to bust your butt.

Easy job for pay,Working with Walmart has been one of the best opportunities I could’ve gotten. I work at the DC in Colton 6561 as a weekend overnight forklift operator; my job is to receive product gradually and make sure I receive a specific number of product daily. I get paid great for what I do so no complains. Only downfall is having to deal with favoritism but only in some shifts.,5,Former Employee,Forklift Operator ,"Colton, CA",9/22/22,2022,9,22
Good starter job for one's age 18-23,"The work at Walmart is simple, yet they have strict quotas in which they expect you to follow, however, depending on your management, they can be understanding if you happen to slightly miss the mark on some days, however you are typically expected to meet the quotes or possible even go above which is especially true for the stocking shifts. If you get hired on the digital team, the work environment is much better and more relaxed than the others. Scheduling can be an issue for some but for part timers at least in my experience has been very flexible and they usually stick with your availability. They also pay for college, trade schools, and certifications, making this a great job to start at if you are between the ages 18-23 and if your future career aligns with what they pay for. There is a decent chance you can move up in management if you so choose but management typically step down fairly quickly after promotion due to what they have to deal with on a daily basis. Overall, I believe this is a great place to start due to the paid for schooling, low experience required to work, and decent pay compared to other similar jobs.  Be part time for a couple years and Reep the rewards. ",4,Current Employee,Digital Personal Shopper ,"Herkimer, NY",9/22/22,2022,9,22

Nothing ,"1. A  typical day at walmart was going into work getting 7 or eight pallets and others got 1 or 2 pallets that they did not finished the entire night. 2. This was  a horrible place to work,  people getting more pallets than other people and all they do is walk around on their cell phones doing nothing.  3. That certain  managers are unskilled and has  favoritism for certain staff. 4. I like the culture for the most part most of the staff got along with each other. 5.

Quite Ridiculous ,"I find it ridiculous that this company really only hires for part-time and they require you to have complete open availability from 7AM - 11PM with ALL days open. Plus the pay is not worth it. The only way it makes sense for a human being to have complete open availability for a job like that especially if it’s part time is if you’re paying almost $30 an hour & we all know that this Walmart in Milford is paying less than $15. In this day and age that’s insulting for a labor job like that. Rent is rising like crazy, gas prices are insane, I mean I just spent six dollars on a gallon of milk at the grocery store. This company expects you to give all your time to them but not give you anything in return, they can’t even give you good hours!! NO ONE can pay bills on those hours & wage. The only people who have it decent here are the managers. All Walmart cares about is making money, they DO NOT care about their associates at all in anyway shape or form. What they offer you for employment states that blatantly. ",1,Former Employee,Associate ,"Milford, PA",9/21/22,2022,9,21

I wouldn’t waste my time again,"In the year that I worked at Walmart I had so many occurrences where I felt like management my took advantage of the fact that I needed a job to support my family while going thru hardships I was told that my attendance would be the cause of me getting fired. Don’t think about taking doctors notes they don’t approve your attendance unless your admitted in the hospital, children and spouse doctors notes don’t count for absences unless you go through sedwick to have a leave approved. You’ll be lucky if you have at least one manager that has your back if you don’t your in trouble don’t get your hopes up to have important days off or leave early from your shift unless you have more than enough PPTO or PTO. Forget about calling out in “key dates “ your get hit with a double adherence for your attendance oh and never expect to have your breaks and lunches on time or leave on time, it never happens you’ll always end up having to remind that your over on time except to get written up if you go to lunch late or if you accidentally click out to late even if you try and fix your time clock you’ll eventually get written up for it and the manager will hold you accountable and will constantly remind you, you there’s always someone who can take your job",2,Former Employee,Front End Cashier ,"El Paso, TX",9/21/22,2022,9,21

No gold star, nothing.Just endless work & a write up at your heels.All in all, it paid the bills. Had insurance but never got to use it, can't say if it's worth it or not. (I hardly got sick)In 2017-2019, you were allowed up to 8 or 9 points.

Many different areas of opportunity/favoritism in advancement,"Walmart could be an excellent place to work and grow if only corporate would get their heads out of their hind quarters.  It’s not hard to see the favoritism in some stores.  It’s also not hard to see why there is so much confusion within some of them.  The store I worked at had VERY little leadership.  If an employee wanted to learn how to do something, they typically had to figure it out themselves.  Aside from the obvious leadership fails and major favoritism, the company has thousands of different opportunities for advancement.  I gave such a low rating for my experience specifically at my store.

Too many chiefs. Broken promises.,"I was pulled from the area I was excelling at and sent out of area multiple times and was pushed to take a job that management knew was going to be eliminated. I didn't apply for the job. When I didn't take the job, I was put back into a shipping trailer that I worked so hard to get out of learning new skills and passing my lift test that I was never given a license for. I was told by two different managers I'd learn to run two different areas where I was currently working and kept getting put in a trailer with heavy lanes. I was then put on three person lanes while having a lane by myself. This company will work you like a horse then wonder why you're upset when they promises THEY MADE don't ever happen. HR doesn't so anything. Home office doesn't do anything. The managers believe hearsay and never ask you directly about any concerns. You'll get pulled from an area with no explanation. Hours were cut by a third and people are quitting left and right. A lot of employees have bad attitudes and instigate strife between coworkers. If you aren't willing to be buddy buddy with management, don't waste your time there. If you have to call in a day, you'll be put on heavy lanes or in an areas you dislike the next say you come to work. Go literally anywhere else. They treat you like a dog.",1,Former Employee,Loader ,"Cullman, AL",9/21/22,2022,9,21

It’s ok as a first job but depending on who you know depends on your experience.,I was fired after returning for work for military leave. There was never consistent management. You have to basically befriend someone in a higher position to get a long in the company. A coworker had been working there for longer than 8 years and was never considered for a higher position.

Points are received by calling out on scheduled days, being tardy by more than 9 minutes, and/or having to clock out early. - There are a large amount of training videos but never any time allotted to watch them, had to do it on my breaks- No piercings or unnaturally dyed hair- Favoritism, lots and lots of favoritism ",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Crestview, FL",9/21/22,2022,9,21

On top of that many areas were understaffed consistently leaving all work to 1 or 2 workers when 5 or more were needed. The introduced a new management system as well which was fine but I did not have a good experience with my new management. I was pushed harder and harder with no praise or proper education on new assignments and all reprimand.

"Fast paced, disorganized, not a care for your physical well-being","A typical day here was exhausting to say the least. I would go home everyday and cry from being overworked past my physical limits, after being told I wouldn't be required to do any sort of heavy lifting due to my extremely small size. I learned not to trust anyone there and we were all expendable. Management is lacking. They don't appreciate feedback and they don't care if you're hurting. They even asked me to climb a shelf once!! Very dangerous job. The culture is subpar; it's Walmart. You will work with a number of different people, and you may not even meet them all. The hardest part of the job was the vital weight I lost trying to keep my pace up to their standards. If you are someone with a small frame and fast metabolism, I highly suggest looking elsewhere. They will run you into the ground because you look healthier/younger than the older people they can't fire because they have protections, even though you may be 30, or even 40 with a back problem. The only good thing was the hour long break you get for lunch, if they even let you take lunch that day. When the store was too busy and they piled on yet another task that should have been the team leads job, you couldn't take your lunch break until an hour before you left. From there, they would make you stay at the store in order to clock out so that it shows they ""gave you a lunch break"".

Stressful Position,I worked in the pharmacy almost two years. It was a stressful environment. Felt like I was in high school all over again. People stayed in their cliques and there was no job training. Management was horrible. One of the pharmacists always ignored me when I asked questions. When I resigned the pharmacy manager asked if I could transfer inside the store but I couldn't deal with the anxiety and depression. I still get nervous going into the store years later.,2,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,Kentucky,9/19/22,2022,9,19
Favoritism!!,"If the Management like you then you’ll make it, but if they feel threatened by you in anyway… example if your smarter, prettier, and won’t let them talk to you like a kid.

A clean and fast paced environment ,"I enjoyed working here, the thing I liked most was my co-workers, and some of the customers questions. It's a great place to work as long as you don't wake up sick or have a family emergency, that requires you to call-in on a scheduled workday. The 5 point call-in system works like a factory, they could care less if you were in an accident, hospitalized, or lost a lung. Five call-ins and you're fires. It's not a family oriented company, that's for sure. Management has their ""picks"" of who can miss more than 5 days and points magically disappear.

Started out being a great job! Good benefits and fun atmosphere. ,"Walmart was a great company to work for. After Sam Walton died things being to change.

Poor management brings down a good team.,The Walmart I worked for was nice when I first started.

Great for part-time.,I work as a stocker at Walmart and for what I can say is its easy work. If your in high school or college that want a part-time job this company is pretty okay to work for.

Life draining ,Every day you’re met with the same bs and challenges if not more than you struggled to get through the day before. It never ends.

Bad: Everything ,"A typical workday for this company is checking out customers, hearing complaints, dealing with managers that have personal vendettas, and very poor work environments. When you first begin at this company there are many many things to learn; you learn about each department and what that department includes, you learn the many many policies of the company that they don't enforce, you learn how to work in your department and how long that work will take, and then depending on the department that you're in; you'll learn how to scan items into the store's system and then place them on the shelves. The management for this company need more proper training on how to work with individuals that aren't the same title. Management for this company do not work well with others and do not know how to approach associates appropriately with situations in regards to the workplace policies. As far as workplace culture, depending on who you're working with you could either have a bad day or a good day. If you're working with someone you enjoy  being around then you'll have a good day, if you're working with people that you don't get along with then you'll have a bad day. Management will not do anything to fix a situation in regards to your problems with other associates and don't attempt to request off anything because they will ask for proof and they won't give you what you want. The hardest thing about working with this company is keeping your sanity. And the best thing about working for this company is leaving to go home when you clock out.

My coworkers were also super nice, I made friends and it was a somewhat good environment. Now for the bad…well the managers were not so kind, they were weirdly strict and just outright mean sometimes. Sometimes it’s slow and they get mad at you for not doing something even if there is nothing to do. I got in trouble once for something that I didn’t even do/say and it was annoying. Also they will work you to the bone, like holidays basically every day of your life becomes work.

"Love my co-workers, fun place to work!","I have been at my location for less than 2 years, started part-time, and moved up to full-time with an excellent schedule and raise in pay. My managers push you to excel and move up the ladder to other positions. The managers do work with your scheduling needs. The work is fast-paced but before you know it it's time to clock out. My coworkers really work as a team, so grateful for that! I think the pay should be higher than it is but overall I'm satisfied with my employment with Walmart.",5,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Wilson, NC",9/16/22,2022,9,16
Too rigid and challenging,"It’s not the worst place to work but they have a high turn over rate for a reason. They have extremely high production demands and are a ZERO tolerance policy for reasonable mistakes and issues. They don’t have the best orientation and training and you’ll have to figure a lot of it out on yourself. RSR is the department I worked for and it was technically the easiest because you’re on a forklift, the other departments are even more demanding. Shipping and receiving is considered the worst. Management as a whole can be dehumanizing. The managers themselves along with literally everyone, even security look and act miserable. It’s decent pay for entry level if you can figure out how to meet production goals. Also very important. DO NOT GO OVER PRODUCTION! If you’re able to figure it out and want to go above and beyond, THEY WILL INCREASE THE PRODUCTION FOR EVERYONE. Because they do no see it as you being an exemplary worker, they see it as “oh it looks like this is achievable so therefore we can demand it of everyone” If you miss even ONE day due to emergency and don’t report it it’s automatic termination. Regardless of the situation. All in all, the expectations are way too high, you also have multiple duties. As a whole, your department is also in charge of janitorial duties and warehouse cleaning. It’s a lot. The pay, again, is just alright. There’s better paying places but this one is just easier to get into if you have a clean record.

"Fun employees, decent/bad managers, overworking you for only $15 an hour",For the amount of work you do you get paid as almost everyone else in the store that does considerable less work than you. Also HR will stack orders on OGP with no regard to how many people is working that day even though they also cut peoples hours. And yes everyone’s hours has the potential to be cut especially if you’re under 18. The management only has two good team leads and the other is terrible along with the coach running over it.

"Dishonest, Not Employee-Friendly","Incompetent and emotionally unfit management is the norm. Employees are not treated as functional adults, but helpless children or merely tools to make them money at all costs. The company is as shady and as cold-hearted as it gets. Schedules change overnight without notice and the employee is punished for not knowing. Employees are told, not asked, to stay late, then punished or not paid for the overtime. Breaks? What breaks? Good luck even getting your supposedly mandatory lunch, but rest assured you’ll be punished for skipping it! Expectations are unrealistic with constant understaffing, broken or missing equipment, zero rules enforced with customer conduct, and poor communication between departments. The stores are constantly in violation of OSHA rules, food safety laws, labor laws, and all sorts of abuse and discrimination, which more often than not is covered up with no consequences for anyone except those who reported it. The company values of honesty, integrity, etc that they preach about are a joke.

Management/superiors will tell you to do soemthing but not do it themselves. I was an up front person who got stuck putting away department items because although every department in the beginning of their shifts are SUPPOSED to get the items from behind the front end counters they do not. So as a front end worker you already do other people's jobs. They will whine if not enough registers are open. Co-workers do less than bare minimum while working. Management will also be demanding of you but not do the things they say they require of you. There isn't much reward for this place if Im being honest. The new one has been put through many management changes but I don't think it is for the best, previous management was indeed bad but these new people are not better either.

Terrible and ignorant management that care more about numbers than the opinions and needs of their employees,"At Walmart the employees as far as I’ve seen are treated as numbers. Their opinions and needs mean nothing even when clearly correct or obviously needed to fill the sometimes excessive and over the top demands the leads give. Employees are seen as disposable by them, easy to throw around and easy to get rid of. Favoritism is also highly rampant among staff. I have witnessed coworkers get off without so much as even a slap on the wrist from showing up to work hours late and leaving hours early alongside getting any day they’d like off, switching the entire schedule to cater to them while the vast majority of us are denied any requests for free time regardless of urgency, leading us to call in and take points for it. If a customer is clearly in the wrong even with the lead’s knowing so, we are still forced to apologize and are sometimes written up regardless.

It either they like you or don't. Also they play favor, and don't want to communicate with you about things. When you need to talk to them, they hardly ever there or you can't find them.. The worse part is that they cut hour only to those they dislike and not other they tend to like.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Columbus, OH",9/14/22,2022,9,14
Associates are hard working. Management is not.,Pros: Set schedule and days off. Insurance is pretty good.

It's fine when you first start but goes downhill from there.,"When I first started working at Walmart, I was excited. It slowly got worse and worse until my mental health was affected. The higher-ups tend to make power trips and have no care for their employees. When I left, it was after I was given a no-win situation that made me break down in front of them. I was told I wasn't working hard even though I was carrying the whole department on my back with very little help because of all the new employees they had to hire to cover those who had left. I would never recommend anyone work here if they want to stay happy. Working there was worse for my mental health than I expected, don't let it happen to you too.",1,Former Employee,Online Order Fulfillment ,"Springfield, IL",9/14/22,2022,9,14

Horrible,No management assistance no managers ever around. Managers never speak to you associates basically run the store. I highly recommend finding elsewhere to work Walmart don't care about their employees. They would rather throw away things that employees could use them give them to those that need. If you or an immediate family member gets ill you will never hear one word from management checking on the status of you or your family member. Most associates are either yelled at or they simply run their department with no management help. And it is extremely rare that you will hear thank you great job. I do not recommend working at Walmart unless it's one of the stores where the managers do take the time to care. Very depressing very stressful and extremely not worth it.,1,Current Employee,Customer service representative ,"Hammond, IN",9/13/22,2022,9,13
Great Pay But you gotta work for every dime ,Pays great but order filling is very strenuous. No certain time to get off just when the trips run out you log out of headset and go home..

Draining work environment with little to no benefit other than pay,"They have an extremely strict sick day policy, which I can understand to a degree, up until you have a medical emergency at work and have to decide between taking a ""point"" to be able to go to the ER and staying at least another couple hours so you only have to take half a point. The pay was nice but the managers claim to be there to help you when really it feels like they only care about how you make them look. Zero regard for mental health and their policies around discrimination are laughable with how they actually go about handling anything. At least you get a 10% discount after 90 days of employment, right?",1,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Vermillion, SD",9/13/22,2022,9,13

Can be a good place to work if the store location has good management. ,My experience was awful. The managers will make you hate working for Walmart. Managers don’t care when departments are short handed and refuse to send help or come help themselves. Managers pick favorites that can get away with anything and the favorites are handed promotions before they are interviewed for the new position and the manager only interviews other candidates because they have to pick 3 people to interview by policy. ,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Clarksville, AR",9/13/22,2022,9,13

Depends on what you want,"If you're just looking for easy money, the work isn't difficult especially if you're in the online grocery dept. Expectations are borderline impossible to achieve but it's the norm so if you do well enough you won't have to worry too much.If you're looking to build a career, understand that the company's expectations actively prevent you from doing a good job. Good managers are difficult to come by and the rest only care about making their bosses happy. They only care about metrics and if you're not on process, good luck. You'll receive so much pushback from managers who don't know anything about your department even if it's the correct decision.",3,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"Las Vegas, NV",9/13/22,2022,9,13

fine at times , it was an ok job at first but slowly became stressful and overwhelming due to no help or instruction from management or team leads. you were pretty much left to do everything on your own due to no-one being around half the time. the pay was pretty decent and coworkers were nice it was just the lack of communication from the higher ups that threw me off.  ,3,Former Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Tilton, NH",9/13/22,2022,9,13
A lot of pressure ,"They run on a point system. You get a point if you call in and a half point if you’re late. When you get 5 points they let you go but they like to pick favorites so they will clear certain peoples points, I’ve seen it happen and talked to plenty of employees to confirm this and they aren’t supposed to do this due to favoritism. They do not offer holiday pay and they do not offer overtime. ",1,Current Employee,Front End Cashier ,"Bakersfield, CA",9/13/22,2022,9,13
Management are completely clueless.,"Walmart sucks, management is constantly playing ""catch-up"", management at my location runs the entire store on a frayed shoestring, there's not enough associates on staff to do the work required, pallet jacks are unusable and unsafe, unsafe work conditions are ignored by management EVEN when the safety issue is explained to them.",1,Current Employee,Associate ,"Parkersburg, WV",9/13/22,2022,9,13

Terrible place to work,For Walmart to be as big of a company as they are they are very unorganized. They lied about being a flexible work space. For a while it worked then it completely went south. I was terminated because the manger didn’t schedule me properly. I gave her my school schedule multiple of times and she lost them. I went to her to help fix my occurrences weeks before the termination. She took her time to take them off which led to me being terminated. That wouldn’t have happened if she didn’t schedule me during classes. I talked/complained to HR and ethics. All they said was thank you for your time basically. Again if you are a college student this job isn’t for you. If you like organized business this job isn’t for you. Even the management is bad. That whole store got a ring going on. ,1,Former Employee,Self-Checkout Hosts ,"Fayetteville, NC",9/13/22,2022,9,13

"Good pay, awkward hours","The pay is great for the work you do compared to most other entry-level retail.

Turnover and management is ridiculous ,"The pay is great, but in one month alone over 20 people quit/got fired on 3rd shift alone. Management expects more than is required (corporate requires a box a minute, but for ON managers that’s TOO slow)  and communication is lackluster. The coworkers are great but don’t expect to be told you’re doing anything other than a poor job during the meetings. ",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Wooster, OH",9/13/22,2022,9,13

Not a career but a job.,"The pay is average and the job isn't too hard. The management would be better off hiring literal monkeys to do their jobs. What I mean by this is that they were so underqualified it's not even funny. They'd make a mistake, get stressed, possibly not finish a task, then blame us... and then do it again the next day. It's been a minute since I've worked there but the customers were either really nice, or had this misplaced arrogance. Like they thought they were smarter than me when asking for the location of pickles... while standing right in front of the shelf of hard-to-miss pickles.

Very little direction from management; it's hard to even find out who the manager is for the shift(s) you work.  (This may be unique to the West Boylston, MA store.)  Communication is unclear as a result, and it's difficult to know who to report issues to during your shift.  They run the business with mostly PT employees to limit paying benefits.  They also cut hours without notice and haven't held true to what was indicated for hours during my interview. Very difficult to manage personal expenses (rent, food, gas, etc.) when you don't know what you'll be earning each week.  It's also difficult to plan things in your personal life because your hours can change from week to week with very little notice.",1,Former Employee,Retail Associate ,"West Boylston, MA",9/13/22,2022,9,13

Productive Workplace with Great Co-workers,"As a Walmart stocker, some days can be really busy depending on the size of the trucks, but if you have a great team, the job can be pretty fun and productive. Overall I would say I enjoyed my time here mainly because I had co-workers that made the job tolerable. The managers we're also pretty down to earth and easy to work with, most of the time.",4,Former Employee,General Stocker/Customer Assistance ,"Floresville, TX",9/12/22,2022,9,12
Not what you expect,I have worked for two different Walmarts in the same state. Some co workers were awesome. Some are less to be desired. Many want to do the bare minimum and management is ok with this. If you are a hard worker they will run you into the ground. One walmart I quit due to health issues caused by working there. The other let me go due to missed days due to same health issues coming up. Pay isn't worth the stress that they give you. No management pick favorites and it really shows. ,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Richlands, NC",9/12/22,2022,9,12
Bad management and employees ,Mangers are non existent and don't even train the employees. The employees them self sit in the break room longer than they actually work. You get no help or support from the bosses,1,Former Employee,Dairy Stocker ,"Alpine, MI",9/12/22,2022,9,12

"Don’t work here, they’ll drain every ounce of happiness out of you",This place expects way too much from its employees.

Don’t get stuck here. ,1,Current Employee,Deli/Bakery Associate ,"Hooksett, NH",9/12/22,2022,9,12
Mediocre work place,There are times management is horrible and they will overwork you and they don't always treat you fairly if you are pregnant or have some kind of disability. Customers are ruthless. It's okay if you just want money and can handle a stressful busy work day but if work stresses you out like that wouldn't recommend ,3,Current Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,Idaho,9/12/22,2022,9,12
Doesn’t care and need to be careful ,"It was ok, fired me because they revoked my approved days off months after I took them, which I used to take care of my mom, played favorites and made you pushed carts even if you are a cashier, don’t care if you had a doctors note",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Fresno, CA",9/12/22,2022,9,12

Coworkers will either make you stay or leave,"It's Walmart, don't expect much. Management is a complete joke. The store manager makes you set up appointments a week in advance to even speak with her. They will work you to almost death and then when you decide to speak up, you will be retaliated against. No one in management ever knows what they're doing, You will be told 5 different explanations for one task and you better find a way to do it all 5 different ways or they will have something to say about you.

Toxic,I worked as an overnight stocker. Understaffed and to much work expected. Management had unrealistic expectations. The team leads were supportive but upper management was non existent and unreachable to the overnight shift. If you called during the day to talk to someone good luck. No one was available or called back. It was a running joke. The attendance policy was inconsistently applied. The work itself was not hard but the overall work experience was not good.,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Old Saybrook, CT",9/12/22,2022,9,12

Lacks team work and unhealthy work-life balance ,They have a very low turn over rate because management likes to play detective and micro manages you. They only pay 12 dollars which is absolutely ridiculous considering how much they expect from you. The customers are super entitled. My favorite line (in my head) is: if you can't afford Target or Publix don't come to Walmart expecting that experience ,1,Current Employee,Front End Cashier ,"Oviedo, FL",9/12/22,2022,9,12
Low pay,Great coworkers. The stock options were great. The pay was low and the supervisors were all friends of the store manager and not good choices for supervisory positions.,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,Georgia,9/12/22,2022,9,12
"Family oriented, very respectful. ","I always felt like walmart had my back if I was having issues. They always explained in detail what they required from you. There was never any confusion.

Just another corporate cycle ,"Many people testify to the fact that Walmart employees look miserable and true enough they have poor work management. Their staff are made to work like robots and treated without any respect and dignity. They pay their employees poorly and mostly keep their part-time to avoid paying them benefits.

Aggravating every shift,The customers I usually interact to are nice although sometimes they aren’t which is to be expected. It’s the employees I usually have the problems with. Upper management takes sides of the people they know personally which is unfair for other workers who don’t know them. Honestly just biased regardless how good you are. Then there is the lazy workers who you have to work for but they take credit for what they do. Some shifts have to do positions that aren’t even yours. Workers are just rude regardless if you are nice to them. The job is fine overall if you can deal with associates. Personally going to transfer jobs at this rate. They honestly don’t even teach you properly they just have other people do that. For the people they teach favor them for no apparent reason. Have to know upper management before applying otherwise you won’t be having the best experience. Still better then fast food however  ,2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lehighton, PA",9/12/22,2022,9,12
steady work,"Work was always available and scheduling was not flexible, if you were schedule to be at work, there was no forgiveness for requested time off.

The environment was fun too. Over time like most jobs and not careers thing gradually went downhill. I had been prepped to move up for almost a year and I worked very hard and went above and beyond where I could thinking I was proving something showing I could step up to be a leader. Eventually I lost the managers that supported me and was tossed aside like my hard work had not mattered as they picked another person from a whole different store and department to lead our department and take the position I was running for.,3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Jackson, MI",9/11/22,2022,9,11

Unprofessional and unorganized ,"I worked there for about a year and four months give or take. In this year management would see drama arising and egg it on. Getting pto only squires after you’ve been made full time and your requests can still be denied. The point system is very blunt but the management will pick and choose whos points they will take off and others they fire. There are blackout days where they just won’t accept any time off requests and give double points for arrival or lack thereof. There is no chance you’ll be off around Christmas or thanksgiving, even smaller holidays they won’t give you off.

Extremely Complex Work From Home Job - Unjustifiably Low Pay As Well,"I trained as a home based customer care employee. The social aspect was stressful both fitting in with the team being trained, the management, and continuous IT challenges to the equipment working properly or not. The multiple pieces of software used could have been made into a proprietary program for Walmart but instead, Walmart took the cheap route  with multiple pieces of software that don't integrate, a huge database with a million rabbit holes to chase down answers to customer questions, and stretching management very thin to where I had to ask the same questions of my team leads over and over again in the span of a few days. To me the sum total was a nightmare of inefficiency and all people involved stumbling around. I had to get go of the position but the kicker was this: After 5 weekdays of stating in emails to my TL's that I was no longer an employee, I never got a helpful  email containing shipping lables to print so as to send the home office equipment I had received back to Walmart Central. I also called the employee support line to get the answer to this, but after 10 minutes they told me ""all you can do is get with you TL on this, not us, we're not supposed to speak to non employees"" and ended the call by hanging up on me!",2,Former Employee,Customer Care Agent ,remote,9/10/22,2022,9,10

There is favoritism in the workplace they put you to do other job duties because there isn't enough coverage and customers get mad because you don't know that area. by the time I left, they were barely training the new employees and most of them were underage. coworkers were nice enough, but sometimes when you needed a CSM they were nowhere to be found.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Downey, CA",9/10/22,2022,9,10

Yet they would get to leave early for the dumbest reason.  (No truck night) when instead they could be helping us get caught up like we had to do for them daily! Also doing OTHER departments freight, if you even get to be on the salesfloor.  Forced to cashier, work in OGP, departments you have no knowledge or training in. Pick up after 2nd and 3rds garbage they leave all over the place...And at the end of the day, asked why YOU didn't get YOUR responsibilities done!  Associates and management not knowing how to do certain things, so you would get a shoulder shrug and ""find someone else"" response.  I wonder how the place stayed functional on days i wasn't there to be honest!  Managers do NOT care, they just hang out in groups outside smoking.  Favorites would become managers and barely show up to work, leaving us that still linger on with ""hope"" things would change, nope..just 100X harder on YOU.   The way people could stand around in groups and just talk, sit in the bathroom or breakroom all day on their phones, or even smoke in the freezer.  Management just would shrug it off.

To be expected ,"OGP is made for someone who is fast on their feet. It can feel at times like there is too much pressure to perform well to have the numbers look good for corporate; when sometimes it's almost impossible. Example: you get stopped by customers all the time and it'll effect your pick rate, it's just not out on the floor and there isn't really any training on how to actively find things in the back room. Management isn't too bad there, questions will get answered. Also, if by chance ogp is slow that day they will put you in another department where you have no training in and not tell you how to do it and leave you for hours.

In my top 2 favorite jobs,The management was always friendly and willing to help you succeed. The tasks that were given were always straightforward.

Drivers are respected and home time is weekly in some locations daily,Regional operation Southeast. Mainly drop and hook. Learn how to inspect tractor and trailer fully to be successful daily.

Terrible policies and management team,"When I worked at walmart they hired me to work in one department. that same week different managers and team leads were telling me to run all over the store doing this and that. I was told by multiple managers and team leads that I listen to them and nobody else but nobody really knew what they wanted or what was going on. The store always had pallets in the middle of every single aisle and it seemed we were always behind even though the people that I worked with all tried our best to catch up on everything for them, they never seemed grateful. The management always had an attitude when we told them it was time for our lunch and would try to tell us we only had 30 minute lunches when we had hour lunches. The work overall was really demanding for the pay we were receiving. They also had us working full time hours but wouldn't give us the full time benefits. I recently went back there after a while and everyone that I knew had left but the store is still a mess with the pallets all over the place.

You get what you put in,"If you wanna advance your career with Walmart, you have to work for it. They offer free school after 6 months for certain degrees which is more than worth working for over spending thousands on student loans.

Calm environment,"Unfortunately if one area is understaffed, they will pull you from your area to help the understaffed area.

"A great place to start working, but not as good for long-term growth","I worked at a store in Mooresville, NC for a little while and I do have some pros and cons. Some of the pros I have are that I often am never bored and had something to do while I worked as an Online Order and Delivery Associate. A lot of the co-workers in my department were pretty friendly, supportive and helped with showing you the ropes. My cons however really have to do with management and the many strange events that occured around the store that they didn't properly prepare us for. My first three weeks my managers nor my team leads came to work which left me to learn from observation and became sort of aimless some days. As for the strange events, there would be times where we would have shootings, predators, and other unsavory customers appear at the store. Those issues also become amplified due to their being no manager or team lead there throughout the day. ",3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Mooresville, NC",9/8/22,2022,9,8

Terrible management ,"Horrible human beings, all of them. I wouldn’t wish a job there on my worst enemy. Unfriendly and rude people. It doesn’t matter how hard you work or how productive you are",1,Former Employee,OGP ,"Nitro, WV",9/7/22,2022,9,7
Loved the job just not management ,"I worked as an online grocery associate, i.e.. gathering and bagging items for online orders. I LOVED the job itself, as it was mostly independent work and very fast paced, so shifts went by quickly. It took some getting used to and memorizing where items were to really get the hang of things, but it was a breeze once you had it down. I got along well with some of my coworkers, but there were also some that were not very welcoming and still never warmed up to me after months of being there, which was a bummer since we all worked closely with each other at different points each day. Management however, was very hit or miss. They were accommodating and understanding with me personally, but seemed sort of clique-ish and I could tell which associates they didn't like, which I felt was very unprofessional. I left for personal reasons and a recent move too far for commute, but I would have left because of management if my other reasons weren't there. I know there is a lot of pressure put on supervisors and team leads, but towards the end, they seemed to get very short with people and would make problems out of little things. Bagging items for instance, we were no longer allowed to talk to other associates while bagging near each other, and would be reprimanded for doing so. It creates a very uncomfortable work environment, as I am very social and it had extremely little to no effect on my work ethic. The job itself was already very isolated, so bagging was one of the only times we could really speak with our coworkers. I'm completely on board with addressing productivity issues, but - more...",3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Westerly, RI",9/7/22,2022,9,7
"Good, then tough","I worked as a pharmacy technician for 8 years with Walmart. It started really well when I had a great Manager there. He was helpful, thoughtful, and always tried his best for the staff. Walmart started to change their ruling, be more strict on hours, and when our manager moved, it was tough. There wasn't a manager that would stay and often we relied on the pharmacist that was on duty. When hours were taken down, the staff struggled more, and it seemed like they wanted just as much high productivity with minimal amount of staff, which by profit makes sense; however, that means customer service went down and staff happiness diminished. Almost everyone I started with, left, myself included.",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Santa Maria, CA",9/7/22,2022,9,7

New startup with little ownership ,Walmart has a serious problem with ownership in their distribution/fulfillment centers. Managers are being hired with a nice sign on bonus then stay a year and move on. The company is growing really fast with little direction from upper management.

Fkwalmart a reasonable example of this is a family member of mine works for walmart for 22 years attempted to force retire the individual told them they would give them a $10,000 severance and a lifetime discount card and that when they're severance ran out they could always reapply as part-time so that the company corporate walmart didn't have to pay that employee the rate of pay that they had earned or any further benefits which in turn drove that family member into such a deep depression it caused them to have a stroke and die!

its a job,"If you just need a job and don't care about low pay, poor communication, broken equipment, little to no real training then walmart is place for you. they hire anyone with a pulse who can pass their bs assessment test (tip: only choose strongly agree/disagree nothing in between)  there is no incentive to care about doing a great job or being loyal to walmart. show up, do what your told, leave when scheduled. don't worry about going above n beyond cos then they expect more from you while slackers do less and get the same pay n benefits. There is no bonus or raise for providing fast service, keeping the store clean, or being friendly to customers. even when customers swear to never come back you will see them their next week so you always have job security regardless how friendly, clean, and fast you workemployees with experience whose been loyal to walmart for 10+ year make the same OR less than newly hired employees.

Not that good of a place to work,"Meat/produce stockers make the same pay as much as all the other stockers but they worked around the whole store. You have to work fruits/vegetables, milk, eggs, meat, and all of frozen. So basically you work around the whole store. I had to do all of this by myself most of the time because the only other person they had working day shift didn’t show up or didn’t do their job most of the time. Also, you have to go in the freezer and make your own pallet which takes around 20-30 minutes as well. It’s a lot more work to do than other stockers who just make a pallet in the back room and stock 2-3 aisles and don’t have to go in freezer or anything. Also, since all of the food goes out quickly, you have to scan the item you’re stocking and put a date on it. Other positions don’t have to do this. If you’re gonna work here I would recommend working for a different position otherwise you will just get paid unfairly.

They want you to stack boxes about 10 ft high, so after lifting heavy boxes over your head all day long you get pretty tired. The pay was great though plus plenty of overtime opportunities, excellent benefits package. If I ever work there again I'm going to try to get on the equipment so I don't kill myself working to exhaustion. There is opportunity to move up and it could be a great starting career.",5,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Chino, CA",9/5/22,2022,9,5
It's a job the benefits are okay but they work you hard,"I worked for Walmart for a couple of different times in different roles, stocking and cashiering are the hardest and most physical jobs and my body cramps up a lot because of it. Walmart is great when you need a job though",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Everett, WA",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Unorganized,I hate this place it is poor staff and unorganized and expect to much out of you for the pay rate. The management is very rude and it is so messy I'm looking for a better job.,1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Montgomery, AL",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Easy enough for the pay,"For $15 an hour it's a really easy job, only having to shop items or load items into people's car. Alot of people are lazy, but you meet people from all walks of life. Management does almost nothing we mostly manage ourselves, no raises what so ever either",4,Current Employee,OGP ,Amarillo ,9/5/22,2022,9,5
It is a productive job you also have a chance to move up in the company,You will have you will have to learn how to multitask and also work definitely apartments to help out when needed you will also be trained in different departments,4,Former Employee,Produce department and meat department ,"Washington, DC",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Hard work it’s a two person job for working as a stocker ,But I like the job I had I just dislike how of the managers would let u do their jobs knowing your doing your own job but anyway I liked my job I enjoyed the customers n I just enjoyed helping ,5,Former Employee,Stocker ,"North Lauderdale, FL",9/5/22,2022,9,5
over worked not enough pay,"fired for getting into a car accident and them not letting me go back to work, and not going on leave, while having internal bleeding everywhere. managers have no clue how to run things. I would be doing things they were meant to",1,Former Employee,Walmart personal shopper ,Florida,9/5/22,2022,9,5
Don’t be too ambitious. ,"Someone with a strong work ethic, who’s always ready to learn more and promote up, offsets the balance of the slacker community, and intimidates the upper management. They will do anything they can to coach you out of a job, just so you’re no longer a threat to their management position. ",1,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Lakewood, NY",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Simple work and good pay,Enjoyed working here! Who you work with and for makes all the difference. I was lucky and liked every one of my bosses but I did meet some from day shift that I would not want to work for. ,5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,Ohio,9/5/22,2022,9,5
Bad management ,Half of Management doesn’t care and throws  other managers/associates under the bus. They don’t care if you get sick or if something serious happens outside of work ,1,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Bloomington, IN",9/5/22,2022,9,5
"boy, oh boy ","i worked at walmart for a total of 3 days and the first three days i was so excited to start this job! i mean it only hardly pays a livable wage but i think the best part was when no one trained me and i got left behind. literally. i walked up to so many of my “coworkers” just for them to ignore me and make me feel embarrassed and stupid. my team lead didn’t even care i was new either. i walked around for 3 hours looking for at least one employee that would make contact with me, having a full blown panic attack when NO ONE would train me. no one would walkey anyone for me. i literally just got left behind and not one single person gives a heck about you in this store. they only care about their out times. i would 110% suggest you find a different store to work at, just not the jackson michigan one on Mich AVE",1,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Jackson, MI",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Could be better,"Working as a Personal Shopper is a great job to do, however only when the store got it together, but when inventory counts are off, because stocker can't get trucks unloaded on time, it puts digital shoppers in a bind. It causes us to not be able to pick orders in time contributing to bad merits and production rates, even though these numbers are affected by what the cap teams do, yet management still hold the digital department accountable. ",3,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"South Hill, VA",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Ok,It was a fun work experience overall but the customers are rude depending on where you work. Other than that the other employees were pretty cool and my managers were always fair. ,3,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 2 Associate ,"Lithonia, GA",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Never enough staff,"Walmart is running itself into the ground. It only cares about making money, they do. Ot care about employees or even customers. They will ask you what they can do to be better and then do the opposite. ",2,Current Employee,Odp ,"Dunn, NC",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Management treatment poor,Managers at Walmart treat you poor. They talk down to you and show poor leadership skills. They rule over their associates with a iron hammer. It’s sad when you dread coming to work just because of one manager. ,2,Current Employee,Associate ,"Port Charlotte, FL",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Bad management,Bad management like many places in the valley. Firat week i had a coulle managers raise their voice at me and jad a couple verbal altrications. People in power thinking they own the world.,2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Alron gloor,9/5/22,2022,9,5
"Ok to work,  horrible mgmt","Great Co workers and ok company,  if you want Part time. Not a secure future and little benefits given.  Management very hard to deal with.  Lots of politics and incompetence. ",3,Former Employee,Loss Prevention Officer ,"Phoenix, AZ",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Productive,Experience at this Walmart has not been good.  There are certain things that can improve.  There is not much employee friendliness on the job.  Others Walmart’s seem to be better.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Milton, FL",9/5/22,2022,9,5
It's somewhat easy,Understaffed as always and learn as you go. But it's easier than construction. Starting wage isn't bad. Most of the time you are stocking items and helping customers out. ,4,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Sandy, UT",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Cool,Expect to do more than what was originally guaranteed to you during your interview. It depends on if work is overflowing (from the job being unstaffed).,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Jacksonville, FL",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Don't.,"It's Walmart. You know it's bad, but it's easy to get a job and stay there. The downside is generally management. If you get into a position they find you competent at, it's almost impossible to move out of it. I had multiple transfers blocked by my manager despite being qualified for them.",1,Former Employee,Meat/Produce Associate ,"Country Club Hills, IL",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Great place to work ,I wldve loved to stay but the pay and hours just wasnt enough  i had to find another job im gonna miss walmart                                                     ,5,Former Employee,Automotive Cashier ,"Dinuba, CA",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Not bad for the pay,Pay is better than most retail places. The breaks are nice and the different jobs they offer are relatively easy to get the hang of. Management can be iffy. Politics run strong amongst some of the long term employees and management.,4,Former Employee,Stocker/Maintenance/Personal Shopper/Department Manager ,"Saukville, WI",9/5/22,2022,9,5
busy,"A typical work day is very busy. I learned all aspects of management and went for training. Always opportunity for advancement.

very hot outside,"I was a cart pusher at walmart for about 3 months and i could not keep going, it was about 105° outside almost every single day. ended up switching over to cashier and that’s going good so far",3,Current Employee,Cart Pusher ,"San Antonio, TX",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Production and management ,Overworked and manager wants and unrealistic amount of work done everyday. Even though boxes require two people to lift because they are over 80 pounds you still have to do it on your own.,2,Former Employee,Receving Associate ,"Mira Loma, CA",9/5/22,2022,9,5
Very boring,"Here we had to work 3 different shifts basically and the work is all by yourself, never with anyone. If you like working alone it’s perfect but other then that. I’m ",3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Statesboro, GA",9/5/22,2022,9,5
"It’s a very easy job, not matter what part you work. But they expect a lot of one person ",Walmart has easy jobs. No matter what part of the store you work in it’s easy. Management plays favorites. They don’t hold anyone accountable. They are people pleasers so nothing gets done during confrontation. They pay well for the location but you sell your soul and you sell you free time. ,2,Former Employee,Manager/Cashier/Customer Service ,"Litchfield, MN",9/5/22,2022,9,5
"Long days, Hard work","The days are long varying what shift you take. interview process was easy and they gave you a helping hand and a translator if you needed one. For me, i went in as a Shipping loader which means you will be loading trailers all day. The workload can get stressful and hard. You will start out with one lane in training and work your way up to 3. Sometimes you'll get 4 lanes if need be. when the warehouse is understaffed you might get 6 maybe 7 depending on what is going on that day. the slow season sucks as you may be sent home early or can volunteer to go home early. people are friendly but the pay is not worth it. if you want to break your back working you can (physically and mentally as the way they want you to do the job can actually throw out your back. i did it twice). you'll be required to lift up to 100+lbs, but you can always ask your coworkers for help if they are able. a lane will get around 500-650 boxes an hour on a hard day, an average of 450 on a regular day, and a little around 300 on an easy day plus or minus a few. the days are mostly hard so don't expect to see an easy day often, and the average day is what they consider average. The pay is not worth the workload. If you are over 6'0"", i suggest staying away from shipping as you will hurt you back as you will need to bend over at almost a 90 degree angle just to reach the boxes. Overall though, the people are great to work with and depending on what shift you take, you get a lunch break. at least when i was leaving they still had it around, apparently it was changing when i left and they made it as two 20 minute - more...",2,Former Employee,Shipping Loader ,"Bentonville, AR",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Sylva walmart is an aweful place,Don't waste your time unless your best friends with a member of management. Advancement opportunities only cone to those who are shown favoritism by their friends in management. ,1,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Sylva, NC",9/4/22,2022,9,4
"A Good Starter Job, Definitely Move On Though","I worked as a pt cashier (now a ""team associate"") for 2 different super centers and 1 neighborhood market spanning from 2019 to 2022 (on and off).The centers were by far better than markets, especially if you want time off.Management at all 3 were terrible, no one knows what they're doing or never there.Culture is a joke unless you're a favorite, related to someone or a higher up.Customers will make you hate humanity, and the crazy things you'll see..I can't even explain.Walmart in general has gone downhill since the pandemic. I hope they continue closing for holidays and add more to be close on.They can sometimes be nice and offer free donuts, desserts and candy in the break room for special events or holidays.",3,Former Employee,Team Associate ,"Oklahoma City, OK",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Not Worth it ,"Overworked and underpaid! Great first place to work but not good for long-term position, the managers are unorganized, the hr is rude, and the store is a mess!",3,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Brenham, TX",9/4/22,2022,9,4

Walmart was ok to work there I have no problems with Walmart ,I worked at Walmart for a little over 2 years the ladies I worked with where fantastic to work with I was an online shopper from store to home . The bad they put anyone in charge an when have a problem that don’t like to listen ,5,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Pottsville, PA",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Okay job ,Good pay - no work life balance. You can move up in the company easily. Job security as Walmart is never going out of business. Overall a good job for someone with no family.,5,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Charlotte, NC",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Management was horrible ,At first I liked it. After being there for only 4 short months I’ve witnessed supervisors talk to us like we were nothing! The eye rolling and blowing their breath when asking for any help or concerns u may have. Humiliation in front of other coworkers. There was no one on one! They will straight bully people outta of a job if they don’t like you! This is at the Neighborhood  Walmart in Lawton Oklahoma! The upper management does nothing to help! It’s the overnight supervisors! Good luck working here ! They can’t keep a good team at all and the good workers they did have walked out or just never came back! I’m one of them! Will never recommend this place to anyone! Glad I’m gone!,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Lawton, OK",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Awful ,I'd give management  and work/life balance negative stars if possible. Regular mass layoffs and demotion based on nothing.  Hobbled by ludicrous policy ,1,Former Employee,Pharmacist ,Florida,9/4/22,2022,9,4
Terrible management ,I honestly enjoyed working here because my team of coworkers were great but there were some managers that played favorites and treated employees unfairly which was the main reason I left. Cashiering is pretty easy but the customers are not always pleasant to work with. Sometimes they would move me around to work in the customer service desk or as a door host which I didn’t really mind. They will cut your hours and then call you in to work because they need people.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Self-Checkout Host ,"Pasadena, TX",9/4/22,2022,9,4
"The managers suck, got accused of stealing something that I already paid for ","Tried to work in electronics; got along with everyone, pretty much. Then, as usual, I went to leave and Loss Prevention came and wouldn't let me leave. I previously paid for the soda and had to wait until I could find the person that was at the counter when I paid. They had me in handcuffs... so I quit My new job is the best.",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Turnersville, NJ",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Good job to have if you don't want to take your job home with you.,"Good company to work for.  If you're looking for advancement, they have numerous opportunities.  They have good benefits to take advantage of.  If you just want a job to do then go home without it on your mind, then Walmart is the place for you.  They have flexible schedules as long as you give three weeks notice.",5,Current Employee,Apparel Fitting room associate ,"Kendallville, IN",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Amount of stress was too much,"Working the closing shift at the deli, my team and I were responsible for cutting meats and cheeses for customers, handling any orders at the hotcase, and then closing at the end of the day which includes activities like cleaning the slicers, disposing of trash, scrubbing dishes, etc.  It was simple work that was easy enough to do when you had a crew to work with, but often enough, other members of the shift were not there for one reason or another. Usually that's not a major issue, except that Walmart would continuously increase their demands of our department, and several others, despite a lack or hands to do the work. Even if I were the only one that had showed up to work, I was expected to do the work of an entire department. Any time I voiced my grievances about it, I was met with the same ""we have to work as a team"", or ""we just have to pull through"" schtick even though there was no team several times. No one cared, and no one appreciated the work that did get done despite a lack of staff.",2,Former Employee,Walmart Deli Associate ,"Saint Peters, MO",9/4/22,2022,9,4
