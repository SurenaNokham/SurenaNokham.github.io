Productive and professional,I really liked working for Walmart I just don’t like that I haven’t been able to go back yet because of the process with Sedgwick on my maturity leave but overall it is a great experience working for them.,5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Orlando, FL",6/28/18,2018,6,28
Poor rating,"Poor working environment with little to no effective communication.   Hours given to associates vary weekly so one week you may get 40 the next you may be scheduled 5, in order to prevent associates from achieving full time status.",1,Former Employee,Photo Specialist ,"Murfreesboro, TN",6/28/18,2018,6,28

productive and collaborative work with occasional customer interactions.,"I mainly worked as a stocker for Walmart during the night shift. Because Walmart is open 24/7 this meant I was also working customer service, which took a priority whenever I saw a lost customer or if a customer came to me. There was a bit of friendly competition involved in stocking isles next to one another, but helping each-other or working together happened just as often as racing through your own assignments near each-other. The only place that was particularly difficult to stock was the make-up isle because several items were either not labeled or mislabeled so there was a lot of manual searching for minute differences in that one particular isle. Otherwise it was an enjoyable collaborative work environment. I always enjoyed helping out customers, and if I couldn't handle a specific task for whatever reason (sometimes that being a purchase from the gun section that I didn't have the proper authority for, or when I had to get a table from the back for one couple and I got some extra help to move it and bring it to them) I could always get help from my fellow employees and we could help out the customer by the end.",5,Former Employee,Associate ,"Galena, IL",6/28/18,2018,6,28
Its ok,I liked working at walmart at first . I liked the paydays but then it got stressful. they had me doing everything its a great job just not what i wanna do,3,Former Employee,Shoe stocking ,"Logan, WV",6/28/18,2018,6,28
Standard cashier situations,"Most co-workers were easy to interact with. Customers were, on average, nice and easy going with the occasional rude group. Management was decently helpful but would not try very hard to work with the employee when some personal situations happen.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Saint Joseph, MO",6/28/18,2018,6,28
Management will kill you,"When I worked at walmart it started all right. I enjoyed the work itself and the pay was not to bad. I didn't like the night shift but thought that I may move out of it one day. But the managers are what got me, every time I got used to the instructions they had given me a week or two before they changed them, usually without telling me until I was in their office receiving a stern talking to.",1,Former Employee,Fresh Produce Technician ,"Woodland Park, CO",6/28/18,2018,6,28
would love to stay if pay was better and I could get a good schedule,"I think Walmart would be a great place to work if they paid employees better. I liked my job, but I worked really hard and felt I deserved more. I think if they would take better care of the associates they wouldn't have as big of a turnover. When I first started, I worked in the deli, learned how to slice cheese and luncheon meats, cook chickens and the other foods on the lunch bar. I went to the meat department after a year where I learned the cuts of meats, how to stock all the fresh meats, luncheon meats, seafood, and breakfast foods. I also worked in the bakery off and on, learned how to bake the breads, ice cupcakes, bag and label everything. When I moved to Jacksonville I worked in a Neighborhood Market, very different, but enjoyed the slower paced atmosphere. I was in 3 different departments, meat, frozen and dairy. One manager to head all 3. I was part of the inventory team, which I learned a lot about the separate departments. I helped open both stores I was employed with, that was the fun part, learning where everything belonged and all the other employees. I worked in Niceville and Jacksonville",4,Current Employee,Associate ,"Jacksonville, FL",6/28/18,2018,6,28
rough work,moved counters from one place to another. learned how to move counter. putting wheels on counters was the hardest part of the job. best part was the hour lunches,4,Former Employee,Remodel Associate ,"Olney, IL",6/28/18,2018,6,28
Stressful,Working at Walmart was not stressful because of the customers or fast-paced environment. It was stressful because management had no idea how to do their jobs.,2,Former Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE REP ,Virginia,6/28/18,2018,6,28
Day at walmart,"When you get there to work its already a mess in general as far as not enough associates for the day. Customers standing around looking for help when you know managers are their but they don't try to help. Schedules are never prepared for the days going forward. It is always a lack of unprofessionalism with Walmart and how we treat our customers before even getting to them. Which what i mean by that is how long they wait for help, which is around 35 to 50 minutes in areas we just don't schedule people in regardless if management is told about it. When it comes to leaving on time you never and i mean never leave on time. Its fine to get overtime if your getting paid for it but at Walmart you don't get overtime hours. So you practically working for free, while they tell you to stay but then tell you the next day to cut the time you stayed over. The only great parts about Walmart is the 10% discount you get there and the sales associates but manager wise they need a lot of help.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lockhart, TX",6/28/18,2018,6,28
Great place to work if you are looking for hours.,"I was only there for 3 months, a temporary employee. But while i was working there i enjoyed it. Pay was great.

Great people. Confusing Management,"I am friends with a lot of my co-workers which makes it an easy place to work. I find it very fast paced and sometimes very stressful which is alright as the day usually goes fairly quick. I find management very confusing at times and the rules/ guidelines handed down from corporate don't always make sense. I feel there are other, more efficient ways to get a job done but we cannot use that way because it isn't what corporate wants. Overall it seems to be a decent starter job for young adults. You can easily make it your career. For me however, its not my career choice.",3,Current Employee,E commerce Personal Shopper ,"Meridian, ID",6/28/18,2018,6,28

Declining Associate benefits,"Over the years I've worked for the company, the hourly pay rate has increased gradually. The other benefits have reduced at a quicker rate.

To continue showing growth of the company the associates benefits have been on decline",3,Current Employee,Receiving Inventory Associate ,"Cullman, AL",6/28/18,2018,6,28
Walmart is nothing like it used to be,"I worked at Walmart for several years as a Cashier, pharmacy tech, and vision tech. When Sam Walton ran Walmart it was awesome. Now all they want to do is  force the long time employees out the door.

Free snacks or Lunches  for Safety,"Working for Walmart was a challenging experience overall very strong Company . The managers all  need more consistency all managers never want to be liable for the mistakes play games mind games fact   for the leadership they have been selected .

WALMART is a huge corporation they have billions of dollars to make huge mistakes this is a known fact . Your own co-workers will stab you right in the back just to please the Management . And when it comes to the Walmart cheer assembled from management . Team work there is no such definition of that at all .

Shoe shoes everywhere,As Department manager in shoes it was a store within a store. I had two employees that I supervised.Great ladies!

Great for a job; bad for a career,"Inconsistency in policy enforcement, and the unwillingness to provide consistent, full-time hours is deplorable. Your mileage will vary, of course, as every store plays by its own rules. If you don't intend on a career in retail, but you need some cash, walmart will take all comers. Their disciplinary system is one of disallowing promotions should you be actioned in any way, which can happen without warning or consistency as the things one manager may tell you could go against another, and all of them have power over you simultaneously. I was very lucky to be directly beneath good managers, but the crooked ones still had all the power they needed to ruin any hope of bettering my situation, which has left me jaded and disenchanted._x000D__x000D_Look for something better in the meantime.",3,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Yelm, WA",6/28/18,2018,6,28

Ok but tiring job.,Never had problems with customers or coworkers. Managers depend on some employees more than others. Employees who get paid the most should do more work and have more responsibility than newer people but they don't.

if you have nothing else,if you really need a job. i guess walmart is your only option. i worked at a pretty bad store. not saying i had issues with the people there. but everyone knew the store couldve been run better and more efficiently. guess i joined up at the wrong time. the store manager ended up getting fired anyway. also everyone around you also hates their job. so its not all bad. you all know you have bills to pay,3,Former Employee,Truck Unloader ,"Lakewood, CA",6/28/18,2018,6,28
Great coworkers but terrible management,Honestly I didn’t want to leave but basically the members of the team I was on were  mistreated by upper management. Me were understaffed and expect to work twice as hard to cover the fact that we were understaffed. Normally we should have atleast 6-9 schedualed to unload a truck but it got to a point were there was only 3. Management didn’t simpathize with us the just degraded us and mocked how “slow” we were going. I didn’t expect much being a Cap team 2 member but it felt like I was a slaw not an employee. The only thing that made it manageable was my fellow associates.,3,Current Employee,Unloder ,"Spartanburg, SC",6/28/18,2018,6,28

Not Recommended Unless Other Options Are Unavailable,"Working in retail for many years, this job was evidence that not all of it is created equal. Management was very cut throat, and contradicted each other on numerous occasions. Direction was never given clearly and surprised popped up on a regular basis. As a result it was very easy to end up in trouble for things that were completely arbitrary. Not recommended for most people unless in desperate need of a job. The pay is not good at all, the expectations are extremely high despite this.",3,Former Employee,Electronics Specialist ,"Buena Park, CA",6/28/18,2018,6,28
Excellent all around,My time at Walmart was a great experience. I enjoyed the work environment and I enjoyed the labor itself. I started off as seasonal and got hired in the deli.

Having an hour for lunch so I can go home to eat.,"I either work at 7,8, or 11 am,  If I work at 7 am I usually help the donut maker or start on bakery mark downs for the morning.  After that I might be stocking on the floor or help the baker package up today's baked product.  If i work at 8 am I would be stocking on the floor.  If I was working at 11 am I would be getting the breads and pastries out of the freezer and pan them up for the next days round of baking.  Also that means you would be doing all of the closing duties as well.  I have learned while at Walmart during this stage of my 25 year retail career to learn to bake, make donuts, make sub sandwiches and deli trays.  For me it is easy to get along with all of the managers at my store.  I can see with the hard work that I do why I get the best reviews each year.  I think it is easy for anyone to fit in.  We can now where blue jeans again, with our colored, flowered, or striped kind of shirts.  The hardest part of the job for me at my age is not having the same or steady hours each week.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people who I have made friends with during my time with Walmart.",4,Current Employee,Baker ,"Rapid City, SD",6/27/18,2018,6,27

Great place to work .,A typical day a Wal-Mart consisted of me conducting a store tour and ensuring store management and associates are executing policies and procedures properly. Investigating Shrink or integrity investigations. Ensuring a safe work and shopping environment. The past 25 years has taught me that most people perform more affectively if you manage them with a positive attitude and not by intimidation. The culture of Wal-Mart is still alive and well and is talked about prevalent everyday. The hardest part of my job maintaining a good performing store for 12 months. Keeping it on the right track. There's nothing more gratifying than having a store make it's inventory target. Wal-Mart is a great place to work. However I'm  I feel very underpaid. I made the same amount of money 10 years ago and need to make a change for my family.,4,Current Employee,Market Asset Protection Manager ,"Albuquerque, NM",6/27/18,2018,6,27
Stressful work environment and understaffed,"While working at Walmart, I had to work 14 departments on most days with 6 other associates other days by myself.  The only thing I learned there was how to multi-task efficiently.

Work hard for a long time with no real opportunity to advance,Management was always watching and coming down on employees for anything at all. You couldn't be a minute late and they would get bent out of shape. The pay moving from cashier to lower management was less than fifty cents with all the responsibilty of running the front end of the store and accounting for every employee that worked on the front lines. They would not allow you to work full time hours because they fought to keep you from getting insurance and benefits.

Dissapointing,"For the first year everything seems to be great. I think only because its new and you don't know what to expect or what is going on. There is a huge lack of accountability with associates and management. Communication is terrible. Multiple Managers telling you different thing to do . There is no team work.

You end up doing the work of 4 to 5 people. feel under appreciated, taken advantage of and underpaid._x000D_"" Lip Service"" is what you get when you go to management with an issue if any sort.( probably because they're over worked and underpaid too).

They hire supervisors from the outside, so they really don't know the business. Team Leads are sought out by supervisors since they don't know how to do anything.

I've learned that Wal-Mart is a very stressful place to be at and is not worth being there.Management was poor as they had favorites and had all there favorite employees unload the easiest trailers for them to make their quotas for the night. the people I worked with were pretty good but it did seem like we would need to fight each other  just to be able to reach our quotas and it felt like you can't trust no one there.

Secure job with good benefits if you can stand the clientele and management,"A lot of people do not like Wal-Mart for a lot of reasons, some true, some not.  If you get hired, you can be sure that your job is pretty safe if you perform up to expectations and show up every day, and you get yearly raises.  You also get 2 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch if you work an 8 hour day.  The benefits are good, although the insurance is getting worse every year.  You also get 10% off everything but food.  However, if you can't handle being yelled at, cursed at, spit on, threatened, demeaned, and insulted on a daily basis, this job is not for you.  Some of the customers will make your day and will become your ""regulars.""  This is the enjoyable part of the job.  Others, about 25%, will treat you like garbage simply because you work at Wal-Mart.  You will be made to feel like you are the most ignorant, worthless piece of trash, simply because you did not move fast enough, or have something in stock, or the price was incorrect, or was more than they thought it should be.  I loved all the areas I worked at in the store, but after 13 years, I just couldn't take the abuse from customers and the spineless management any longer.  There are some good managers, but they are few and far between, the majority are just puppets and will bend over backwards to avoid any sort of ""confrontation.""  This includes allowing people to return items at the service desk which were used, soiled, and sometimes not even purchased at Wal-Mart, as well as allowing customers to make threats to associates.

Great benefits ...horrible management team,It’s a good place for the benefits you get but the management team is terrible.  It’s days where you ask for help and instead of helping they call you or take 30 minutes to respond and that’s if they respond.

Pretty good job.,"Not to much to say. Co-workers and managers weren't easy to get along with and work kept you busy so days didn't really drag on. Only complaint is it's hard to get full-time status and very few benefits for part-time employees. Even if full-time have to wait a full year for medical benefits. Discount card was a pretty nice perk though. Overall not a bad place to work, just maybe if they took a look into how long you have to wait for medical benefits (1 year for full-time and 2 years for part-time) and didn't make it so hard to move from part-time to full-time status.",4,Former Employee,TLE Service Technician ,"Mineral Wells, TX",6/26/18,2018,6,26

Wal-mart is great at time,Walmart was a great place to start working and I believe that it was a great experience to have. I enjoyed the job for the most part and I think the Walmart gives great opportunities to grow if you can stand to work there for longer than a few months.

Terrible place,"My time at Wal-Mart was the worst of my life. Constant stress, low salary, poor management. Associates are constantly pressured to do overtime with no compensation. Health insurance is only available for full time employees (which you have to go on a waiting list for) or part time if you have no sick days for a YEAR. I don't know what else to say. Just awful.",1,Former Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"San Tan Valley, AZ",6/25/18,2018,6,25

Good for a first time job,Overall Wal-mart isn't as bad as most people say it is. Once you work there for a while the benefits available are amazing and definitely worth your wild. The hardest part about working there is the people. If you can make friends with your manager and coworkers then you'll be good to go. But if you get on their bad side then they will not help you unless you are begging.,4,Current Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Littleton, CO",6/25/18,2018,6,25

Management was horrible,"I worked at Walmart for a year and a half. The only reason I probably stayed was because the pay was decent, the hours were pretty good, flexible schedule, and the people were great. Management on the other hand was something else. They made me feel as if they didn't care about all the work I'd put into my job and I was easily replaceable. My own department manager acted like they didn't know how to do their job and I was constantly having to pick up their slack and fix their mistakes that made our customers upset. Even on Black Friday, I worked Pick Up Today and it was horrible. They didn't put anyone to work, I was stuck with all these orders and no help. Assistant managers passed by like they didn't care. Due to that I had to leave, it was getting hard to deal with along with college. It was so stressful.",3,Former Employee,Cashier Customer Service ,"San Antonio, TX",6/25/18,2018,6,25

Good company. Bad management,Easy work. Tiring when busy. Decent pay nothing to complain about. If you work a full 8 hour shift you are scheduled for 9 hours of work because you get a full 1 hour lunch which is a blessing and a curse. 2 15 minute breaks. The hardest thing about working here are the customers can be difficult at times and management can be hard to work with they will hardly listen to your complaints or concerns will pick favorites over you and won't do anything to make your stay as an employee an easy one if you get on their bad side. The best thing oddly enough are also the customers who are amazing and come back often to see you as well as awesome co workers that you befriend.,4,Current Employee,Self Checkout Host/Cashier ,"Chicago, IL",6/25/18,2018,6,25

Good company to work for if you don't mind working late and doing most of your work without assistance from management,Some managers never come to help you regardless of how many times you call them. SCO hosts are not supposed to leave SCO area but sometimes there is no choice but to leave and search for a manager because the customer needs immediate assistance and no one comes. Sometimes associates have to stay late to put up returns (most nights an associate has a large cart full of merchandise to put back on the shelves). A few associates are plain rude and will not help other associates if they have a question. Some of the night shift associates blame the day shift associates for their work load when some things are out of our control.,1,Current Employee,Self Checkout Host/Cashier ,GA,6/25/18,2018,6,25

A wonderful job ruined by middle managers,"The position I held at wal mart was overnight fresh associate, it was a simple job that became complex and untenable by obstinate and dishonest support managers that on their own could not give you an honest answer about scheduling, changes in work requirements, or even dress code changes.

It was a job,"Can be a great place to work at but as a recent graduate of a degree in management it is not managed very well, at least not where I worked.

Biggest slap in the face ever.,1,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",6/24/18,2018,6,24
Not a very fun place to work,Needs better management as there are managers that don’t allow PTO in their own standards even as the employee works the hours needed yet still can’t get approval for time off.

The management was very highschool when it came to if they didn't like you.

Terrible long term job. Great for temporary employment,"If you're looking for a long-term job, I would hardly recommend working as a Cashier for Walmart. While pay is somewhat decent and benefits like discounts can be a huge help, a large majority of your time spent in store revolves around managing difficult interactions with hardly any proper training. First day on the job had me watch a few hours of educational videos about the company's values and history. Then was immediately sent out to the sales floor to downstock/put away items from truck. No prior training. Little help from exhausted co-workers. Just sent to the wolves immediately.

Inconsistent Management Biggest Downfall,"Very demanding physical job with the frequency of working merchandise both in shopping area and warehouse storage area. Seems like no matter how hard you try to keep the department organized, well stocked, and tidy, it is always destroyed by numerous messy customers. It is very stressful and difficult to take pride in your work when customers mess it all up after you just spent many hours organizing and cleaning. And when you try to keep it that way, your managers just want you to work inventory that needs to be stocked and it's alright to let the department look an absolute mess. Yet you get told over and over that you need to keep the department looking good. You just can't seem to win, all while being understaffed because others are frequently calling in sick, yet able to keep their jobs. You witness day after day many empty packages of the remains of stolen merchandise. Having to deal with a majority of extremely rude and difficult customers on a daily basis is extremely stressful too. This is the most stressful, unrewarding job I have ever had in my 38 years of employment in numerous places and careers. Oh, and the training is very minimal. You watch a video one time and they expect you to remember it all.

Working at Walmart,"At first I enjoyed my job, but then I began to notice our company runs on a lot of favoritism and poor management. You have to be someones favorite to make it far in the company and when you aren't on that favorite list they pay attention to only what you do wrong and nothing on what you do right.

Not a bad place to work for beginning retail,"The job itself wasn't bad, but you had to be quick to learn on the spot because the training was really poor. I worked in various sections in the store and they didn't teach very well regardless of where I was stationed.

Good work for what it is.,"Walmart has a lot of options for the kind of work you'd prefer to do. While it can take time, moving up is possible. If you work hard enough within your probationary period, you may find yourself on a full time schedule sooner than expected. Walmart offers programs for people to move up through applying for manager positions in departments, support, or assistant manager programs. The benefits are a bit of a disappointment. While dental, vision, and life insurance options are very affordable, health coverage is not very good with having high deductibles and very high out of pocket costs and costing a lot per paycheck to enroll. Management can be a give or take, but as long as you do your work, you will get along with management, mostly. There are some members of management that can be somewhat rude or overly assertive. Being able to balance work and life is actually very convenient. I am able to make any request off days I need, and choose whether I want it to be paid or unpaid time off. Full time employees earn a good amount of paid time off hours for each pay period. Walmart is very much equal opportunity for all people to get hired. Walmart will give everyone a chance. One thing I especially like is having a full hour lunch break. Things to keep in mind: Thanksgiving and Black Friday are required work days, you cannot request off or call out on those days, you will risk being terminated.",4,Current Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Warrington, PA",6/22/18,2018,6,22

Cashier,CSM were mean to me. They yelled at me across the floor and in front of customers. Not all CSM followed the same rules. CSM's had their favorite associate that they let get away with talking and cutting up. Were in my case if I spoke to another associate I got yelled it. Management were just as bad. They only listened to the CSM and never your side. If you looked off from them to look at something else you were rolling your eyes at them. The hardest part as trying to get alone with the other associates. There wasn't a enjoyable part of this job. I was afraid to go in to work on a daily bases.,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Anderson, SC",6/22/18,2018,6,22

Abysmal workplace environment. Stay far away.,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker Associate ,"Sumter, SC",6/22/18,2018,6,22
Dont even go here,"Wal-Mart's culture has changed dramatically over these last few years. It used to be about inclusion of ideas and associate benefits, but it has changed in a manner that is very much against the associate. Long term employees did not receive an hourly pay compensation when Wal-Mart raised its wage to 10/hr. they just got a small bonus and years of hard earned raises were all for nothing. It's policy culture has changed to one that is ""values based"" instead of a rules based policy approach  to make it easier for company management to find an associate guilty of something they didn't even do! Associates are treated more like objects than people and the management team culture is one of secrecy, non-transparency, and that they are ""better than"" most associates. The management team isolates themselves and forms a friendship based bond with each other so that even if a manager does something wrong they never get into trouble for it. Double-Standards permeate the work environment and direction is given on an ""Because I said so"" basis. Associates are not recognized for their work and are rarely praised for a good job. It doesn't matter to Wal-Mart how long you have worked with the company or how good your reputation is at your store, you are still treated as completely expendable and replaceable._x000D__x000D_Nowadays, Wal-Mart focuses so heavily on payroll being their most ""controllable"" expense that they are eliminating jobs at a furious pace, offering only part time positions with very little benefits, constantly changing jobs and their availability without regard to whether or not there - more...",2,Former Employee,Backroom Zone Manager ,"Marshfield, Wisconsin",6/22/18,2018,6,22

Would only recommend as a last resort for anyone over 25,Unless you're applying to a manager position (if it's above department manager) and/or if you're younger than 25 or just really need to work; I'd say steer clear from this company. I've seen and dealt with upper managers trying to degrade employees and even disrespecting the elder associates. Don't let them take advantage of you just because you really need a job and keep in touch with the human resources directors (off site). You have to educate yourself thoroughly with the policies because I've seen and have had to deal with PTO (personal time off) issues. Ex: you put in months in advance in the system and on paper in the office and then since a change in workflow happens it's rejected months and even days in advance. Just be cautious and I wish you the best.,1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"San Antonio, TX",6/22/18,2018,6,22

Management was alright the only thing they lacked was proper communication. A typical day at work can be stressful but at the end of the day I survive. Hardest part about my job is trying to get all the cake orders done in time especially because there was always either one or two cake decorator. Kind of impossible to finish 30 plus orders with only two of us. But besides the hard part I loved working with the girls in bakery it was work environment but it was also fun.

Relaxed,"This job has its good days and bad days. Management was typically hired in-house, so almost every manager understands the stresses of each job.

The managent is ridiculous and needs to be reevaluated,The management staff needs to be re trained on how to treat the staff and customers. And needs to hire somebody to do there returns in a timely manner. I;m surprised no one has sued them for getting sick off some of the food thats being put back on the shelves. And for inadequate security inside and outside of the store. Some of the employees are so rude to the customers,2,Current Employee,Money Center Cashier ,"Atlanta, GA",6/21/18,2018,6,21
Needs work,Needs improvement on how to treat employees and make them feel like an asset to the company. I was a great employee there but I never really felt appreciated. Management talks to the employees poor and sometimes we have to endure unfair treatment. I loved doing my job because I was good at it. The best part about Walmart is being able to help customers. I love helping people!

Decent First Job,Walmart was my first job at 18. I started off in grocery then bounced around as a floater through multiple departments before landing as a front end cashier.

"Poor management, stressful, paid bread crumbs","Working at Walmart in 2013 was worse than I thought it could ever be. Not only was the compensation barely above minimum wage, they expect the workers to take on several different higher-paying roles without any option of a pay increase. They were eager to work around my school schedule at the time of hire, but after that, they would not stop scheduling me during my classes even though they were provided with my schedule. The members of management were constantly in conflict with one another and would blame the employees for acting in accordance to another manager's requests. The kind of stress that alone brought on the associates was not worth the pay. You were lucky to get a break on time, even the pregnant associates that were doing the potty dance after not being able to take a break for 4 hours.",2,Former Employee,Multi-skilled Associate ,"Oklahoma City, OK",6/21/18,2018,6,21

Location decides quality,"On a daily basis we handled at least a hundred customers, as well as keeping the shelves stocked and the store cleaned. Management would at times over work the staff, requiring associates from one department to cover for call outs in others as well as man their own departments. The workplace has a relaxed atmosphere and the staff does work together.

A place to get stuck at,"If you want to bring your occupational growth to a halt, work here. If you want to waste months or years of your life, work here. If you want to be surrounded by un-interesting people in the break room, this is the place.  _x000D_ _x000D_There is a mixed message with what you are taught in your 2-3-week isolation period on the computer and what is expected and experienced on the floor. The management style at my store was an old school negative fear-based type. Most employees had to worry that if they did not get their work done they would be warned, then possibly on their way to losing the job. Never are people complemented on what they do well. Only reprimanded for what they should have done better. Also, one frequently gets reprimanded for things that others do wrong. Many of my co-workers experienced this as well so at least I knew I was not singled out. _x000D_  _x000D_The store is open almost 24 hours a day. 0600 - 2400. Not reasonable hours like 9-9 or 8-6, 10-8...etc. _x000D_ _x000D_ _x000D_I'm going to stop there, though I could say more. Why not 1 star? It was not always bad. Most customers were great.

Productive place to work,"A typical day on the job included a meeting in the back room with the shift manager and all of us.  Usually the meetings were productive and helpful, on occasion they were used to berate or yell at the entire team for some failing or other.  After the meeting, we were dismissed to our assigned areas.  For me, that included helping to unload the truck, and then go out onto the floor to my assigned stock area to work freight that came in that day.  Customer Service was also a large part of the job, as you answered questions all the time from customers looking for different products.  Most of the time, you would lead the customers to where those products were located.  Pulling liquor out of the cage was the most stressful part of the job, as the customers in that area of the store tended to get fussy and impatient.  I remember one particular day when there were seven people waiting for assistance at the liquor cage.  I wasn't allowed to use a shopping cart to get everybody's requested drinks, so I had to carry a few at a time to the register where they would be waiting for the customers at the end of their visit.  Because I could only carry  few at a time, some customers would get angry if you didn't take their selection on your first trip.  This resulted in a few instances of customer abuse when they followed me to the registers and yelled at me the entire time.  I once threatened to return said customer's selection to the cage and refuse to sell it to them.  Overall, Walmart is a decent place to work.",4,Former Employee,Customer Services Representative ,"Pittsburg, CA",6/21/18,2018,6,21

Lack of comunication,"I would recommend working here if you enjoy having to explain yourself several different times to several different people. I was fired from this job for taking time off for maternity leave, because my supervisors and the managers did not communicate. I was still being put on the schedule, even though one of the managers knew i was off for maternity leave. The other manager saw that i was skipping my shifts, and therefor fired me. If the two would have just communicated, then this problem probably wouldn't have happened. Other than that, working here isn't that bad.

Walmart,"Walmart would be a great place for people with an open schedule. Management is not helpful and they are never around when you really need them. Schedules were always an issue and turn over rate was always high. You get quarterly bonuses only if there were no major accidents and met the quota. How much the bonuses would be is based on how many hours a week actually worked and sometimes, might not even receive one. In the pharmacy, you don't really get breaks and lunch is not very long. The customers can be very demanding and if you do not have strong customer service skills then I strongly recommend finding a different job. Its a good company to get some type of work background but as far as a career, there is not that much opportunity on moving up. Walmart does provide 401k and retirement opportunities as well as reimbursements with traveling. They provide paid training, your badge and smocks. Required attire is out of own pocket.",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Lockport, IL",6/21/18,2018,6,21

Good company but inconsistent,"Depending on the location, you're either going to love Walmart or hate Walmart.  At my location, problems seem to be fixed with bandaids and eventually spiral out of control.  The Store Manager won't speak to associates directly when he sees something wrong, which sets a bad example for the other managers as the standards are being set from above.  The Store Manager will also lie or act like he's in denial when a problem is brought up, offering little to not solution to the table.  It's a very disheartening thing to see when you have a mind set on improving things.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Gardendale, AL",6/20/18,2018,6,20

To many managers,"If a good manager is working the work is more relaxed,  the poor ones just hide all night than panic when work not completed.  They measure your work in hours and expect you to complete 8 to 10 hours of work in 5 or less.  The good managers will watch and check you to see if more help is needed and rearrange work duty so jobs are completed.  When more than one manager is there they each try to tell you what to do contradicting each other and disrupting the job you are doing slowing you down in the process.",3,Current Employee,Maintenance and Stocker ,"West Plains, MO",6/20/18,2018,6,20

Was Good Til I Got Sick,"I personally loved working at Walmart. I loved the people and the work. It wasn’t hard to do and others made it clear what they wanted done. I do believe that people should get another chance at Walmart after they get fired for something like occurrences. This is why nobody can get a job around here. I think if someone worked hard then management should at least think about it.  I was working, trying to go to college, and taking care of my dying mother all at the same time. It was difficult to do everything and still be on time to work. So I stopped going to college. Then, I lost my job at Walmart.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Covington, VA",6/20/18,2018,6,20

Leadership Summary,"Most senior level leaders spend majority of their day in back to back meetings, most are non-productive with no agenda or meaningful outcome.  In the past three years, most of the leadership empowerment culture has been removed, resulting in delays and lack of value and appreciation for experience.  The company is transforming to a command and execution reform vs. one built on talent and expertise.",1,Current Employee,Senior Director ,"Bentonville, AR",6/20/18,2018,6,20

Ok company to work for but the bad out ways the good.,"In my 15 years with the company I have seen a tremendous amount of change. Every company has to change with the times. Technology changes. Companies have to adapt to these changes. I 100 percent agree. Walmart is growing at such a fast pace they have to constantly change procedures. Sometimes within months of the last change. We have to adapt to one change then once we have adapted they all of a sudden change it again. Which can be very frustrating because you just figured out this first change. It never stops. Managers in the company would rather bark orders at and say fix it instead of giving you a suggestion or explanation on how to fix it or why. Giving suggestions and showing how to do something is part of being a leader. Lead by example. I’ve seen in many cases, respect for the individual from a manger to an associate is something they should be ashamed of. You want respect you have to earn it. I love the company itself. I love my job but honestly it’s management that is pushing all the associates away. I have little kids at home they have activities and they expect you to change your life around with just a few hours notice. That’s wrong. Walmart always used to be about family. It’s not anymore.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"North Attleboro, MA",6/19/18,2018,6,19
Good,Walmart was a good company to work at. I learned a lot on how to approach customers if they were looking for a certain item. I learned to how to use a scanner so I can find the item/product. But overall it was a good experience working there.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Harlingen, TX",6/19/18,2018,6,19
Lack of communication skilld between managers and employees and other managers,When I worked there the management was poor and they didn't take the time to help improve employees work experience. They would write up employees who failed to finish work that sometimes wasn't even told they had to complete before leaving for the day or even given the task to do in their task to-do list. They would also give tasks that required an 18 hours shift to complete and only had one person doing it working an 8 hour shift.,2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",6/19/18,2018,6,19
"Great Coworkers, Awful Policies","With the recent introduction of multiple self checkout machines at my store, the pace of the day has gotten much worse. Corporate is out of touch with the customers and fails to understand that customers will flat out refuse to use the machines and will wait in long lines to check out. This causes a back up in the store and leads to stress on workers. To remedy this, they've cut hours in the hope that less cashiers will lead to more customers being forced to use machines, but that is not the case; they're just waiting in longer lines with more of a reason to explode in the face of the cashier who will then be less likely to want to stay with the company.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Waveland, MS",6/19/18,2018,6,19

Productive place with some bumps here and there,"Overall, Walmart is a great place to work, with friendly associates, good management, an often clean environment, and a lot to do. Most days go off without a hitch, but always be prepared for those crazy stressful days, weekends especially. Like any store, one of the biggest uncertainties is customers. Often they are kind and appreciative when you try to help them, but occasionally, you will get someone who is problematic. Working the customer service counter, you are told a dozen times a day about the restrooms needing cleaning, often mere minutes after the maintenance associate finishes cleaning the restroom. What customers are doing in the bathroom, I don't know. One of the biggest issues can often be staffing. A few days of the week, the store is staffed well, but on other days, there will be a lack of cashiers, customer service managers, cart pushers, department managers, etc. Holidays are never fun, especially Christmas time, because the work days feel neverending. First weekends of the month are also crazy, mostly because that is when food stamps are replenished and everyone comes to the store to go grocery shopping. Days are often stressful, but you will have a team with you who has your back and will help you through any obstacles you encounter.",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Fishkill, NY",6/19/18,2018,6,19

A great job... ONCE.,"Walmart Transportation was once one of the best jobs in the transportation industry, bar none. In late 2017, Walmart began making wholesale changes to the private fleet that disenfranchised most of it's driver workforce and which has led to a mass exodus of many of the drivers.

Terrible Workplace,Walmart trains their management to overload & under appreciate their associates. If an associate does a good job in their assigned area they are made to do another area on top of that with the expectation of one person doing the job of two without higher pay.

Generous Lunch Break,"I pick and dispense groceries for Online Grocery Pickup. I never know what I am actually going to be doing when I show up and they have changed my schedule many times since I started, but I finally have the same days off every week.

Walmart is a great place to work and learn new skills. You get time to interact with people from all over the world.,"I come to work with a smile on my face and I am prepared to treat the customers and associates with respect.  I have learned over the years that it is good to get know your fellow asscociates because without communication it can be difficult to work with someone. I am a firm believer in people working together on one accord and that is the same as teamwork. Management is an important position because you should get to know who your associates are and get an understanding of what particular task they enjoy doing. I feel that if you're working in an area where you feel happy and enjoy your job then that's a good place to be because you can maintain a positive attitude, and therefore the people around you are also happy. The hardest part of the job to me is having to deal with people that are disrespectful, and the most enjoyable part is watching customers and associates leave with a smile.",5,Former Employee,Money Center Cashier ,"Hattiesburg, MS",6/18/18,2018,6,18

Okay,"It was okay. Manager expects a lot of stuff even when there's not much that could be done. Manager are nice if you are on their good side.

Lack of training, absent management, temp associates watching Netflix instead of working but nothing being done about it, as well as signing a 1 year contract and being able to be let go just whenever (last time was 2 weeks after start date after working 12 hour shifts over the Holidays) Not a company I want to be a part of anymore.",2,Former Employee,TEMPORARY ASSOCIATE ,"Bentonville, AR",6/18/18,2018,6,18
I do not recommend working at Walmart.,"It's great that the company gives both full and part-time employees paid time off, and the starting pay is $11.00 per hour for all employees.  The coaching system, however, is unfair to employees because employees get accused of things that they haven't done and then receive a so-called ""coaching"" for what they supposedly did wrong, and after the 4th coaching the employee is fired.  This is a ridiculous system because the management is unwilling to do anything to verify whether or not an employee actually deserves the coaching; so employees can collect ""coachings"" and get fired for very frivolous, unfounded reasons.  I don't think that some of the managers are very good at managing, including some of the upper level managers, such as the store manager.  I think that they only got into those positions because they worked their way up to get there, but they actually lack the skills that a good manager should have.  I do not feel like I was ever appreciated by Walmart when I worked there either; I was treated like an expendable employee when I worked there, and I have heard NUMEROUS current or former employees say the same thing about working at Walmart.  Also, cashiers frequently did not get their breaks on time, but management never seemed to care about this either. I would not recommend working at Walmart to anyone, unless he/she is not able to get a job anywhere else after spending long hours looking for one and applying for hundreds of jobs.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rome, GA",6/18/18,2018,6,18

People are driven to do retail reconciliations,"Learning about retail and how things flow in the store, it’s amazing!

"stressful work environment, poor management","A typical day for me is I open, make tills, distribute the tills to the entire store and wait for my first cashiers to come in.

If you open, you usually don't get a first break. _x000D__x000D_As a Customer Service Manager you have to deal with both the customers and management. Management will not come to help you most of the time if you bust your butt and do your job. Since you're a supervisor, you're expected of more which means you don't have a good work-life balance since you're always working (no 2 days off in a row). Good luck juggling time with your family.

Needs Improvement,"I have worked for Walmart for nearly a year and it is beyond difficult to not just quit. My coworkers are amazing but managers barely seem to care if there is ever any kind of issue. Departments are understaffed and management never schedules enough people, leaving the rest of us to pick up the slack. When bringing this up to the managers, nothing is done about it. This also causes me and other people in our departments to constantly deal with angry customers for something that isn't even our fault purely because not enough people were scheduled- if any were for that department at all. The only thing keeping me from quitting are the benefits and coworkers. It's sad.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cookeville, TN",6/17/18,2018,6,17

Managers sucked,"I worked Lawn and Garden in Carmel Indiana. There was a cash register I had to guard. But I couldn't stand there all day so I had to make myself look productive. So mostly had to lie and look like I was doing something. ""Zoning"" is the term Walmart uses. One manager always demanded I go to the back to get more stock. I'm actually a hard worker and can do stock in a matter of minutes as I worked at an insanely paced Walmart before. Of course, he didn't know I did all the stocking in less than 20 minutes and would just assume I did nothing for the past 3 hours. I would tell my fellow co-workers I was getting stock, then of course they would all leave. Then I would get yelled at when I came back with stock. That's when I decided I had enough. I thought I was being hired for part time but they hired me for full time. Why didn't I hear about it? Because it's one of those ""urban"" Walmarts where everyone is cackling and having a good time, of course doing nothing, and taking 3 hours to do a half hour interview, then it all gets quiet when some kid from out of state asks a question. It was a very ""different""  Walmart with the managers and human resources having a very different big-city mindset. It took them a while to change my schedule. Everyone was rude, most of all the managers and the customers, who were the worst part. It's a rich town with lots of old, rich people who look down on you for working at Walmart.

They send cashiers to do customer service when it’s busy but we don’t get paid how much customer service workers get paid . Very unfair . They leave frozen food out for a long time before they put go backs away . They are very unorganized and messy . They lock everything up so you spend your whole day unlocking stuff for customers .

"People talk smack about Walmart, but I thought it was a good place to work","I worked as a cashier for two summers during college. Both times, my experience was positive. Walmart pays well, and the management attempted to make everyone's requests for time off work. There was a strong sense of teamwork.

It's Retail,"It was a relatively good job. The standard issues that arise from working in retail are of course there, (dealing with unreasonable customers, not having enough employees at any given time, apathy from corporate, scheduling issues) but the benefits were good and your hourly wage would go up every year as long as you did your job well.",3,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate ,"Delafield, WI",6/15/18,2018,6,15
Balancing act...,"I have been at this store for over ten years. I have seen the changes for the Store Manager go from near complete control over operations to micromanagement. This has been a terrible flip. Our staffing is cut, the supplies are cut, needed positions are denied, the ordering is limited, and overall moral has suffered tremendously. We have a horrible turnover rate and the staff we are hiring today are pretty much bottom barrel. We have so many accidents in our store that our bonuses are near minimal (again, training). The Home Office has all but destroyed our sales and customer service approach, and our ability to succeed due to following the scheduling and training of our Associates. There was a time when we were proud to do our jobs. Now, we do what we can to avoid getting yelled at or ""coached"". It is so sad that it's come to this. Most of us want to succeed in our work and customer service, but the limits that are put on us prevent this from fruition. Arkansas, let us do what we do.

walmart,the people that work for walmart make the store. the actual managers and the company of walmart itself does not care for the associate. There is very bad communication going on between the steps of management. Its very stressful.

Nice place to work,"Overall, my experience was good working there, until I transferred to another location. Management was poor there, with the exception of 2 assistant managers and 2 Support Managers. Management weren't knowledgeable of running a successful store. I can honestly say, that I knew more about merchandising and running certain departments more than the assistants. I was held to the ""high expectations"" of fixing what I've fixed over and over again, again.Most of the associates were young and immature, so they walked around on their cell phones while the few of us (hard workers) did our job. Management also show favoritism. The store struggled to get on process, because of inconsistency. Probably still struggling.",2,Former Employee,Cap Team Supervisor ,"Memphis, TN",6/15/18,2018,6,15

I think it could be better in management at the home office,Walmart is a good company but the upper management at the home office typically doesn’t know what is going on in the store so if any problem happens they call the store let them know the problem they just come n start firing or taking away bounce from upper management and demoted employees instead calling n fix the problem from the home office,5,Former Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,Virginia,6/15/18,2018,6,15

Deplorable,"I'd be better of as a homeless vagrant than I would a Walmart associate. Even though I was full time at Walmart, I would say that's the only thing there really worth my time. I picked up other people's slack due to poor management on their parts. All I learned there was how greedy and hateful management was towards their own associates. After all I've had one manager tell me personally that he cares more about money than the associates or the customers that bring in that revenue and had another manager blow up on another cart pusher stating that he could be replaced any time the manager wanted. I don't even know what the poor guy did to deserve that but that manager got fired a few days after. As for the culture of the place, the atmosphere of Walmart is so grim and hateful that you could cut it with a knife, so I'd say that the hardest part of being a cart pusher at Walmart is just coming into work each day. I can say for sure I will never work there again. And from my customer's point of view, I won't even shop there if I can help it. I can never find what I'm looking for. No one is ever at their station which causes me to have to search for a half hour or more to ask a simple question like where a specific type of cheese is. And the filthiness of that place!

TLE is supposed to open at 7:00am which means when we come in at 6:30am we have to pull all the tires out for display before then. but sat around most mornings till about 7:30am with angry customers because we were waiting for somebody in management to come and unlock the bay doors.

The Real Deal,"You are going to find all the things present w/ a salaried position that you could find in a professional setting and in an hourly blue-collar setting.

From an Area Manager's perspective (beware of Walmart),"The new leaders within the company are convinced that the only way to compete against Lidhl and Aldi's is to be unrealistically efficient. By the way, Walmart no longer fears Target or Amazon as much as they do Lidhl and Aldi's. _x000D__x000D_Walmart's new senior leadership (read: CEO, CFO, General Managers, Etc.) is/are trying to squeeze as much efficiency out of their distribution centers as possible with a cost of losing their most valuable asset: their employees. They are setting production rates so high it is almost physically impossible to achieve. _x000D__x000D_To compound the issue, folks are being held accountable (read: written up) for not meeting these production rates and you can only be held accountable so many times then you'll be fired. To add insult to injury, senior management are utilizing too many people in certain areas, thus causing everyone else not to be able to meet their production goals (upper management, have you never heard of the term 'law of diminishing returns'?) And guess what, these people are held accountable even though they had no control over their production numbers (self-inflicting wounds, wouldn't you agree senior Walmart management?). _x000D__x000D_Furthermore, as a manager, I was required to go on a witch hunt every week to find someone doing something unsafe and write them up.

They don’t care.,"IF you get a decent store, (which most of them aren’t and have terrible store side management as well) it’ll be helpful in making it through the long days if you’re a manager. However, even more rare is good market management as they are cowards who at the end of the day don’t care about you, have a (you or me) mentality so if their bosses say, “we are restructuring, get rid of managers,” they pick whoever they want despite how well they perform; and they don’t specify the exact reasons, as to avoid a lawsuit for falsely letting you go.  And your severance agreement is basically a gag order. So, good luck as they change and restructure every year in some form.",1,Former Employee,ASM ,"Joplin, TX",6/12/18,2018,6,12

Relaxed workplace,"Work at Walmart varies from intense to boring during a day.

Later at night there tends to be little to no coverage and that is usually when we got the onslaught of customers coming in just before dinner/after dinner. We'd have about two regular lines, the Tobacco line, and then the self-check outs open. Stressful doesn't even begin to describe the day to day activities. Management is very rarely willing to jump on the registers, nor does their ""Open-door"" policy mean anything. Great hours... sometimes. Other times, you are lucky to get any.

The store I worked at was plagued with problems and we had more than our fair share of managers come and go, including three different store managers. Of all the managers that worked there, I can think of maybe three that seemed like they cared about the employees.

On certain days there would be a truck to unload and I would go retrieve the freight and work it while marking it off of our prenotification sheets. Usually at this point I'm the only employee in my section from about 5:00-10:00, but that just depends on who made the schedule.

"Poor management, doesn't work well with other schedules, felt like I was alone everyday","I worked at Wal-Mart for a year, 6 months as a cashier, 6 months as a garden center associate. I really have no complaints about being a cashier. However, as a garden center associate, all kinds of issues arose. My management completely ignored our needs and our suggestions for product care. Immediate management didn't care about the plants. They would give us at least 6 hour-long projects, for an 8 hour working shift, then complain to us about how we didnt get projects done. Meantime, we were understaffed, trying to take care of usually 3 to 4 customers at once, trying to get these projects done, answering phones, running a register, while still trying to do general maintenance and organization of our department._x000D_I also was working another job. I was regularly getting 32 hours, but by the last 2 months of working, I was lucky to get 5 hours a week. What could I do to fix it? ""Open up availability."" Even though I discussed with them about my second job, and my available 40 hours there, it still was not enough. If I wasnt prepared to give my whole life to Wal-Mart, I wasnt getting hours. It was not a pleasant experience.",2,Former Employee,Cashier / Garden center associate ,"Chattanooga, TN",6/10/18,2018,6,10

They broke me,"Being with the company for 9 years, I worked in a total of 6 stores. Each transfer was due to a promotion or because I was asked to because the store I was going to needed the help. I found one thing to be consistent in each store, which was they all had the same problems that the last had and the hourly associates were bitter and angry with management.  As an assistant, I quickly became the one that everyone went to when they needed help because I always followed through on my word and took care of my people. I was verbally reprimanded for this on a daily basis. Salaried managers are only focused on getting notes done and burst into a panic to do things the right way 20 minutes before important company visits. Associates are left with pending requests for time off and incorrect schedules due to management not completing their administrative tasks. I, personally, was berated daily for the laziness and neglect of my fellow assistants and Co-managers. There is little to no sales floor training and then associates are held accountable for doing tasks incorrectly or not meeting the time limit. I had to work hard for 5 years to get to the position of assistant, only to find out that my direct manager had been hired in off the street because he had a degree in leadership. He had never worked for the company and had no idea how the daily operations where supposed to go. Often times I would find him sleeping in hidden locations throughout the store, or in his car.

The pay is not worth the trouble. This job puts a lot of stress on your body. Even if you are a hard worker you do not get converted any faster than the ones that barely work.

Now just a paycheck. Walmart culture was cut to save costs.,"I've been with Walmart as a driver for 28 years.  The first 27 years I was proud to work there. The company made me proud to work there.  You always had to work hard to meet their goals but there was incentive to meet those goals. As a new driver I was willing to put in the very long hours and sacrifice the family time because I knew that if I did, there would be a long term benefit. They had a large collection of programs that let drivers get home to spend time with their families, once you had accrued seniority.  Set runs, where you ran the same route every day, grocery set-runs where you ran different stores but still got home at night, 5/3 programs, where 3 drivers shared two trucks and you always got the third week off while the other guys had the trucks. Many other programs._x000D_    This spring they cut all of those programs to save costs. Now everyone drives the same schedule. You just leave out on different days. Don't expect to get weekends off until you have been there at least 15 years. They also changed the programs for 3,000,000 safe mile drivers. They no longer have a dedicated truck. Anyone can drive those trucks now. Most of those drivers have scraped their names off those trucks._x000D_    I don't know any drivers now who are proud to work for Walmart. It is just a paycheck now.  Still a decent paycheck, but it used to be so much more.

Every single manager will tell you to do things differently. They don't communicate with each other, ever, and sometimes they will tell you contradictory things within minutes of each other. One CSM will tell me to shut my light off and go to break, and 5 minutes later another CSM will come tell me to turn my light back on and wait for another cashier to come on and relieve me.

One of the best companies to work for.,This job is very fast paced and family friendly. It requires someone with good people skills and good work ethics.

friendly coworkers rude managers,I did not like working for Walmart at all. The management was very rude and proved many times that they did not care about their employees.

It's was ok working there. But needed more hours,So so work place. Kind of stressful during the holidays. More of a job for teenagers looking for a little bit of hours.

Horrible last resort job,"This is possibly the most stressful and most emotionally degrading jobs. Management is very disorganized  and have poor communication skills. Management is very unappreciative of its employees ,literally nothing can impress your managers and they will literally find anything to complain about.Manage tends to play favoritism towards shifts , making other shifts work harder, to compensate for lack productivity of other shifts, while at the same time getting paid the same amount",2,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Westerville, OH",6/6/18,2018,6,6

Great pay but too high pruduction standards,"very dangerous work environment, over worked for extremely high production standards, management could care less about your well-being as long as the job got done, there was a lot of favoritism with management who were friends with some of the employees, the hardest part of the job was the meeting the extremely high productions standards, the most enjoyable part of the job was the pay",3,Former Employee,Report any package discrepancies to problem clerk ,"LaGrange, GA",6/6/18,2018,6,6
Management does not care about you,I injured myself and management could care less. The pay is decent but the terrible hours balances it out. So you still make about what you would at minimum wage.,3,Current Employee,Hardware Sales Associate ,"Winter Haven, FL",6/6/18,2018,6,6
Walmart,"The people were nice, but we were severely understaffed, were not allowed any overtime by company policy, the six month temp policy is detrimental to those who are seeking longevity and the management (higher management, not lower) were consistently rude to employees.",1,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Lapeer, MI",6/6/18,2018,6,6
Not understanding when it comes to your health,"I was fired from here because I was admitted to the hospital. While hooked up to IV's and being scheduled for surgery, the only question I was asked was, ""why aren't you at work?"" I did everything I was supposed to in order to make sure I wouldn't get fired or build up too many points.

It all depends on the department and the management,"Working at Walmart really just depends on where and what you're doing. I work in the bakery as a cake decorator: I had great team members and a great department manager, but higher management sucked and we were always left to drown. Working in the fresh side is production: your day isn't over at the end of your shift, it's done when you're finished with your job, and that sucks when you have no coverage for call ins or from people quitting. Walmart as a company has great bonuses, benefits, etc., but your personal experience will really just depend on management and what department you're in.",4,Current Employee,Cake Decorator ,Idaho,6/6/18,2018,6,6
Decent pay Horrible work environment,The pay and benefits at walmart were fine but the environment is terrible._x000D_Managers and associates are hired quit or are fired on a weekly basis. this leads to increased workloads for others which leads to them leaving themselves._x000D_you are treated like trash there given more and more tasks to complete daily as your department loses workers and coached when you cant complete them all._x000D_if you Need the money its worth a shot but if you can go anywhere else stay away from walmart,2,Former Employee,Deli Sales Associate ,"Robinson Township, PA",6/6/18,2018,6,6
Amt,"I was hired straight out of college to be an assistant store manager at Walmart. The training they provided was amazing and I was really excited about starting my new role. When I arrived at the store it was a huge mess. The back rooms were overflowing with inventory and corporate kept sending things we didn't have room for. Some items were ordered but were continually out of stock in the warehouse. A few commanders were upset because they never made store manager and would purposely mess up the inventory. We worked many, many hours beyond our scheduled hours because we were salary. Our associates we hired never stayed long because they did not make enough money for all the work they were expected to do. I did enjoy meeting customers expectations and helping them with their shopping experience but overall Walmart is not a good company to work for unless you are lucky enough to be in Bentonville.",1,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Cypress, TX",6/6/18,2018,6,6
Going down the drain,The first couple of years were great. New management has suppressed job morale. Quarterly incentives have ceased as well as annual raises. Scheduling is a major problem as well.,1,Former Employee,T3 Trainer/Order Filler ,"Laurens, SC",6/6/18,2018,6,6

A little different for a Maintenance Technician,"Working weekend graveyard 12-hour shifts for maintenance was a little different...but work three days, off four...was great. Miles and miles of conveyors in the .Com building kept us busy with preventive maintenance. By the time you completed all of the machines in a month, it was time to start over. No maintenance management was assigned to ""shift 5"", so a crew of 5 technicians maintained the facility, over 100 forklifts, a Lan/Wan network and about six miles of high speed conveyors to keep the ""online"" distribution center working._x000D_I had to train for forklifts, but everything else was standard stuff._x000D_Management was odd to me because I had never worked for managers who wrote you up for minor work discrepancies. Nor had I ever been in a maintenance shop without illustrated parts breakdowns for the equipment. Ordering parts was a real headache._x000D_I had never worked anywhere that did not pay overtime for any holidays, and only paid overtime if it was mandated out of your regular schedule. PTO (paid time off) was supposed to compensate, but the jury is still out on that._x000D_The hardest part of the job was the 12 hour shifts, but it was nice when it ended._x000D_Maintenance is a fairly thankless job to begin with, but it was good to keep so much technical equipment running and making improvements whenever possible.",4,Former Employee,Maintenance Technician ,"Fort Worth, TX",6/6/18,2018,6,6

Management doesn't connect with employers,"There's an attitude that management is not at all concerned with employees, except as bodies.  They don't even hardly deign to speak to them.  And, if a customer wants to go higher with an issue, the customer service of middle management truly sucks, yet they want the emphasis to be on providing good customer service.",3,Current Employee,SELF CHECKOUT HOST ,"Indianapolis, IN",6/6/18,2018,6,6

Too much stress for not enough hours or money,The Job itself is not too demanding either physically or mentally however the 2 biggest issues with this company are the customers and the management. The management is often out of line or they believe they have more power over their employees or their customers than they actually do. The customers themselves are something that the company has no control over and I do not hold their actions against the company however I believe the words Hazard pay should be in the payment plan.,2,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",6/6/18,2018,6,6

Very productive workplace,"A typical day at work would start from clocking in, putting on your vest, talking to the CSM responsible for your department, and doing whatever is needed throughout the day. I learned that management will do whatever they need to in order to get the job done. The culture in the workplace kind of felt like a clique, everyone had their own groups. The hardest part of being a cart pusher is working in the different weather conditions, for example, working in a 90 degree day to working in 20 degree weather with snow. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with your fellow cart pushers and working with them.",4,Current Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Chesterfield, VA",6/6/18,2018,6,6

The truth,"The lessons that were taught on the CBL modules were not observed within the store. There remains an atmosphere of retaliation within the company. For example, if an associate called in that person sometimes faced having their hours cut. Or if someone used the open door policy, the gossip would spread throughout the store for days. And management made up the largest sorce of gossip. There was a feeling of managers gloating over associates failing or getting fired.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",6/6/18,2018,6,6

I didn't really learn much it was kinda like teach yourself. The management was friendly.,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Wilmington, NC",6/6/18,2018,6,6
Pretty much what you would expect.,They will not say it but will push you to work off the clock. Pay is low and almost never increases more than inflation. Most of the people who work there don't care and I don't blame them. They few who do care are incompetent or power hungry. Expect threats to your job to motivate you.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,NC,6/6/18,2018,6,6
Good job but lack in leadership.,"This company is great to work for but the store I am in has a few things missing to really want to make me stay.

There is such a lack of staff and so little appreciation for the staff on hand that the place is in a continuous state of chaos. You might find that many of the people you work around are good people. However, the management and the culture isn’t one of rigor, it’s one that points fingers.

Now Walmart has decided not to give overtime hours, leaving some pharmacies without an adequate amount of pharmacy technicians to complete the job, or at some times, no pharmacy technician present.  Those coming in the next morning are required to do the tasks that were not completed the day before.

Great when there are the right people in management positions,Great company standards by corporate. The standards just needs to be implemented more at the store level. There is a big gap between the way that corporate wants things to be run in a store and the way that they actually are. Some things are just a bit impossible with the tasks and expectations that are given. But most things are do-able and especially with the way that employees are treated are NOT what the company standards would be and that is something that needs to be addressed and rectified.,4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Detroit, MI",6/2/18,2018,6,2

Starting Pay $11/hr,"There is a lot to be said about Walmart. But the bottom line is if you are looking for limited/no time with your family and are willing to work late at night and come in the next day at the wee hours of the morning, this job is for you. You are expected to work every holiday and often long hours on those holidays. The Schedule Right scheduling system relies on a computer based algorithm to schedule associates. If you are willing to work anytime on any day, you will receive more hours than other associates who require a specific day off, regardless of full-time/part-time status. You are constantly expected to say ""yes"", regardless of the staffing of the day or your ability to perform certain tasks, otherwise you are labeled as one who is unwilling to be a ""team player."" The attendance, while you are allotted more unexcused absences than most companies, relies entirely on your relationship with your manager. A death in the family is excused, but only if that person was a mother, father, brother or sister. Once promoted to management, all of this still applies. While you are compensated better financially, you are ""on-call"" 24 hours a day. You will receive texts and calls on your ""days off"" and vacations that might not even pertain to you or your assigned area. When a new Store Manager comes in and does not ""approve"" of you for any reason you are forced to resign or transfer to another store, I have witnessed this with my most recent Store Manager. The starting pay is $11/he but, I do not recommend Walmart as a company to work longer than 6 months.

Dedication,"This company was a great place in the first 6 months of my employment. It provided me a place to gain experience and move around for flexibility to maintain my hours. Once I was over my probation period, things began to go AWOL. One week I would have 32 to 38 hours and the next, I would have 18 to 22 hours, but that is the way retail is. The management cannot make up their minds with a collective decision and makes it difficult to advance. This gives an employee with 2 months of experience the ability to take a high position which doesn't allow an employee with experience and dedication to go for the job. It seems as though they become invisible. Be careful what you do while you're on the job.

You are expected to stay at work sick by whatever means and go to the Dr after your shift or on your lunch break.I witnessed a dept.

"It's alright, starting out.","A typical day working stock at Walmart all depends on whether or not you're doing an early shift or a later one. You either open by helping bring in product off of trucks, and then run a quick-paced work day, or you come in to slow work traffic, and an even slower closing process. The people there are nice, but mostly all of the people I worked with were either there because it was all that they could do, or vocally despised their job and want to do more.

Though they will almost always refuse to work around any schedule confliction you will ever have, and eventually point you out and fire you for it. I went from working in the deli for three months to running the entire store four nights a week. The only hiccup is that they let the upper management do absolutely whatever they want, especially if they work third shift and nobody else wants to do that job.

At Wal-Mart, it is required for you to work 3 months before changing your position, but management worked with me. I made sure to inform them that I was very nervous to be a cashier at a very fast paced place. They advised me that I was going to be okay and if I needed to switch positions I could.

It was hectic and sometimes unorganized because of poor scheduling.  Working in big corporate retail,  has rules and regulations, that are sometimes counter productive. Keeping within the parameters of these rules, was the hardest part of this job, because different managers seemed to have different perceptions of just what the rules were.  That caused stress, but I learned to go with the flow. As far as the enjoyable part of the job, it was decorating cakes for little tykes and seeing their eyes when they picked their cake up.

OK place to work if you have no other options,"If you absolutely need a job and no other options then this is a good place to work for. However, if you have other options available then please look elsewhere. I've worked for 2 different stores at this point and each starts out OK but then true colors begin to show. Management seems to get worse with each newly hired one. Some of the management I think would sell out their own mother for something petty if it meant they were able to look good instead of working for a step up and the company allows it. A lot of the management will give preferential treatment, especially if they are friends outside of work with associates. Most of the associates are generally nice and friendly, but as with any work environment you have the ones that you need to be warry of.

"Seems fun at first, but management stinks.","I liked working at Walmart because I was able to talk to a lot of people. In the beginning, everything was great, and everyone seemed nice. After about a month I realized that the management was not kind and did not know how to run things in an orderly manner. Every day that I worked, my breaks would be long overdue, sometimes up to FOUR hours overdue.  Majority of the time, I would not get sent for my break until an hour and a half past time. They would claim they didn’t have enough people, but really it’s that they didn’t know how to use the people they did have to where everyone was treated accordingly. The ONLY thing good about working for Walmart was the discount card, but you can’t even use that for groceries. I would not recommend working for them—it is miserable. People who are below management level only stay there because they need the money.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rome, GA",5/29/18,2018,5,29

"Depending on who your supervisor is and what store you work at, a sales associate or cashier position isn't too bad most of the year.","The sales associate and cashier positions aren't too bad most of the year. During the holiday season, the job gets a lot more stressful. Depending on who your manager is, you may be required to accomplish the same things without extra help. My store didn't hire extra help until just before black Friday and only provided just enough people to keep the returns going back on the floor. There was not enough staff to keep the product on the shelves presentable and on the correct prices. I found this very frustrating and stressful. A lot of the department managers would step down because the job was too stressful for them. I had 5 different department managers within one year in the Health and Beauty department at the store in El Mirage, AZ. Two of them stepped down and transferred to a different department, one quit and one was promoted. The last one was still there when I was transferred to a different department. I personally would not choose to work in management at Walmart.

What I learned was everyone has a different motivation at work and its important to learn and get to know each associate to best guide and work with the team. The hardest part of the job was having to ""gently"" remind the team of the expectations on the floor and on the phone with our customers.  The most enjoyable part was hearing positive feedback from the floor.  My boss was the best.  He trusted me to do my job and he gave me valuable feedback I will always take with me. Part of my duties involved monitoring associate calls to make sure they followed the company's guidelines.  This to ensure our customers received the best service possible. We, as supervisors also made sure the floor was flowing nicely.  Every day was different!  I loved that.  I also worked the daily stats for the team to keep them informed on their goals.

Good beginning job,"Walmart is extremely strict and does not work with you about your health needs.  If you have any health issues, I do NOT recommend working for Walmart.  I love working with people and thought this job would be great.  When I wanted to switch to customer service, management kept telling me they'd switch me.  They did NOT send me over there very often to train even though they said they would.  When I would ask about it, they would say they needed me elsewhere and I'd often see someone less qualified be sent over there.  Then they hired a new person entirely for the position.  I always felt they try to figure out where you want to be placed and then keep  you from going there.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Sherwood, OR",5/28/18,2018,5,28
Walmart's changing ways,"Nothing is truly consistent at Walmart. The company is always changing: work hours, schedules last minute, job responsibilities. It doesn't seem like upper management is on the same page. Associates are fun to work with as well as peers. Accountability is hard to come by. If you know more and take on more responsibilities you aren't credited for it. More just gets added to you as an expectation. Asset protection the most enjoyable part of the job was investigations.

Your assistant manager makes the job,"The job can be either enjoyable or constant stress depending on who your assistant manager is. unfortunately even if you have a great assistant manager above you other assistant managers can still make your job a struggle on a daily basis. Avoid to many promotions or friendships, advancement is fast and cut throat. individuals will throw you under the bus for a promotion as well as pin things on you, once you get promoted they will ""test you"" by putting you in near impossible situations constantly to see if you will quit or if they can fire you for someone less experienced and asking for less pay.",2,Former Employee,Tire Lube Express Service Sales Associate ,"Fruitland, MD",5/28/18,2018,5,28

Soul suckingly dreadful,"Working at walmart is typically seen as one of the worst places to work and for the most part its not that bad. The problem arise from lack of support and no appreciation from management after being yelled at and treated like something found on the bottom of your shoe. You can try will all your might and be as nice and courteous to what are frankly the worst example of humanity and still be reported for something as simple as you didnt smile enough.

Inconvenient,"A person can try to have set hours, but management doesn't really understand what it means when a person needs a day off.  And if someone has to have a day off then all the others are expected to be alright with that person no calling/showing up for their shift.

Flexible Schedule,"My experience at Walmart was bittersweet. I came from a corporate office job to retail was a major adjustment. At first, the employees there were not as welcoming but they were eager to teach me what I needed to know to do my job. Often caused by a large turnover rate I understood that they were not as welcoming and they often tested my ability. But over time I became friends with these people as well as the customers. I did a lot of growing up mentally because of the high demands. The hardest part of the job was not the job itself but leaving behind the people that I became close with. The management was not terrible but probably not the best because how short staffed we were. The turnover rate for management was high because of home office demands and store demands.

For anyone that is out of high school looking for a decent entry job, Wal-Mart may be for you.  The work environment varies from slow and calm to fast and chaotic.

Jobs are very stressful and the management team is full of incompetence and they are willing to coach you on a whim for the slightest thing. The company has been trying to get rid of long term employees who make a lot in low tier positions because they are a ""financial liability"". Then, when you move up to management they take advantage of your salaried status and make you work 60-70 hours a week just to meet a project deadline because there are no hourly associates to help complete it.

good opportunity for growth but not worth it,The job in and of itself isn't hard I actually liked it a lot.

Great work experience helping many different people; great discounts for employees.,"A day working at Walmart will consist of being on time clocking in with proper attire, preparation such as stretching then beginning to work down pallets. Helping customers on their way to get different products is important so that they feel welcome to shop, and open to ask you questions if they feel necessary to do so. Management provides good ground work for training and they are typically very hands on with you when you start; slowly adding more tasks to your daily regimen. Working in Walmart you will learn the company from the smallest task to largest so you may be called to do any number of  things. Workplace culture is typically laid back so if you do you tasks on time you are guaranteed some level of rest during the 8 hour shift. Hardest part of the job is the stamina needed to complete the various pallets and movement of stationed products to their correct sales positions along with the operation of heavy machinery.

Worst Company For HR leaders,"This company is exactly what you imagine when you hear the word Walmart.  Walmart is so far behind in their HR model and if you are hoping to learn about your trade go someplace else.   The Sr Leaders in HR are not qualified to be in the roles they hold.  They are all best friends that came from Accenture.  They lack the ability to think strategically, influence, are totally disorganized and have no clue what good HR looks like. They just implemented the performance management forced distribution model- most companies abandoned that model 10 years ago because it is proven to discriminate.  _x000D__x000D_Walmart didn’t have HR until 2006 and it was only established because they were hit with multiple labor law suits.

Great for someone who is aiming to gain work experience in customer service.,"The daily tasks that are assigned to you while working with Walmart is very easy. The issues with this company comes from within with management and company policies.

About why im leaving walmart,"I show up every night at Wal-Mart to give it my 100%, I currently  stock frozen foods.. the reason I'm leaving is when every night I wrk, there's times frozen gets large amounts of freight, and when I'm talking about large amounts, it's average hours of freight is 10 hours or more per night... Basically I wrk 10 plus hours of freight by myself every night, when you get large amount of freight especially 10 plus hours, that requires two people in a 8 hour shift that I attend to wrk every night... But that's half the reason I'm leaving, the other reason is management.. When I do a two person job by myself every night in 8 hours I don't get no respect or compliments from them.. so to me that tells me they are just using my skill for there benefits and not me...",2,Current Employee,Frozen Food Stocker ,"Jackson, OH",5/25/18,2018,5,25

Overall work review,"Walmart isn't a horrible place to work when you're a teenager, it's a great starter job. The typical work day, for a cashier, consists of scanning, bagging, and zoning items on shelving. But also dealing with annoyed customers that didn't have the experience they wanted. The management, at this specific store, wasn't all that horrible but I feel as if they were too relaxed on some of the employees. The hardest part of being a cashier is finding ways to deal with upset customers, because believe me it wasn't easy. The most enjoyable part about being a cashier is often times you get to see the same customers quite a few times a week, it makes for great conversation while scanning their items. Lastly, there are some things that this walmart does absolutely poorly. When it comes to holiday shopping/sales it is not well managed, and it is just a mess. Nothing is planned it feels as if it is all thrown in your face, it is a very overwhelming time of year. Hence why I quit in November.",2,Former Employee,CASHIER ,"Forest Lake, MN",5/25/18,2018,5,25

Managment is very kind and will work with you in most situations that life brings up. They're strict about attendance just like any other job and give you 9 call ins in a 6 month period.

For the most part the work environment was nice and family-like, but with so many switches in management at one time, the closeness of the store and it's people skills has diminished. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of higher management maintaining accurate and consistent work among their associates and picking up that slack. The most enjoyable part of the job is being left alone to get the job done as accurately as possible.

Fun place to work but has its stresses,"I really enjoyed being a cashier at Wal-Mart cause interacting with the public is fun. _x000D_I will say though, one thing I didn't like was the fact they would mostly deny cashiers restroom breaks.

We had times where it was busy but also slow depending on the time of day. I learned money handling, customer service, and learning how to handle situations with customers. The management was very helpful and understanding. The workplace culture was different because I never worked in retail before, but it was one of the best decisions i made. The hardest part of the job was if it got busy we had to quickly check people out and deal with angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job consisted of my coworkers and relaxing breaks.

"Solid place, if you can work at a good pace","Solid compensation for being entry-level. From what I saw it seems reasonable to think you can move up in the company. Since it is such a large company management has a focus on numbers which was troublesome, because there are unforeseen circumstances. However, if you learn the job well and get on a good quick pace things should be fine, assuming you get along with management and coworkers._x000D__x000D_Over an 8 hour shift there are 2 fifteen minute breaks which are paid at your hourly rate, and an hour break which isn't._x000D__x000D_The more years you put in at Walmart the more vacation you get.

CSM's ruined the job,"As a cashier we had to rely on the CSM's for everything, but most would never actually get on register to ring if we were packed and needed the help.

Ultimately Depends on What You Make It,"Working at Walmart is different from a person to person basis. Management some stores can competent and helpful, while in others can be difficult to deal with. Likewise with coworkers, some are really nice people who are either there for a temporary position or even as a career, while others can be outright lousy. In my experience, it's ultimately how you handled yourself and your attitude towards to job. I've gone through different management teams over the years, helped various stores, and learned different positions. From the Department Manager role, I had days that I was incredibly stressed out and wanted to quit. Then there are other days that I was truly happy with the amount of work I have accomplished and was happy with my decisions. In my current role as a Department Manager, I've learned so much about business that it can be applied from classrooms such as accounting, public speaking, critical thinking, marketing, human resources, and various other subjects. Overall, Walmart is a great company to work at. I will admit Walmart does have some room to grow in various areas such as being more associate friendly, having better processes, and having more consistency within the stores. They do offer great benefits such as health and dental insurance, 401k, stock options, and PTO.",5,Current Employee,DEPARTMENT MANAGER ,"Chandler, AZ",5/23/18,2018,5,23

Fun work place and great opportunities,A typical day at walmart would be showing up early and on time to your shift and getting straight to work. Getting the job done fast but effectively. The hardest part of the job I would say was zoning and fixing things and then when costumers are buying you'd have to fix it.

great place,"a typical day at Walmart is pretty great its a good environment and the associates there are so friendly.

"Fun workplace, meet new people good pay",I did have a few issues with Management that was not in my department but they were always easily resolved. Almost always received the same days off the were requested. The hardest part of the job was when I would be at the customer service desk with no help and long lines and frustrated customers but I usually was always able to handle it on my own and if not then I was always able to page to have someone sent up who was trained for customer service desk to help if need be.

Get What You Put Into It,"There is a large number of people that I respect and love working for at Wal-Mart, just as there are some that do make the job more difficult. While some aspects of the different stores vary, the standards the company sets are high, as they should be. They workday can vary, but overall, it is becoming more focused on the customer perspective, and everything done is to improve the customer's shopping experience. _x000D_The training programs are continuing to improve, especially toward better preparing external hires for the company and creating more empathetic managers. I feel that for the most part, I have been given opportunities toward promotion, as well as support if that's what I wanted to do. There are many associates that only wish to put in a 24-hr work week answering the phones, and if that is a the case, there is a position for that as well. If the store does well, the bonuses can be quite good, and each store is encouraged to celebrate holidays with hot meals for the associates. _x000D_For the most part, each store I've worked at, the associates were accepting and helpful. Everyone has pretty much the same goal, if not the same methods to achieve it. _x000D_I would say that I am not unhappy working at Wal-Mart, and for someone who truly enjoys customer service and retail, it is the ideal place.",4,Current Employee,ASSISTANT MANAGER ,"Troy, MI",5/23/18,2018,5,23

Very productive and a fun place to work overall,I stocked the shelves and helped customers when needed. I learned where a lot of items were in the store and how to do several different jobs. The management was friendly and knew how to do their job well. The hardest part of the job was when you were asked by several customers for help.

Unpleasant,"The rules always seem to change at this company. As a stocker they push you and push to put out more and more stock, faster and faster. It can be very stressful sometimes. Management frequently changes personnel and policies frequently change. They have a strict attendance policy and once you receive certain number of points you are fired. However, at the particular store I worked at, certain employees seem to abuse this policy and never get fired while others are held to the  attendance rules. It was very frustrating.

WalMart Work,"A typical day at WalMart  would be arriving to work, having the shift meeting and getting to your duties until your first 15 minute break.

The last hour of work, I would zone the areas to make sure they were nice and tidy._x000D_The hardest part of the job is zoning, customers will mess a display and not bother to put things where they belong, so that can be frustrating. _x000D_The best part is the coworkers.

Working at Walmart is great! They have a great selection for all ages.,"Co- workers are friendly and very hardworking. Greeting and waiting on customers at the cash register and helping them out is awesome. It is great to get customers through the line in a timely manner.  I love working as a cashier and serving others. Especially, when you can move about periodically to help out in other department, and you don't get problems with repetitive motion when you work at different areas. The turn tables should really be replaced with something else that is lightweight, when the bags get full the table is heavier to push. Or they should be automatic. See through bags would be better, so there are not so many left behinds. This would make for greater customer appreciation and satisfaction. The customers should be told they are welcome to help bag their groceries, because it makes them feel more comfortable because they have something to do. and they can get out in a more timely manner. This is a great help to the cashier as well. However, I feel it should be the cashier that offers for them to help bag because some do not want the help. The cashier must oversee that the bagging is done correctly for safety reasons. The CSM's are all really nice and hardworking. They take their jobs seriously. They manage many problem solving situations for customers and for cashiers, managers, and other co-workers.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Representative ,"Presque Isle, ME",5/23/18,2018,5,23

Stressful and too much like high school,Mainly for where I worked (the bakery) it was nothing but putting people down (minus a few workers who were awesome) and being frustrated with everything.

"Be quiet and just say yes to everything, right or wrong","If you believe in high work place morals and the integrity of the work place no matter the persons job-title, then you may want to rethink emploment. I can honestly say that if corporate would do random pop-ins not letting anyone including the market managers know they are coming, true knowledge of what really goes on with daily operations would be a real eye opener. Thing is when made aware of the pop-in the market managers contact the store managers and the store managers meet with the operation managers to correct any issues before visit so ultimately the visit is a facade. I will admit that the benefits are mostly what keeps the employees besides needing a job. This is one of the easiest places to get a job, any and everyone just about is hired.

In my department (fabrics, crafts, party, and office supplies) my entire job was cutting fabric for customers, assisting customers by answering questions and the like, and keeping the shelves organized and stocked. I wasn't given any daily tasks most days, so a lot of the time I had to make up jobs for myself (I worked evenings and was the only one there at that time) when there was no organizing to do or fabric to cut.

"Stressful employment, long hours, lower than average salary.","The most frustrating thing about working at Walmart is that a typical day feels like taking one step forward, followed by two steps backward.  The inherent culture forces management styles to be reactive, and to consistently shift priorities.  Often this means that plans are changed midway through and since success is constantly redefined.  Employees quickly learn that it is impossible to complete all tasks expected of them within a given shift.  Customer service takes a back seat to internal company metrics and deadlines.",1,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,North Carolina,5/21/18,2018,5,21
Great for Advancement but Beware!,"While I truly enjoyed my time here, I couldn't shake my own frustrations. Walmart has a plethora of opportunities and resources to help make better associates, but the day today operations won't allow time to take advantage of said resources. Too many opinions and egos on display that directly contradict company standards and too many company directives that directly contradict the company's own belief concerning their employees.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager/E-Commerce ,Texas,5/21/18,2018,5,21

This was many years ago so I can o ly assume the company is better now,5,Former Employee,Automotive support manager ,"Amsterdam, NY",5/21/18,2018,5,21
"Productive, quick working place",Working at Walmart as a Stock Clerk required time management. I learned to complete tasks quickly. The hardest part was maintaining a steady speed to complete multiple tasks before the shift was over. Management was reliable when needed in many different situations and always helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was frequent breaks through the night. Frequent breaks were very necessary for the time spent working and standing on our feet. After a long period of standing it began to become overwhelming.,4,Former Employee,Environmental Services Technician ,"Grovetown, GA",5/21/18,2018,5,21

"Friend;y, Enjoyale and busy","Walmart has friendly employees and management is easy to communicate with being problems or solutions. Any department was easy to learn from, the other employees and bosses were eager to teach and make sure you knew what you were doing. It wasn't just do this and they left, they would stick around and help or guide you to the proper way of the task. With all companies there can be a bit or conflict, usually it can be deescalated through conversation or a third party deterrent. The hardest part of said conflict was when there is actually a problem with upper management. I personally would say this is the biggest problem with Walmart. When a boss trots around and just puts down other employees because they can!",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Norwich, NY",5/21/18,2018,5,21

"Productive, Fun workplace","A Typical day at work for me isn't the same everyday, you never know what you are going to walk into. You never know how busy or slow it will be. I learned a lot working at Walmart. My role was Customer Service so i handled returns, receiving/sending money, paying bills and money orders so I was a lot to learn but very easy going job. The management there are okay there are moments when they have their days and don't know how to treat their employees and other days they are amazing. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the rude customers or when your co-workers don't out in as much work as you are, but for me its easy just to not pay it any attention or get frustrate  and just complete my job. What i enjoy the most is that we get along like a family, helping the customers.",5,Current Employee,Associate ,"Frederick, MD",5/21/18,2018,5,21
Problems with scheduling,"Alternate management, and issues with scheduling by computer, with many changes.

Easy but managers made it hard,"Walmart could be a great and fun loving job. but poor management makes it hard on everyone. Expect you to stay longer then your shift if someones doesn't show up or calls out like its your responsibility. Gives out to many task to one person and expects them to jump around different departments to help everyone else when your own area is struggling. Not enough people to help, if you ask anyone most people end up quitting because of poor management .",3,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Columbia, SC",5/21/18,2018,5,21
horrible,"working at Walmart was horrible, they only gave me one day a week and worked so hard, they treat employees like garbage and give you nothing in return.",3,Former Employee,Associate ,"San Bernardino, CA",5/21/18,2018,5,21
"fulll or potential, bad mangement","Honestly, Working at Walmart can be very stressful! If you have a good, mature, responsible manager you will do well. Some managers are clicky and immature. I didn't like that some managers I worked with made work about products instead of people, encouraging team mates to ignore customers and just make sure the product is out. One manager was extremely rude to employees and customers and all they did was transfer her to anew store. I was put into dangerous situations being the first face my store saw, anger, belligerent customers would come in making threats, yelling and cursing at me. sometimes I would have to call 911 on my personal phone because a store manager would not come to assist and they moved the undercover employees to public places such as registers or the doors.",4,Former Employee,Front End supervisor ,"Lauderdale Lakes, FL",5/21/18,2018,5,21

Good place to work.,Thank you. I learned a lot about plants and their care. I also learned the cashier work as i feel to be a people person.

demanding work place,There is always something to do which is great.  No two days are ever the same.  There is a lot required of an associate which requires a lot of training.  Moving up is usually pretty easy of you try and work hard.,4,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Clayton, NC",5/21/18,2018,5,21
Every day is work and work and work,"I am specific about workplace at Walmart in Forest Lake, Minnesota. I worked briefly with them and I can say in CAP II the management style was intimidation from the supervisors on performance. They set targets that are unrealistic. For example, you are told to stock shelves with 4 pallets of cereals in 3 and half hours. Their timing is one minute fifteen seconds per carton. This time takes into consideration walking to pick the carton from the cart, scanning the carton to find the quantity on shelf and location, and then stocking the goods onto the shelf.Most time the scanner will tell you that you have more quantity on the floor but when you do a physical check there is nothing on the floor, The inventory record is just not accurate,_x000D__x000D_When the pallets are not completed in the time specified, the managers are not interested in the workload. Once customers are asking you for help on the floor, you have to leave to go and assist customers.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Forest Lake, MN",5/21/18,2018,5,21
"Job is alright, Management is terrible","Job it's self is alright, management and culture are the problems here. Management pushes people until they quit and do not care about their employees.",4,Former Employee,Instock Supervisor ,"Chattanooga, TN",5/21/18,2018,5,21

"I enjoyed my experience as a manager opening a new pharmacy, and meeting new people.","I was the pharmacist that opened a new wal-mart neighborhood market. I was also expected to put on a hard hat and assemble shelves. Organization was an issue. I was supposed to be allowed to make some comments at the grand opening of the store but that did not happen. New policies and procedures were introduced without adequate training, and everyone was expected to know them. The business was very profit focused, which I understand. The pharmacy in wal-mart exists so people will come and shop while they wait for their prescriptions. That being said, compensation was adequate, but it proved not to be worth the negative aspects of the job for me. I focus on improving people's health and quality of life, not removing money from their pockets.",2,Former Employee,PHARMACIST ,Various,5/21/18,2018,5,21

Not a bad company to work for.,"When I first was employed at Walmart back in 2003, it was a fun place to work. There were enough associates for each department to service the customers. As with every company cuts were made to staffing to increase profits for the company, so by the time I left the company in 2017, most sales floor associates were stretched to multiple departments and were not able to assist customers like they deserved to be.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Knightdale, NC",5/21/18,2018,5,21

"productive, good enviroment","well you clock in and go to a meeting, then you find out what your tasks are and you go start on your task. I have learned that when you need help there are lots of people to help, most of the time you keep busy with the tasks that are given to you. management on nightshift is great the work super hard to make sure they not only get there tasks done but help others if needed, one manager I had when I worked overnight was fair but firm she was willing to help you out if you needed it or she would provide you with help. I think the hardest part of the job was when I first started working there and customer's would ask me where things where and I wasn't sure but being there for a while you catch on pretty quick and are better able to help them. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team at times there would be an off night or two or there would be times where work load was over barring but with the help of my team it was great.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance Associate ,"Gaylord, MI",5/21/18,2018,5,21

Being a D.M. is like one day you will be the best in the store ready for promotion theyre setting you as an example and then the next day your no good getting a coaching bout to be fired all because their expectations of you are so high.

My only option to stay with the company was to start at the bottom where I had started 19 years ago. My knowledge, skills, and dedication was never taken into consideration when keeping a position in the office where I had worked for over 5 years.

Good entry level job,"Most of my coworkers were great people, as well as the managers, however, sometimes the managers were a bit blunt with us. I had issues with two of my 6-7 managers, but I was fortunate to not have to interact with them much. One of my managers would consistently stick me with jobs that required 3 people at least, and the other one was just incredibly rude and not a people person shall we say. Otherwise, it was a great job. We were stuck on a tight schedule and my feet were almost constantly hurting, but it was an enjoyable experience. Every Thursday (Working nights, so it would really be our Friday), the managers would expect a visit from corporate, and would have us do incredibly menial tasks those days, but those were the most relaxing days we had there because they didn't really care what we were doing as long as we did our jobs.",5,Former Employee,Remodel Temp ,"Arnold, MO",5/19/18,2018,5,19

not the same company,"It's not the same it's changed over the  years and not for the better. The pay isn't very good, I feel like they don't value good employees. And the day that I quit I was never thanked for my Long-term years of service there. I did do things properly and put my two weeks notice and work the last day I said I was going to work instead of calling off. When asked to do something I would generally do with without any complaining or any resistance. The one time they asked me to go out and help gather cards out in the rain. I was not dressed for the occasion and I tried to get out of doing it but because of my kind heart I ended up going out there for half an hour. It was cold wet and rainy in my shoes got soaked. I ended up getting sick and called off the next day because I was unable to work. I got penalized for calling off. They have removed so many benefits from their employees that they used to get in order to save them money. When I quit I was barely making $12 an hour after being there for Over 10 years. Their pay raises aren't very good and like I said above they do not value good employees. It seems like all they care about is making money. In fact the day that I got fired they asked for the box cutters that they had given me During my employment. My last job there was a cashier which did not require me to have any of those box cutters on my person. So in essence they did not get them back. The whole exit interview I thought was one big slap to the face and I am not impressed with the company at all.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Ashland, OH",5/18/18,2018,5,18

No current feedback,"fWalmart likes to say it is a good place to work.  If you have a good manager, who doesn't have frequent migraines, it may be a good place to work.

He was either in a management meeting or running one of two other stores.  I think he was trying to be an Area Supervisor. While I knew my job and was friendly with the customers, my co-workers, were slower than I am, were often rude to customers, and in general, didn't care about good customer service.",1,Former Employee,"Sales Associate, Meat Department ","Athens, TX 75751",5/18/18,2018,5,18

"Always Low Prices, Always deplorable managers.","Ain't much to say about Walmart, a few of the managers didn't care much about others or myself, they didn't really notice you until you made a mistake or were 3 minutes late to work *which if you were so much as 1 minute late to clock in you were immediately asked to turn everything in and were fired on the spot gleefully by the on site manager* _x000D_ _x000D_A few employees were pleasant but seemed rather shut in so to speak.

Management is never satisfied with our work and will constantly berate us for issues outside of our control. They often encourage you to get things done as fast as possible, then complain about strategies that are taken to accomplish these goals. Also, team scheduling is an annoyance.

Associate review,"As with any larger type retail store, there is a higher turnover rate. In retail you will work nights and weekends, no exceptions. If you like working as a team and working in customer service field this is a good fit for you. A benefit of the job is that you can in most cases cross train in almost every department.

Decent,Well I worked for walmart in 2016 and started out as a temp and ended a part time associate. For the most part if youre getting good hours you will work a 9 hour shift with two 15 minute breaks on clock and 1 hour lunch off clock. I started at 9.00 then went to 9.17 after like two or three months and then started working overnight so i ended with 10.50. If anything theres more drama between customers than co-workers if anyone is worried. I tend to keep to myself but if youre a cashier you will form some sort of work bond with other cashiers because you switch on and off to relieve eachother for breaks etc. Management will vary therefore proper training will vary but for the most part youll be prepared. Theres A LOT of computer training in the personnel room.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Spring Hill, FL",5/16/18,2018,5,16

deteriorating culture,"I have worked for Wal-Mart for over a decade. Values are steadily going down the drain. Management is partial, unreasonable and subjective. Instead of encouraging a positive work environment, cut throat tactics is the culture now. Employees are treated as mere metrics producers, not humans. Every quarter, more help hours are reduced, expectations are increased followed by threatening emails about being fired if the metrics are not met. We're now being told that not being available to work overtime negatively affects your evaluation. Where is the work-life balance? I work full-time and am expected to neglect my children on my days off as well if I desire a fair evaluation! This is how pay inequality is propagated in 2018.

Experience was a mess,"Things I experienced when I worked at Wal-Mart may not reflect on how they are today. While the pay was may have been okay at the time for an entry position at part-time, opportunities for a full time position were scarce and working in a lower position meant handling 3 other employees jobs as well as your own at once quite often. There were hardly enough employees there, as well as a severe lack of communication between the multiple tiers of management, which often led to one manager being dissatisfied over certain tasks not being finished at the request of another manager to prioritize a different task. There were also many situations in which employees were pulled into departments they had never worked in before, and actual training to do the job was virtually non-existent aside from what was mandatory workplace behavior training. Benefits were decent there, but there were many things wrong with a lot of other things and workers were often not treated with respect they deserved. That said, in recent conversation with others who are still with the company, I have discovered that many policies have been drastically reworked for the better there, and I feel with the new starting pay, benefits, and restructure of how things are managed the company is a very different place than what it was when I was there before.",3,Former Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Morrilton, AR",5/16/18,2018,5,16
"Good pay, but not enough to live well","Good pay, bad management, stressful, small discount, and nobody really works efficiently. I learned not to get hurt.

We had to constantly keep moving, it required a lot of energy to lift heavy objects.",3,Former Employee,Stockroom Associate ,"Henrico, VA",5/16/18,2018,5,16
"Great pay, if you can make it","Walmart management is a high intensity job that requires a lot of your time, and a lot of your energy. You are put into a store that has already been set up with a company that coddles it's associates into making your job impossible to do if they don't like you. They have eliminated advancement potential unless you are already in the position to be a store manager so you are stuck where you are at unless your market manager loves you out the hundreds of other managers at their disposal.",4,Current Employee,ASSISTANT STORE MANAGER ,North Carolina,5/16/18,2018,5,16

Do not work here. Period,"I've worked for Walmart twice now. Once as a stocker, and the second time as a pharmacy tech. I honestly might be a bit biased considering that I have had major problems with management at both of the locations I worked at. The first time a family member died and they wouldn't give me the time off to attend the funeral, even though I followed proper Walmart procedure. The second time I had a manager that had unrealistic expectations, he wouldn't work with me on my schedule (I was and still am attending college as a full time student), and he actively singled me out from other people he had hired at the time. I actually rose to meet those expectations by completing the tasks he gave me quickly, and because of this he actively blocked me from advancing in the job, and receiving my certification as a Pharmacy Tech. The only reason I stayed for a long as I did was because I wanted to prove him wrong, but also because of the people. Most of everyone I worked with were good people. So if I have one positive about working there it would be that the people I worked with there made the time I spent working much more tolerable.",1,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Oklahoma City, OK",5/16/18,2018,5,16

Worst place,I started Walmart almost 3 years ago. I have to say it has been an awful experience. There has been only 3 mangers that actually know what they are doing. This company is so disorganized and the lack of care is ridiculous. There is no policy to enforce but if you enforce it you get in trouble. If you don't you get in trouble. This place sets you up for failure. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I advice to anyone is to not work here or get out as soon as possible.,1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cortland, OH",5/15/18,2018,5,15

When it came down to the working environment it would be freezing in the winter and burning hot in the summer, customers would even complain. Walmart didn't really teach me anything special it just gave me something extra to put on my resume more customer service skills because I found myself working in warehousing a lot.  the hardest part about the job.. was keeping your composer especially when your getting treated wrong other than that I did my job professionally never had a problem out of any of my customers. the best part of the job was helping people from different races, I enjoyed being helpful.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Orland Hills, IL",5/15/18,2018,5,15

At the store I transferred to, management leaves you do your job and doesn't mind if you chat with your co workers for a few moments. We do keep these conversations brief so we don't lose that trust. But the difference is like night and day. Customers can either make your whole day or make you want to pull your hair out. You really have to be able to take the good and let the bad roll off your back. I like being cross trained to be able to mix paint, cover several departments, and help as a cashier as well as unload the trucks. Not everyone gets that much training, but I was either ""volunteered"" for it or picked it up as I went along.",4,Current Employee,Floor Associate/Cashier ,"Belle Vernon, PA",5/14/18,2018,5,14
Productive and engaging,"Great place to work, and workers work as a team and the managers have concern for the employees.   I like the way Walmart is ran.

A company that gets a bad rep.,"Wal-mart is an excellent company to work for- they promote mostly from within.

Stressful workplace,"As a cashier, you deal with a lot of people. Some not as good as others. But those who aren't mean to you, makes the job worth it. They offer a decent pay for your work as well. For the most part the hours weren't too horrible. The worst part of the job was the management/ supervisors. They play favoritism among the cashiers. If you were one of the ""favorites"" the CSM/CSS would allow you to do almost anything you wanted to. Sometimes going to management about it was pointless because they didn't really care. I know a lot has changed since I have worked there, so it could be different now.

Great company to start off with,"Walmart is a overall great company to start out your career. If you work hard and is amphibious, you can easily move up in the Walmart chain. I have met Co-Managers, Store Managers, and even District Managers who started at the bottom and worked their way up the Walmart chain. The hardest part about working in the company is the constant change in policies. Some things that can be tough would be communicating with your direct manager, because they aren't always there. Another thing about the company is that sometimes the policies may be hard to follow, but luckily the management team and human resource does a great job at answering questions.",4,Current Employee,PRODUCE DEPARTMENT MANAGER ,"Woodbury, MN",5/14/18,2018,5,14
"Stressful environment, yet still amazing to gain customer service experience","There is always plenty of things to do while working for Wal-Mart. The list is never ending.

They are never there to assist you with any questions and when you do have the chance to ask they are brute and rude. They do not help you for anything, even for assault and threats by other employees like bringing in a gun to work, fighting, threats of assault, etc. HR is also horrible at handing situations like these.

My pay got cut by 70 Cents and they could not/would not tell me why. Manager doesnt follow standard operation procedures, and for whatever reason wont give me a consistent schedule.

It was Okay,"Get your work done in a reasonable time and you will have no problems. Find areas where you can relax a little more while still getting your work done and helping customers and management will not complain. As a Cap team 2 employee you are the backbone of Walmart you are also the dog of Walmart and they will pay you just as much as they pay people who do far less then you. If you show up do not cause problems and get your assigned work done you will never get fired from cap 2 they are always short on cap 2. They will never pay you overtime and you have no obligation to stay passed your time if they assigned you clearly too much work and never sent any help. Leave at your clock out time every day as long as you pick up your trash they will not be able to say anything as you are doing nothing wrong. If you do anything against any of this tho they will fire you before your 6 months are up for any little thing that goes against the rules. They wont fire you instantly but instead opt to wait till the day before your 6 months is over and fire you right before any benefits would have saved you. Work at Walmart sure, have a plan B tho as it is worth it to work there and can be a great learning experience, but Walmart is a business not a family no matter how much they try and drill that into your head.",3,Former Employee,Cap team 2 ,"Boutte, LA",5/13/18,2018,5,13

Also there is extremely high turnover rate._x000D__x000D_The work is fairly easy but management is typically incompetent. Rather then put employees where their needed, management would allow multiple employees to complain about their job and move them.

My position I love to do but there are some trashy assistant managers and childish high school gossip. Other department managers act worse than kids, but the pros to it is that some that also got insulted cause other positions look down on them told me I don't have to respect someone who didn't earn it and that I should push through it, unlike my own boss who just was all ""either listen or you know clock out and go home for the day"" So instead of standing up for his entire crew we just have to take the fact that our hard work is considered ""laziness"" but thanks to the other managers I was annoyed the entire day but they eased it for me, I was tempted to change positions to cart pushing or something to keep me away from that negative nonsense or quit altogether. It might seem small to them but respect is a big thing and the fact the guy literally aimed at us with his statement of ""no laziness on around me"" when we just finished doing a job and he claimed he saw me doing nothing all day when I just clocked into said job an hour before he set eyes on me after coming back from a staging.

"I was paid generously, but the job sucked","At the evergreen wamart, they paid me 11.50 an hour, which was great, although the work was tedious and unrewarding.

established company with good advancement opportunity,my experience with Walmart was at times great but at other times not so much. It is a worthy company with good people but some of the management were hard to deal with as well as some of the coworkers in the same field. Most of this was only because people wanted to move up in the company to make more money and that is understandable.,4,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Virginia Beach, VA",5/11/18,2018,5,11

The work load was overwhelming, not enough staff to get the jobs done.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Ozark, AL",5/11/18,2018,5,11
Poor management and no team work,Walmart is a good company but only in certain locations. Management always micro manages and gets mad at an employee because of not getting work done even though they were the ones who told them to do something else. Most locations have managers who do not know how to talk to people in a professional setting.,4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"San Antonio, TX",5/11/18,2018,5,11
Not fun at all except coworkers are fun to be around with,I don't plan on ever working for walmart again or at least for a very long time. I've been mistreated and lied to plenty of times.

Greatly appreciated the patience of most of the people I worked along side.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Klamath Falls, OR",5/11/18,2018,5,11
Productive workplace with great management,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking and zoning product. I often made trips to the warehouse to aid the receiving crew with unloading trucks.

It wasn't a good experience,"Walmarts in the area where I'm from are known for extremely bad customer service because they hire rude employees who think they should be paid for doing absolutely nothing (but in our area that's basically all there is). Therefore, the customers come in with the attitude that they are going to get bad customer service so they automatically have hateful attitudes. No matter how hard I tried to give good customer service it was never enough.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Associate ,"Pearl, MS",5/11/18,2018,5,11

"Overworked, low pay, terrible management","As a front end supervisor, I had 7 other people on my same level but our manger quit around Christmas and as of April that position was never filled making my job rely on other managers who would argue on wether they would help up front. Management would get angry at my position for not being able to do role that only the salary management could do. It was common to have no help when it was required. There was even a moment when I asked a store manager who was the acting manager on the front end and she laughed in my face like I was joking.",1,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Fredericksburg, VA",5/11/18,2018,5,11
Fun workplace,Fun eager to work employees who are more than willing to help you at anytime. The managers are very consistent with you schedule and work hours. This is a joyful environment.,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Oakdale, LA",5/11/18,2018,5,11
Great company to work for.,Advancement very easy to obtain for goal driven associates.  Profit sharing was a plus.  Matching % to stock purchase was good incentives to buy stock.  Enjoyed teaching new associates how to accomplish assigned tasks.,5,Former Employee,Management ,Several cities new stores were opening.,5/11/18,2018,5,11
Stressful corporate environment with little to no room for advancement.,I'm sure there was a time Wal-Mart wasn't a hollow work environment but it isn't anymore. Employees are expected to jam 12+ hours of work into half that time with very scarce allowance for overtime. Management can't seem to follow standard procedure on a regular basis and only seems to care when corporate is breathing down their throats. Often times they also cannot perform some of the basic tasks of your job or answer questions you or customers have and can be found usually walking the floor with their face planted firmly in their phone screens.,1,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Broken Arrow, OK",5/11/18,2018,5,11
Wouldn't recommend,Unless you're in with the management you don't have a prayer of advancing or  keeping your job. You get put down on a daily basis and yelled at by your manager especially in the bakery at 2318. You can't talk to upper management about any manager cause they don't fix the problem they go to the person and tell them what was said. That's their method of fixing a problem. Its sad when you have to talk yourself into going to work because of the stress your manager puts you thru. If your in the manager click you get all the early shifts and never have to close. You can plan evenings with family and friends cause you know that you never have to work past 4. That's called fair to the managers at this store. While the rest of the employees have to plan around their work schedule. The manager picks even get their vacations they want and don't need to worry about being turned down for the days they want.,1,Former Employee,Baker/Donuts ,"Indiana, PA",5/11/18,2018,5,11

Challenging and fast paced,"Walmart is a challenging and fast paced workplace that is in a mode of reinvention.  The shift from a traditional brick and mortar model to one that encompasses a strong focus on E-commerce has led to many changes in job responsibilities, process and routines.  These changes have created a uncertainty for a lot of associates, but have also provided new opportunities for growth.",4,Current Employee,Training Facilitator ,"Boise, ID",5/11/18,2018,5,11

culture,"Years ago WalMart had a culture of 3 basic beliefs- Respect for the Individual, Customer Service and Strive for Excellence. Having spent over 20 years with this company they have gone farther and farther away from these beliefs. Customer service has lacked since the amount of associates available keeps dwindling from year to year. Respect for the individual by some Managers has disappeared and the only belief that has stayed strong is striving for excellence, which excellence is MONEY!",3,Former Employee,Co-Manager/Store Manager ,Pennsylvania,5/11/18,2018,5,11

Able to Advance Quickly,"At Walmart, there are opportunities to advance in pay grades in a quick amount of time. Hard work and dedication are key. However, during certain times of the year, there are cuts in hours that take place. There are also times when it feels like some people are favored over others, unfortunately.

The workplace culture considered customers first and right all the time. We had to keep an eye out for customers which needed help and the managers expected us to leave our stocking duties to assist them but also complete our stocking tasks completely.

Mixed.,"The job itself is alright. No real downside, but no real upside either. Hard labor, but I don't mind that. The problem is management. They are the worst bunch of slackers you ever met. They don't care about their workers and treat them like a disposable commodity. When something goes right, they take the credit with the higher-ups, and when something goes wrong, they blame the workers, whether the workers are responsible for the problem or not.

Horrible Management and Misleading Role,"I recently left my job at Walmart as a Category Specialist for numerous reasons and would strongly suggest steering clear. I am specifically calling it Walmart vs Jet because while they market the role as working for Jet, you spend your entire time as a Walmart employee. The role is also marketed as leading your own business when in reality you are simply executing mundane tasks that haven't been automated yet. Management is unfortunately all over the place and really dependent on which team you are placed on. Because the company is expanding so much, the managers are very new to a managerial role and oftentimes lack the experience necessary to drive their employees to success. I noticed that there were certain managers who micromanaged their employees constantly throughout the day without allowing them the ability to accomplish tasks in their own way. If you are looking to be micromanaged without much room for advancement, then apply for this role.",2,Current Employee,Category Specialist ,"New York, NY",5/9/18,2018,5,9

The hardest part of the job.,I believe the hardest part about working here is having to deal with customers who are uncooperative. You just have to remember to keep a level head and keep a happy attitude and tone of voice.,4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Springdale, AR",5/9/18,2018,5,9
No Title,Arriving to work on time is the best thing to do since some employees may call off which will leave you more work to complete before your shift is over.,3,Former Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE REP ,"Atlanta, GA",5/9/18,2018,5,9
Poor management,Some mangers are poorly unorganized. They don't want to hire any people for certain shift therefor requiring them to do twice the work. Its a very stable job though and don't have to worry about getting laid off. You gain PTO by the amount of hours you work instead of a fix amount per year. Its a good place to work if you need a job and all the people that works there are friendly.,3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Derby, KS",5/9/18,2018,5,9

great,Working for Wal-Mart was great the team was great. Coming in they treat you like family.

"The cooperate does the scheduling, so we get a lot of split days off","When I first started the scheduling was great, I used to have the same days off for weeks straight then out of no where they switched my set schedule and now I have no set schedule what so ever. It’s even more annoying because we cannot have unpaid time off so if we cannot work for whatever reason we have to use our paid time off and you only get so much time. Managers do try their hardest to satisfy their associates (at least the ones I’ve had) but they can only do so much. And the staffing is way too low.",3,Current Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Lodi, CA",5/9/18,2018,5,9

Walmart provides enough salary for my areas living costs as well as excellent benefits.,Once trained you always feel comfortable working in the conditions they provide in exchange for an excellent pay rate. The hardest part of the job is becoming accustomed to the labor but once train as I stated earlier the job becomes very simplistic.,5,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Woodland, PA",5/8/18,2018,5,8
A productive and fun work place,"A typical day at walmart would include providing excellent customer service. On a daily basis, i changed the gun that controlled the prices. The hardest part of the job was that the store was so busy that i did not have any time to learn any new trades.",4,Former Employee,associate ,"Chicago, IL",5/8/18,2018,5,8

Productive place with opportunity to grow within the company,"A typical day at work is very calculated, everything that everyone in the store is required to do is listed out and maintained in a company planning guide. The job as a manager is to verify and follow up on store associates to ensure processes are being followed, while developing plans and strategies for future store level projects and events. The culture of the store changes from store to store, but the management tends to be relatively close, spending a lot of time together and encouraged to work with each other. In the company I have learned lots about people, money, and retail management, having to develop plans and put plans into action while juggling many other responsibilities. The hardest part of the job is the life balance, it can be very rewarding having a successful inventory or Christmas holiday, but especially during busy times, and being salaried, with only one day off at a time it becomes very difficult to separate career and home life. On the flip side, it is very rewarding to see your associates grow and develop as you work with them to improve skills and processes. There are lots of positives within the company, the ability to move up is outstanding, always being pushed to improve yourself and grow within the company without being forced to do so, everyone that works within the store gets along well, almost forming a family based environment.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Roxboro, NC",5/8/18,2018,5,8
Not as bad as it seems,"Working at Walmart was not as bad for me. yes, you did sometimes get the bad side of people but its best not to take them so seriously . They did work with my schedule after asking them a couple of times.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tucson, AZ",5/8/18,2018,5,8

Horrible place,Drama and nothing but management constantly on you draining your energy and piling up tasks. Negativity from almost everyone there. I would never want to work there EVER again.

Most Negative company I ever worked at,"Walmart is a company I would advise avoiding at all costs. The floor staff is treated as disposable and paid the least possible to retain them. Set schedules are unheard of. Management would cut hours for not having a completely open schedule, even if that would mean being present outside the hours your department was open. Priority was given to people who could reschedule on a whim or had no limits on when they could work, instead of using that flexibility to ""fill in the cracks"" of coverage._x000D__x000D_The manager of the particular store where I worked would assign random tasks to employees, then berate them on the sales floor for completing said tasks claiming that he did not want them done. I do not like to purchase from this company in cases where reasonable alternatives exist.",1,Former Employee,Sales Clerk ,"Salem, NH",5/8/18,2018,5,8

I was in Deli but was dragged out of my area multiple times to do jobs I was not trained or qualified for. Lots of Drama. The hardest part of the job is trying to do more than five things at once.

Need new management: From Store manager all the way down,"Just full of messy and petty people also non organization I am surprised that, that store has stayed open. Managers would make you do work for them even though a different manager told you to work on something else.

I got written up twice within the first two weeks of the month (they call it ""coachings"") you can Only get three.

Walmart Review,"I, as an employee, enjoyed my day at Walmart,  I loved my job as a Front End Cashier, Like working with the public and helping others.  The job has a lot to learn, however if you want to be excellent at customer service & ensure prompt and courteous service while checking out customers efficiently, with accuracy. You may have to make an over& above effect to learn all duties etc.  I had no problems with management as far as I know, never brought to my attention anyway. The workplace was pleasant to me. The hardest part of the job was probably to get use to standing for a long period of time, and the fast pace when it got busy. However, when you concentrate on your customers getting checked out as soon as possible & accurately. Leaving satisfied with a smile. You feel good about your work, And for me that was the most enjoyable part of the job.",4,Former Employee,Front End/Cashier ,"Dallas, TX",5/7/18,2018,5,7
I enjoy working with people,I enjoy meeting and talking to customers. that is the best part of my work. the worse part is the attitude that some customers have. some people are very negative.

I am learning Spanish so I can communicate with them.,3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Louisville, KY",5/7/18,2018,5,7

Anti-union for obvious reasons,You can only afford to live working at Walmart if it's subsidized with food stamps and other government programs. They have an open door policy in which you can speak to management. It is not properly practiced and is just a way to be recognized by management in a negative way. If you need to take LOA for medical reasons it is not an easy process it is not guaranteed and often ends in termination.,2,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Pauls Valley, OK",5/7/18,2018,5,7

Loved to work for walmart team players they are,"I worked for Walmart 2 times, the first time when they first built the building I helped set the whole store up. They then put all of us in a department and I was put on carts, I had to bring carts in. I was 19 at the time so I guess I couldn't complain to much. The second time I was put on 3rd shift stocking in the grocery department. I didn't like that to much because I was young at the time and hated staying in 1 spot. I was a person that liked to move around a lot so I think I liked the carts job better if you want my opinion.

Stressful but fast paced,A typical day at work was when I was given tasks by the managers I would promptly do them in a timely manor.

We were always understaffed so it was stressfull being a CSM,Management would not always come help you when needed. Some did most of the time.

"Great Place to work, but dead-end job.","Walamrt was a great place to work, and co-workers were very polite and nice. However, in order to advance in Walmart you must be the managers favorite. I went into the job with plans on advancing in the company. I learned you had to be there for six months in order to advance. So, I accepted that, tried to learn as much as I could and work hard every day. Once my six months were up and I had learned most jobs in the store I tried to advance, but others who had been there longer were advancing. I accepted that, kept learning and working hard. Eventually it got to the point after four years that I had more seniority than others advancing.I also knew how to do more jobs, people who were advancing over me would even ask me how to do certain jobs, and that was something I couldn't accept.

Cashier closing,"It was a nice place to work.  It was fast paced and multi task environment.  Breaks were never given at night to cashiers to close.  Lunches were given very late ,, ex. my shift was 3:00 p.m,. to 12:30 p.m. ....my lunch would be 10:30 or 11:00 at night.  In addition to that, there were only 4 closing cashiers.  It was overwhelmingly busy at a Supercenter Walmart with only 4 cashiers closing on a front end of 28 cash registers.  I was overworked without enough team manpower to help me close. Also the customers were still shopping after closing which was midnight. Management was quite unfair and had favoritism to associates that went out to smoke cigarettes with them.. The hardest part of the job was being left alone when other two cashiers went to lunch. This is a supercenter and there should at least be 8 cashiers available to close.  I enjoyed the customers at the job.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Philadelphia, PA",5/6/18,2018,5,6
Walmart ASM - Unreasonable expectations for a pitiful salary,"The life of an ASM is filled with non-stop problem-solving and unrealistic expectations. Regardless of what you are told, be prepared to work an average of 70-hours per week with very little time for yourself. The company has included ""integrity"" and ""respect for the individual"" in its core values, however, this philosophy really only extends to the hourly associates and upper management. _x000D__x000D_The ASMs live in the pit--constantly berated by upper management and belittled by Hourly Supervisors and Associates who are revered by Store Managers who value their loyalty as they follow them from store to store. These associates will constantly test your leadership because they have the ears and hearts of Store Management, because they have Walmart's ""Open Door"" policy in place to accommodate their ill-placed grievances and give them what they desire, and because they have seen many ASMs come and go over their careers so they know who has the real power in this relationship._x000D__x000D_New ASMs are subject to a 6-week Academy training which is nice in theory because you learn about Walmart culture and its company standards (One Best Way) which all sound fantastic and look great on paper but once you enter the reality of the store, it all flies out the window. Store Managers want what they want, period. _x000D__x000D_If you have a family, consider that you will spend little to no time with them. This will be especially difficult if you have children. The hours you work will not be conducive to sustaining meaningful relationships. Most weeks, you will get two days off but they will not be consecutive, therefore, - more...",1,Current Employee,ASSISTANT STORE MANAGER ,"Alpharetta, GA",5/6/18,2018,5,6

It is ok not what i expected at all in the 4 years i have been workung there,Walmart could care more about their employees well being since as schedule them the hours they required and not just what they want to give us.

Love my job and the company,I have worked here over 10 years and have promoted 2 times have a whole bunch of knowledge do not think I get paid for what I do or what I can bring to the table have been applying for other jobs.  Walmart’s downfall is placing the correct associate in the right placement. Just because they have gone to school does not mean they have the knowledge of the company systems or business that someone that has been there 10 years does. And then has to train the said new person who just moved from another team and has no knowledge or skills for the new position.,4,Current Employee,Supervisor GBS ,"Bentonville, AR",5/5/18,2018,5,5

"Very helpful, easy work, great pay.",A typical day at worked started by unloading a freight truck and then we moved on to stacking the merchandise in the backroom. Once the semi-trailer was emptied we were off to stock the shelves. i learned how to maneuver a palate jack and how to read freight tags. the management was always there to help and understand your feelings.

The customer is king. This is one thing i learnt-to aleways treat the customer with respect,"At Walmart, they give the impression that workers are not indispensable.

Working At Walmart,A typical day working at Walmart was standing behind a cash resigter and checking people out and helping bagging their iteams for them. As I was doing claims which i would put back bad items into a different room. And I use to do pick-ups which i would go shop for people who ordered online. The hardest part about working there was that they wouldnt work with me with my school schedule.

Walmart is a good place but recent changes are not,"Working at Walmart was always good. I have been there almost 15 years. just recently, they implemented a new scheduling system to ""better serve the customers and associates by placing the proper associates at the proper places to serve our customers at the proper times."" which translates to cutting hours and never having anyone where we need them and placing associates in departments they do not know so they can keep their 40 hours each week. On top of that, it goes based on how busy the store is which changes by the hour and is never consistent enough to gauge anything like schedules off of. _x000D__x000D_    The company claims it works fantastic at their Neighborhood markets and will implement it store-wide. The Problem there, The Neighborhood markets are basically like a smaller grocery store. not a super center or even a standard retail establishment. watching it in action, and even just reading how it is SUPPOSED to work, most of us long time associates knew it was doomed to fail. they keep pushing forward even though we have not enough cashiers... we have plenty, but absolutely none scheduled. departments are constantly empty due to having to use those associates to cashier leaving the departments empty and customers left to fend for themselves and thieves to have free reign. _x000D__x000D_   Walmart was a good place to work, but with this new scheduling debacle, it has quickly stopped being so. I would still recommend it if you want some work experience but do not want to do Fast Food. the pay and benefits are better.",3,Current Employee,Electronics and Wireless associate ,"Sonora, CA",5/5/18,2018,5,5
