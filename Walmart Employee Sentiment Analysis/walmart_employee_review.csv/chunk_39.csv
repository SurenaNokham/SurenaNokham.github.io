Fast paced work environment,"My day would start with unloading a 2,300 piece truck with my team of associates, palletizing merchandise as it is coming off of the truck, securing high shrink merchandise and comparing it against the receiving detail report. Then I would have my team pull the merchandise out to the floor stock it, bin the residue leftover and clean my receiving warehouse and file my invoices accordingly. The hardest part of my job would be when I have two or more unloaders calling in and there are two 2,000 piece trucks to unload. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing I got all my tasks completed on time if not earlier and that I always give 200% dedication.",3,Former Employee,2nd Shift ICS Supervisor ,"Houston, TX",4/8/14,2014,4,8

Going to lunch with the team while we talked about what we were going to do for the weekend if we got one. I learned how to distinguish what was going to be done on what night by the manager that was on duty.  I also learned that I am not as shy as I claimed to be for I was able to proficiently help a customer with no hesitation.  Management could have been a little better as I stated we were thrown in different directions according the manager that night.  As for my co-workers  I loved my team.  We were a family.

Decent place to work,Decent place to work considering pay and management. Management of Wal-Mart lets people who have been there for long periods of time pretty much do whatever they want/ get away with murder. Wal-Mart also doesn't hire enough people within the store in general this is mainly because everyone who isn't a cashier on the sales floor has to fill in when they need help and this causes no one to be on the sales floor. People wonder why they can never find employees in Wal-Mart this is the reason.,4,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Austin, TX",4/8/14,2014,4,8

What I've learned about working with Walmart is that everything seems better with a simple smile and that you should always look for an advance in the workplace. The management and co-works are a very diverse couple, although there was a little hint of corruption most of the management did very well taking care of it.

Not job security,"I work at walmart for 8 years just last month I was terminated because of (they say absentees), but for someone to have an intermittent on file to be let go. I only call out if its because of my son or weather related. I did my job that's all i wanted to was to to my job and go home. i feel as though management shows favoritism. I say that because I know some that calls out leave early come in late and all they get told and I quote: "" I told such and such to get their butt to work."" I feel that the store manager lacks, I feel at the store I worked at that there's no one and I mean no one you can go to. Why is it that when management love ones get sick its okay for them to just leave, but as a single parent when school call or my child wakes up sick or having a asthma attack and I call out letting them know that my child is sick that my job is threaten or even worst i lost my job regardless of the fact that I have a intermittent on file. Why is it so hard for single parents at walmart? I do feel like I was wrongfully terminated. I even called the store manager the next day and asked him to look into I have to have heard back from him. I didn't know as associate that i would have to managements job as will as mine to keep remaining of what and why I called out. I feel like this here will go by and no one will look into it.

Good job security but no worklife balance,I worked in store management and hated every second.  The manager job is very demanding on your time so you have no life. The only person in the store that makes good money is the manager. The assistant managers make poor money. They also work terrible hours.

They would always be gone walking around the store or outside with their friends, which caused issues with the cashiers, because when you need more cash or change you have to go to them and no matter how many times you would page them they would not come to you until the were done their ""social hour"". Costumers would get mad the cashiers that would not get the extra cash and change they needed would have to tell the costumers debt/ credit only because you could not make change. The CSMs would  get really grouchy and start treating you badly once you told them about the issue with them not doing with they were suppose to. (corruption) Then the CMSs not giving you lunch breaks or 15 min breaks because they would have had to cover someone. Thats the reason why now if it is time for your lunch break your register will lock you out. I do not know how many times I would see the door greeters go with out lunch or break.

I also enjoyed working the registers and working the layaway department some of the job requirements were challenging and I enjoy that.  The management, however, was a bit hard to understand sometimes.  For instance one day they would tell you that you were required to do something and then the next they would change policy on it (coupons, etc.) without much direction.  Also corporate offices would tell you one policy and the store would say it was not correct, which eventually lead to me loosing the job.  The co-workers and I many of them became friends and would look out for each other even became friends out side of the job still stay in touch with them.

"Not Amazing, but Not Bad Either.","I have worked for the company for several years and I find that the issues that most associates and customers have generally have to do with micromanagement and scheduling. Generally when customers do have complaints it's usually well founded and related to the lack of staffing that as of late has been a regular ordeal. With that said I think overall it's a great company to work for. They offer tremendous benefits to associates, including  healthcare, 401k plans, and stock purchasing plans. There's also the convenience of being able to easily transfer to another location should you move to another area of the country. Many of their management positions are filled in house, so it's relatively easy to move up in the company, as long as you are dedicated and desire it. Every corporate company will have its ups and downs but I don't regret my time here at all and I would absolutely recommend it to someone looking for a job.",4,Current Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Malvern, AR",4/3/14,2014,4,3

Wal-Mart,"A typical day at work for Wal-Mart overnight is suppose to begin with a group meeting entail the number of trucks delivered overnight and the store expectations for the floor and product being available for customers.

There are tasks for each employees and at time, the amount of time vs. freight on floor don't match.  Myself and a few other employees would start immediately entering the store working, others would wait 20-25 minutes around until the meeting would begin.  I would work 5-6 pallets of retail onto the floor and a few pick packs which were additional products that was needed to make the shelves full that wasn't delivered on the truck.  The management at Wal-Mart wasn't exceptional at all, I have to say it was the most unorganized company I've ever worked for, the managers would micromanage and talk about over employees.  The co-workers were all diverse, some would actually work and do their jobs, others would drag around and talk with other workers and not get any production.  The hardest part of the job was the management for me, the managers were horrible and just the way that the business was ran in general.  I was told that the store was over budget and that in order for the managers to get their bonus for the year, the store budget had to be cut.

Uncaring management and sketchy customers,"Almost everyone has said terrible things about Wal-Mart, and almost all of them are true. My store was one of the better ones to work at, but it was still terrible. I worked as a customer service associate, and the worst part about the job were the customers who were trying to scam you. Management tries to act as if we're the front line against people who are trying to rip us off, but whenever we come to them with a legitimate worry about the return or money center transaction the customer is asking us to perform, 9/10 times management will make us do it anyway. Management doesn't listen. All they care about are their scores, their bottom line. They don't care if I hate cashiering, and that's why I begged to be put on service desk. If there are 9 cashiers scheduled, but only 7 show up, you can bet either I or one of the other customer service associates will be put on a register, even if there are no lines. It's all because management has these score cards, and if they aren't good... Well, honestly, I don't know what happens. They never tell us. They just tell us what to do because it'll ""affect [their] score card,"" whether or not it's actually necessary._x000D__x000D_Like I said before, there are customers that come in with items they almost certainly didn't buy and want to return. They try to give you some sob story about their mom or grandmother who's old and bought them for their kids, and of course she doesn't have the receipt because she's old and lost it, and no, you can't look up the receipt because she bought it in a different state or doesn't know the day she bought it.

Walmart Review,"I started out as a cashier/cart pusher. After about a year, I ended up working at the Customer Service Counter. A few months later, I worked on the sales floor stocking and refilling shelves, bagging fish for customers, making sure the aisles of the Pet Department were clear and clean, while still keeping the floors spotless. After a few month here, we got a new General Manager who pressed upon me the importance of needing more people to work overnights, and the General Manager really wanted me to switch shifts. After being bombarded for a few nights, I decided to work overnights. I shortly quit a few months after that because the General Manager failed to keep his word which was that he would switch me back to working the dayshifts within 6 weeks of me working overnight.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Oxnard, CA",3/28/14,2014,3,28
Great place for work,I believe Wal-Mart logistics is a great place for work. They offer flexible work schedule with fair compensation and benefits. It makes huge difference if you are a full time student. People working there are some of the nicest people always willing to help not just each other but community where they live. Most of the managers are very competent and willing to help everyone to improve themselves. _x000D_The only reason i gave this company 4 stars is because i am looking into going in a completely different career. I just finished my masters degree and in order for me to stay with the company and do the job i want i would have to relocate to a different state.,4,Current Employee,Systems Operator ,"Raymond, NH",3/28/14,2014,3,28

While I think management is very friendly, I do not find them to be approachable or helpful.  My co-workers are very friendly and knowledgeable for the most part.  But I have seen a lot of short cuts taken.  The hardest part of the job would be learning the different ways in which to do things.

"Great co-workers, but shady management team","My time at Wal-Mart has been great, but due to a few factors I feel it is now best for me to take what I've learned elsewhere to better myself. Within my Wal-Mart store the managers claim they are there to help you advance which is somewhat true. When they are ""helping"" you advance they really just work you down, expecting you to attain the unattainable in one shift when you would actually need about 2 or 3. Being with the company for 4 years now I must say that I look forward to seeing my co-workers on a daily, even the management team. its that I dislike anyone there I just feel that some people shouldn't be in the positions they are in because they are ineffective to there department supervisors and sales associates. while working here I've been taught the importance of customer service, the ability to maintain an inventory in multiple departments, and how to operate some power lifting equipment.

The call center is most times busy with customers calling from all over the country with various concerns.,"I have learned quite a bit working for Walmart as a company. Customer Service is very important for the consumers which brings them back time after time. I've learned various skills in assisting the customers and provide all information and details as possible to assure the customer all of their concerns will be addressed and resolved. The hardest part about my job is not being able to resolve and take care of the customers right away in most cases being that in the escalation center, so much can be done with the limited tools provided to the team. I feel that management can be more involved with the associates and build relationships to make the environment more family like.

Okay place to work.,"When I first started at walmart we had a smoke room, an extra dollar an hour for working on sundays, good benefits, and people who had business sense. That all went away.  I quit because I disagreed with the way the company was being run. Most people didn't like their job and ended up being over worked. As an asset protection associate we monitored shoplifting suspects and apprehended them.  Before I quit they pretty much tied our hands so we couldn't defend ourselves and we couldn't get a high dollar stop. O ya and your judged every month on how many you caught so if you didn't catch very many for a few months straight no matter what the reason (many ran, etc.) you would be fired or asked to step down. anyone considering walmart as an employer I suggest you either work elsewhere or work there just long enough to find a better job. They work you to death and they wont tell the average employee this but its an unwritten rule that they will not give the highest yearly raise even if you do excel at your job.",3,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Shawnee, OK",3/24/14,2014,3,24

Why walmart is a bad place to work.,"Through my many years at walmart I have seen it all, I have witnessed managers throwing associated under the bus to save their own butt. I have watched people get a write up for not being able to do obscene amounts of work. people getting write ups because walmart changed their schedule 2 days out causing that person to have a no call no show resulting in a write up. I have told management that there was only one person scheduled for the whole day when normally there is around 6 and of course they refuse to do change it 3 weeks out or even call anyone in resulting in us being behind and get a talking to about how we need to handle the work. just one more example of how bad this company is, our pervious store manager would make people take a week off of work rather then send them to the doctor. Now I'm not sure if this is isolated events or all walmarts are this bad, all i no is i want out please help.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Reno, NV",3/21/14,2014,3,21

I would take in new prescriptions and insurance informations from patients, fill the prescription, and use the resister to process payment from the patient.  I was also responsible for maintaing inventory levels, and replenishing the inventory using multiple vendors.  Another task as to process stock that was recalled or expired and send it back to our vendors for credit.  I learned a great deal at a quick rate as the previously mentions tasks were all new to me.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the work flow as the pharmacy was short staffed.  The best part of my job was helping the patients.",3,Former Employee,SENIOR PHARMACY TECHNICIAN ,"Groton, CT",3/21/14,2014,3,21
Very fast paced job.,every night you clock in and start stocking or setting modular it is based on a time table set by Wal-Mart. Management is ok. I made friends with a lot of coworkers.

Fun working with friendly associates.,"A typical day at Walmart begins with a register assignment as a Cashier.  After two hours a 15 minute break. Perhaps a move to a new location or at the Service Desk.  A one hour meal break is given off the clock.  I learned many things at Walmart including inventory, recyclables, purchase orders, counts on hand, merchandise mods, price changes and ad matching. _x000D__x000D_ The management was for the most part very workable.  Walmart has an Open Door policy in which associates can express ideas or communiate problems.  Our store has a Store Manager and six Assistant Store Managers._x000D__x000D_The co-workers are very pleasant, friendly and hard working.  Walmart's ethics is to respect the individual, serve the customer and strive for excellence. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for the entire day, usually on concrete floors.

Anti-Union company,"Hard to trust a company that tries to brainwash their associates into believing that their managers will represent their best interests.  In the three years I worked there, I was never considered for a sales position because I was one of the few people to come along who was willing to do the worst job in the store.  The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the management rotation - when you were assigned to a manager who typically had contempt for associates it became very difficult to even show up for work.",5,Former Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"La Grande, OR",3/20/14,2014,3,20

Disorganized Place to Work,"I'm not sure if all Walmarts are the same, and by no means am I trying to bad mouth my job, but this one I've worked for overall is quite a frustrating job. The salaried management is unapproachable, disorganized, and not helpful. The way the store is ran overall really is about a 2.5 out of 5. When corporate comes in management acts as if nothing is wrong, but when they leave it's back to the same routine. The story they sell you about moving up in the company is pretty much a lie because they aren't willing to work with you even if you're qualified. The rules they have set in stone for some of the workers are not followed by everyone, creating an unfair workplace. Favoritism is highly shown here. The best thing that has come from this job are the friendships I've made with some other associates and customers and the experience in Customer Service and Marketing.",3,Current Employee,CASHIER ,"Matteson, IL",3/20/14,2014,3,20

At night, unless it was holiday season or a weekend, there wasn't much to do other than 'zone' the department, put away go backs, and complete occasional tasks left by the department manager. Some assistant managers were easy-going and easy to work for, others were rude. Co-workers were easy to work with and mostly friendly.

Work,With Walmart being my first job i learned how to work fast pace and get things done as a team. Management was good they made sure everything was in order.

The Management team on my shift were easy to get along with but always seemed out of the loop when it came to utilizing employees and assets. My co-workers seemed very acceptable to me and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the lack of organization some times on the part of management .

I was only getting paid just above minimum wage for full time 3rd shift, which for a kid with no bills and a 100$ rent, wasn't terrible but it wasn't good for someone to independently live on.

If you absolutely cant get a job then try it, but if you can explore those options.",3,Former Employee,INVENTORY CONTROL SPECIALIST ,"Niagara Falls, NY",3/19/14,2014,3,19
Very fun place to work,"My typical day at Wal-Mart started at 9pm when all the day time cashiers left for the day.  I would start out by cleaning the registers (all 28 of them) and make sure that all the trash was emptied at each register.  After this job was completed to my managers approval I would then start on the stocking.  My co-workers and I would make sure that all of the candy and gum was stocked with what we had.  After that assignment was completed I would them start giving breaks to the other night time cashiers.  Once all this was completed the night time CSM (Customer Service Manager) and I would then go around and start rolling over the registers and the CSM podium.  After this was completed then we would start on the lunches.  After lunch I would then go out to the floor and help stock shelves until it was time to do a cart run or until it was time to go home.  While working for Wal-Mart I learned a lot of different things including how to be a CSM which is no easy task.  It was difficult at times since management would not always respond to our requests for help.  Night time management was always easier to get a hold of then day time management though.  Nevertheless, I had fun working there and would like to continue through Wal-Mart if possible.  However, at this time it just is not possible.  The one thing I do miss about my Wal-Mart in Montana are my co-workers.  We really bonded and it was like my second family and working with them was a great honor.",5,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Billings, MT",3/19/14,2014,3,19
"Easy, quick, and comfortable company to get into ;)","I had worked at Walmart a few times, as most people do when it's not looking good as usual. I enjoy all this company has to offer especially for people in need of a job A.S.A.P. However, I would not recommend working night shift here unless you are single with no children, because they beat you down mentally and phisically. Have a strong will and can take a beating! Do not give 100% because they will expect that and more, but I believe you shouldn't at any job. Employees come and go at Walmart quicker then the interview is over, which may leave you with the brunt of the work. Managers are my main issue with working for Walmart, from my experience they won't hesitate to break you down to fill their quota and don't hold your breath for new hires to help out considering paperwork is not their specialty. As well as people who have frequented over nights do not want to return. You are supposed to move up quickly in the company which may not be the case, especially if you are an over nighter whom they have a tight grip.

The management here was very professional. All unanswered questions that I had, were answered by management with full detail. The co-workers here were very diverse and helpful. The hardest part of this job was making sure all products were being stacked properly and in the right locations. Also the unloading of the trucks were often a tough time.

Walmart Review,"A typical night at work consist of going to the meeting first thing then being scheduled to a certain area the stock freight.  I learned how to stock freight to shelves, the back room process, and how to use our task manager and hand held.  Management was less than helpful.  They were rude and disrespectful even to the customers.  They talked about team work and such things, but when it came right down to it they expect a select few people to get the work done.  My co-workers were lazy and did as little as possible, and expect someone else to help them every night instead of doing their own work.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers egos'.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was time to go home.

"Typical job, nothing special.","Wal-Mart is not a bad place to work, many find the job enjoyable and rewarding. In truth I myself used to find the job quite enjoyable. However in the past three years it has gone from being a great place to work, to being somewhere dreadful to work. Management used to work with you to find out your availability and respect the fact that many of their employees attended school. That is now a thing of the past. Should you submit your limited availability now, the store manager can deny it, which means you will be scheduled anyway. This creates stress and a horrible atmosphere because of the stress, where once an open door policy provided an opportunity to connect with your supervisors to solve problems it has now become a revolving door of complaints and stressful conversations. _x000D__x000D_Day to day, most of this is not a big deal. In the longrun, it has made what once was a good place seem like any other big retail company that does not care about their employees. As a result, customer satisfaction and service has also dropped to an all time low. _x000D__x000D_One last note. Walmart is constantly advertising that they are hiring, even though most of their part time employees are getting less than twenty-five hours a week and their full time employees are barely keeping their full time status. Why is the company hiring if they can't give hours to the people they already employ? Then turning around and telling those seeking extra hours that there are no hours to give._x000D__x000D_I have tried not to be too harsh in this review.

poor management,working as a sales associate for them was good work experience reason being that you are always meeting different types of people. co-workers normally talk contently on how bad they hate it there and less time actually helping the customer correctly. most of the managers just simply did not care for you at all and i mean what so ever. the hardest part would have to be actually going to work mentally.,2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Greeley, CO",3/19/14,2014,3,19
Terrible corporate culture,"Walmart management employs threats of punishment as motivational tools.

Overnights at Walmart,"Our night really gets started at 12:00 A.M. when all of the customers are officially out of the store. We get the music started and our hard work begins. Most people would see this as a easy job were you don't have to try to get things done but this is where they go wrong, every overnight associate gets put into a department where they are required to get done in a certain amount of time. We have a program called my guide which sums up our tasks on where we are supposed to be throughout the store and how long we have to do so. Bangor Wal-mart, being the most popular Wal-mart in the New England we have a lot to do each night whether its filling up the shelves, changing around feathers, zoning (cleaning up the store and making sure the shelves look neat) and the list goes on. I learn something new everyday, and meet all kinds of daily customers every night which is probably my favorite part of the job. I work with some really awesome people, but some keep to themselves because they are probably not happy with the 10 P.M. to 7 A.M. schedule.

"Work Hard, Good Learning Experience, Low Pay","I had been a say at home mom with my children and Walmart was the only place that called me back. I was more than qualified for the position but I needed to get back in the game. I started as a cashier and I was very quickly promoted. They do believe in promoting from with-in, in just over a year I was a Department Manager. I had been in accounting and customer service manager. However my last promotion was a struggle because it seems getting a promotion can be a challenge for some and I did encounter that. Even though I am somebody that catches on VERY quick and is always looking for new things to learn, I was going to get passed up because the Store Manager that was 6 months older than myself said I was too young to take that position. I worked harder to prove myself and I did get the position. My co-workers and those I supervised that truly thought I deserved stood behind me and were so encouraging and said the same to the store manager. They were all like working with a big family.

I'd not worked directly with a customer-base before, and found helping people find what they were looking for or redirecting them to where they could if the store didn't have what they needed incredibly gratifying.  Management was fairly hands-off, trusting that employees knew what they needed to do and letting them take care of business as needed as the night continued, only stepping in as needed or to provide general checkups on the goings-on in the store.  The job itself was fairly simple, but as with anything that didn't hold true all the time, and there were occasional mixes with where employees were working every night, and working in an area that was unfamiliar or that was filled with products I had no personal use for and still fulfilling my obligations to excellent service made it difficult to answer questions that were asked, at least until I had sought out and asked them of someone more knowledgeable.",3,Former Employee,Dry Grocery Stocker/Cashier ,"Ogden, UT",3/18/14,2014,3,18

Worst Job in my life,"A typical day at walmart consists of 5 seperate bosses each telling you to do different tasks.  There is no structure and absolutely no training for your job.  Day one you will be sent to do tasks with no training whatsoever.  There are individual good people at walmart.  The problem is the culture at the company turns those good people into robots.  People do not use any form of respect when dealing with their employees.  The focus points that should be used are not and they are more worried about things that make them look good rather than what is good for the customer.  If products are not on the shelf customers cannot purchase them.  Yet they are more concerned with displays than availability.  A multi-billion dollar company should add more manpower at each store.  If they did walmart could double their business with proper staffing and product availability.  Customer service would be higher, satisfaction would be higher, the stores would look nice.  In the long run spending the money on the labor and training would help.  They lose far too many talented people due to work conditions and laughable pay.  If a company took care of their employees, those employees would be happy at work, and want to go the extra mile for the company and the customer.  They are complacent with minimal staffing, select products being available, and in a round about way forcing the customer to select certain items due to shelf availability.",1,Former Employee,Sales associate ,"Blairsville, GA",3/18/14,2014,3,18

An average workplace,"This Walmart, in particular, had a reputation for being a high-theft store. However, the security there was top notch and were eager to catch anyone stealing, harassing the employees, use weaponry, and etc. But what got my attention was that during the time that I was working there, there were not enough cashiers. The customers were constantly aggravating all of us cashiers. In fact, dealing with the customers with an always professional attitude was the hardest part of my job. My co-workers didn't always have attitudes but when they did it was because of the customers. However, I did enjoy the salary and how i was able to keep my job during the whole summer. Normally my hours took up my whole day and sometimes most of the week so I did not have any time to myself. Nonetheless, an average day at work consisted of multiple customers, some of them with an excess amount of items in their cart, and some customers that are just downright rude because they try to make up prices.The customer service managers were probably the busiest of the employees and were going place to place.

When finished stockers bring back overstocked merchandise to the backroom to be labeled and binned into their appropriate areas. 6 o'clock a.m. is usually crunch time for the entire store. Stockers must have all overstocked items back to the backroom and have all their aisles zoned and ready to go for customers.

Could have more structure and be more organized,"A typical day for me is opening the shop at 7 a.m. (provided that I can find a manager available to come unlock the doors on time, which in most cases very difficult) sometimes there are customers waiting and the day can begin at a fast pace right away. Through out the day I change oil, tires, and batteries. Along with performing flat repairs, tire rotations, fuel injections and also writing up vehicles for customers or helping them order the right tires. In between servicing vehicles the shop is cleaned and tools are put in their proper places along with removing used tires and batteries and putting them outside in the correct cages (as long as we can get in contact with a manager to come unlock the cages which rarely happens as it should, a lot of the time we are left waiting all day for them not to show up.) Management, in all honesty could use a lot of work. There isn't a lot of structure or planning with them and most of the time they ask for 5 different tasks to be done at once, including working in completely different departments instead of the assigned area. Also it seems that they forget that there is a Tire and Lube department at my store, which has led to a lot of stress and issues. The hardest part of the job would have to be, dealing with management because as I have said more structure is needed. The most enjoyable part is working with my co-workers, everyone seems to get along well and works hard together.",3,Current Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Gordonsville, Va",3/14/14,2014,3,14

Good Starter Job,"Walmart was a good place to work to a certain extent, being that it was my first job. I learned several different job positions during the time that I was there. They have what they call cross training and that's what they do in order to help you learn more of the store. The only downfall to this, is if you work in an area that has a higher paygrade than you, you won't get paid the difference. _x000D__x000D_I will start off by saying that I started off as a Cashier, then I later was cross-trained in Customer Service, Money Center, Stocking, TLE Cashier, and Lawn and Garden. Later on I took a position overnight on Overnight IMS or Inventory Management (Backroom). _x000D__x000D_Walmart is comprised of many different job positions that they rank in tiers which determines your rate of pay and pay cap salary. Those tiers range from 1-7 if I'm not mistaken or maybe 8, but 6-8 are entry level management positions. _x000D__x000D_Scheduling at Walmart is consistent if you work overnight or you work IMS. Your days never change nor do the times. Entry Level management is just about the same unless they have to do an overnight reset. All other associates their schedules are based on the managers discretion as well as availability.  Typically most people average 24-33.50 hours a week part time. And 34-40 full-time. _x000D__x000D_Management at Walmart is always going to be strict and the pay is very minimal for what you have to deal with. You get a raise once a year,  unless you happen to change a job position that is higher and you obtain a raise there.  I can't tell you the specific amount, but I can say that it's in cents not - more...",3,Former Employee,Overnight Inventory Manager ,"Clarksville, TN",3/14/14,2014,3,14

"Productive and fast, easy workplace","Every night I walk into my job I never know what to expect because every night is different and I never know what my tasks will be until I come in that night.

I love the people I work with that is a bonus they are all great people and very helpful when needed. I think that the hardest part of the job is when you try the best that you can to help a customer but don't fulfill their needs such as if we are out of something that they needed or we do not have what they are looking.

Customer driven work environment.,"A typical retail environment. I did my best to keep up to date on knowledge of the products we sold and making sure that our products we stocked to the best of my available abilities. The management was half and half. You had the great ones that would work along side of you and help direct you in the direction you wanted to head. Then there were the more common ones that ""lead"" from the back offices and were more concerned with numbers. The co-workers were what made the days great occassionally you had a few that would rather talk to their friends their entire shift than work but for the most part most of them cared about what needed to be done.

Fun today not so much tomorrow,my typical day at Wal-Mart i would go to lawn and garden to see if they need help with anything outside or any customers had questions or need helped. If lawn and garden was okay i would go to my station at toys to make sure everything was nice and neat. I would also go do back cashiering if needed. I learned that at Wal-Mart the managers don't communicate as much as they should. With it being so many managers sometimes they all will tell you to do something different from the other and then you would have to almost pick which manager you rather have made at you because you couldn't get their task done. The hardest part about the job was keeping the toy section clean on Sunday. On Sunday it was like the toy section was an after church daycare while the parents shop.

They complained about my speed, which I will admit wasn't fast as some people but I still got the job done. They said I was slow but then proceeded to put me in the Dairy area, which is the most time sensitive place to work since it's gotta be up fast or you know if left warm it'll spoil.

the job you have until you can get a better one,"Being an employee for Wal Mart for over 5 years has shown me more than I ever wanted to know about Wal-Mart.  For me it has been a good overall experience.  It has been flexible enough with my school schedule and has given me opportunity of putting supervisor on my CV.  But I view it as nearly a stepping stone that I will jump off of once I have my bachelor's degree.  Not all stores are the same but I'd like to think (hope) that my store  was one of the bad ones.  I've heard a salaried member of management go through the amount of hours he puts into running his part of the store and when looking at it on a per hour scale, he actually makes less per hour than when he worked on an hourly wage before being promoted.  I've seen these managers put in 60-80 hours a week.  I've seen the store manager stocking frozen foods at 8pm at night when hes been there since 7 that morning.  Also as an hourly associate, your personal evaluation is only as good as the evaluation of the entire store.  You can run an excellent department but if your store is in bad shape, don't expect to get ""role model"" or ""exceeds.""  See for yourself though, if you get an interview you basically have the job unless you fail the drug test or confess to murder.

Average job,"It's a okay job if you need to make a type of income. They train you at the position your looking for but the fast pace can be a little overwhelming. You mostly work at your register but are asked to perform additional tasks. Management is a tad unreliable only when the store is packed.

Look elsewhere,"Being an overnight stocker at Walmart was definitely one of the worst jobs I've had. Don't get me wrong. When I started there and heard from others about how hard it is. I just figured they were just lazy people who were complaining about having to get off their butts._x000D__x000D_Here's the thing: the job is not hard. You just open boxes and put things on shelves where they belong. Mindless work, really. I consider myself pretty physically fit, and I have quite a bit of energy. I worked nights stocking at Walmart and never became exhausted. That said, there is a lot to do and not enough time to get it done. It's not unusual to have 3 pallets full of toys, a rocket cart with more toys then a shopping cart or two full of returns and have the task management tool tell you that this should take an hour and a half or two hours tops. Maybe some people have more experience doing this, but when you are trying to figure out where everything belongs and place it properly (ideally, you are supposed to be aware of how many of each item are facing out and the maximum capacity for each of these items. For instance, a Barbie doll may say 2 rows, maximum of 8 dolls on the rack. This means you put 8 dolls on the rack and only two should be facing out into the aisle.) This is easy enough, but when you're under the time crunch and aren't just trying to throw everything on the shelves, it's tough. Many times, you will try to put something on the shelf only to find that it's already stocked with the wrong thing. You need to move those over or whatever or put them in their place to make room for the item - more...",2,Former Employee,Overnight stocker ,"Edinburg, TX",3/13/14,2014,3,13

fast paced yet fun enviroment to work in,"a typical day at work for me was handling money and answering customers questions. I learned from working with Walmart that its a great environment to see people from different races and cultures come together and mingle and get along. I also learned the importance of teamwork and that it takes more than one person to run a company as such as Walmart. I loved my manger and my supervisors they were very patient with me and answered my questions and concerns that I may have had. my coworkers took me out of my shyness and made me talk to all of them and I appreciate and love them from the bottom of my heart I felt like they were my second family and I don't think they even realize the significance that they played in my life. my hardest part about working at Walmart was money management because money has to be counted just right and cant make a mistake I was nervous about counting large sums of money but I handled it in a professional way and over time I got more comfortable around it. the most enjoyable part of my job was having the knowledge of answering customers questions, I loved when a customer asked me questions because I felt important like I was officially a Walmart sales associate sometimes it felt like are you talking to me just because Walmart was my very first job ever and some moments just felt like a dream and I very grateful to have had this opportunity to work for such a great company",3,Former Employee,sales associate as an employee ,sanford nc,3/11/14,2014,3,11

I will then start pulling out pallets or carts out of the freezer and worker the merchandise to the floor. If I have any over stock I will prep and bin it if I have any space in the bins to put it, but if not I would work bins (pull merchandise out of bins) to make space and get what I can off of the floor that day.

For example, I got questioned a lot where to find things, I can easily instruct them where the product is located or the product they're wanting and I have never heard of it, I politely asked them if they can tell me more about the product information, I can easily look it up in the system or ask a supervisor.

A fun place to work and a great learning experienc,A regular day at Walmart  is checking returns from the front the customers left or didn't want and take them to be claimed out then rotate and put out the milk and eggs. After that is done then I work fright from the truck from the night before if not then I work from the bins in the store where we put items that were overstock from earlier days. While doing this I might have to help my managers out with some of their objectives for that day. I also may change a couple displays if they are needed. I do this everyday all day with a little bumps with the managers asking to do other things and before I go home I have to make sure the eggs and milk is filled. The co-workers and nice and mostly easy to get along with. They help you with your job with you are in need of help and I return the favor when it is need.

Overall Exerperice,"Typical day at Wal-Mart was meetings, making schedules, helping customers, helping in other departments, cleaning backroom from night before truck, changing out mods etc. I loved my co-workers we worked well together and miss working with them. Hardest part of the job I would say pleasing the managers. Working at there you never work in your own department. When we go in the call us to backroom to clean up the truck from night before then we had to go and help put out stock by time we finish it already lunch then after lunch we get a list of notes to be completed by end of the day which is only about 3 hrs left in day. I always gave 110% even though they made us feel that we wasnt doing what we needed to do to get the work done. We had to try to complete their page of notes while helping customers and doing our everyday things in the departments to get done. So we learn to multitask a lot. I loved being a manager I miss it so much I loved the people and I loved helping people. I would say that is what I miss most about my job. I miss the satisfaction of my people doing a good job and could pat them on the back with a smile.",3,Former Employee,Dept. Mgr ,"Pembroke, NC",3/10/14,2014,3,10

Most nights I had about 30 people working.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Live Oak, FL",3/10/14,2014,3,10
I learned a great deal from this job.,"In the beginning of my job at Wal Mart, I typically stood at a register for 8 hours and scanned customers purchases.  I enjoyed the actual physical job of scanning and without even realizing it, I picked up the 10 key in record time.  After some time there, I was then taught layaway, and clothing depts, and was moved where needed.  I was then taught to be a back up customer service manager, and I learned to fix register errors, deal with unhappy customers, and get the money the cashiers needed when they were running low.  Additionally, I learned how to become a member of the hiring committee, and interviewed potential new hires, took on the safety committee, and was training. I also went and learned new store set ups. Management at the particular store I worked at was mostly unavailable, and often temperamental.  Eager to let me learn and work in multiple positions, including higher paying ones, but unwilling to pay me for my knowledge and willingness.  Sadly, the co -workers, though most were very nice, were unhappy with the job and their treatment by management, so it showed in the store and to the customers.  I think that giving 100% for so long, getting extra responsibility and trust, yet not being compensated was the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning how to interview potential employees, and knowing my opinion was important.",2,Former Employee,Clerk ,"Manhattan, KS",3/10/14,2014,3,10

Okay place to work.,"A typical day at work was very busy and hectic. I learned a lot!! Management was completely awful! I only speak about certain managers because some were exceptionally great but there is some I would think how exactly are they managers because they don't do anything!! Some of the managers wouldn't even care if a customer needed help they would make one of the cashiers do something within the store when the lines at the register were backed up. I felt like some of the managers didn't know how to deal with their employees and some weren't fair with employees. My co-workers were by far the best I have ever worked with!! I loved some of my co-workers and miss them dearly! The hardest part of the job was trying to keep my mouth shut when it came to the rude customers!! The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to visit with my fellow co-workers! I will say on my first evaluation I did get a raise so that was good and the other part I hated about this job was that it felt like the schedule was poorly created because some days we would be over staffed and other days we would be extremely short handed.

I should have tried harder to communicate with the managers about my anxiety due to my lack of substantial training. It was my first job and because I didn't feel the connection with my managers, I don't think I excelled to my fullest potential. It was quite a learning experience.

My Summary of Walmart,"A typical day at Walmart starts when you enter your department and find out what primary tasks managers want you to complete and you review your secondary tasks and prioritize them. For me, I primarily worked the 11am to 8pm shift. I would come in, get freight from the meat freezer into the bakery department and label it with inventory stickers, then decide if I needed new freight on the floor or if it needed to go into our bakery freezer as back up. Once all freight was cleared off the floor, I would make a list for the floor to pull from the bakery freezer and process the freight to the sales floor. Then, I would begin the CVP (Customer Value Program) process for discounting the next days products going out of date, mark off todays discounted items that did not sell, and pull to the sales floor the new discount items on the approved racks. Then I would trailer list the out of dates for the current day for Manna food program. Any out of dates that are damaged must be thrown into organics and thrown into the organics dumpsters by 7:30pm. I would then box up the undamaged out of dates into Feed America boxes, take to the frozen department freezer and place them on the Manna pallet for collection on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings. I would then come bake to the bakery department and clean any work space that I had dirtied or looked like it needed to be wiped down again (counters, floor, drains, and bread slicer) and take out the trash and card board that had accumulated throughout the day to the trash compactor or the baler.

terrible place to work,not a good employer differentiate between races in the workplace. Managers are very rude and they talk about people in the workplace in front of the customers. They are very rude when people ask them to help them find an item in the store. _x000D_That is with people of color. I would not recommend this as a good place of employment.,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Fort Wayne, IN",3/5/14,2014,3,5
"Enjoyable co-workers, plenty of new learning opportunities.","I have learned different techniques to solve problems as well as finding out information about products in the store. There are all kinds of people that I come in contact with everyday, there is always at least one way to connect with them to give them a good experience. Talking to and helping each person always provides a new way to assist the next person in the future. The hardest part of the job is finding a way to keep busy. Being a cashier at the business requires a person to stand in one general area for an entire shift, with multiple people handling their own areas, you run out of things to keep you moving. By far, the most enjoyable part of the job are the people that I work with. We are all from around the same areas so we have been in contact with each other at some point prior in our lives or know the same people.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Beardstown, IL",3/5/14,2014,3,5

Steady and fast paced environment,"a typical day at work involves answering any questions customers/cashiers may have. We interview people for the cashier, people greeter,and stockman positions. We push credit cards and product care plans to exceed our bottom line. Ive learned you need patience to work as a supervisor and you always listen to the customer. You must find someone to help them and answer their questions. Management is fairly decent depending on who your speaking with. Some are more apt to answer your questions and not make you feel uncomfortable doing it. Our co-workers vary you will never have a perfect team but they all do what is expected of them and they know the coaching for improvement will come if they dont. The hardest part of my job is upsetting the customers. Especially when there is nothing you can do for them and you have to deny them. I enjoy making the customers day. When they come in upset and leave with the biggest smile and compliment me and tell me ive been a big help.",4,Current Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER ,"Scarborough, Maine",3/5/14,2014,3,5
Very productive work place with (I think) the best customers.,"A typical day at Walmart would be clocking in then reading my tasks. Most likely there would be a truck to unload so of course me and a few team members were the designated pullers. I would do that and then go stock and clean my isles.

different to say the least,I start the day by having a meeting with store manager. He gives us notes to complete for the day. Then I walk my pad as well as my partner's pad with the ZMS and dept. managers and give them my notes to complete during the day._x000D_ What I have learned from Wal-Mart is they have a different way of doing things. It is very fast paced and your features change weekly if not daily. _x000D_ Management at Wal-mart are hands on which is one of the things I like most about the job. My co-workers are great. We work together as a team to get tasks accomplished._x000D_The most enjoyable part of my job would be working hand in hand with my direct reports and learning from them. _x000D_The hardest part of the job is getting all the things that I want to accomplish today completed today.,3,Current Employee,Assistant manager ,"Boutte,La",3/5/14,2014,3,5

hostile work place,senior management create a hostile work place to prevent growth,3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Bakersfield, CA",3/5/14,2014,3,5
A terrible place,"While Walmart professes to be a place of equal opportunity for all, it is anything but that. There are two cultures and classes. One is the salaried management, the other are the hourly associates. The management follows an almost cult-like devotion to the regional and home office, above and beyond what is normally found in other coperate cultures. Reading and studing the sayins of ""Mr Sam"" is encouraged. Standard answers and phrases are used in dealing with employee problems. The number one goal is manipulating and lying to the associates to get the most amount of work from them at the least possible pay. _x000D_ The hardest part of working there is that the work never stops.  The more you accomplish, the more is asked of you until it is impossible to get it all done. Walmart threatens and finds reasons to terminate anyone who talks about unionizing, as it does with people who get sick or injured while on the job.  As an example, if you need medical leave, you are told your job will be held for six weeks and then you will be permanently replaced.  If you do come back, management claims it will find you soomething to do, but not at the same level you left. Federal law requires companies to provide 90 days of short term medical leave. Walmart does what it wants and then dares employees to do anything about it._x000D_ In short, unless you are a manager who enjoys blackening souls and crushing dreams, or you are someone who desperatly needs work, stay away from Walmart. It will only end in tears.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager/Sales and Inventory Associate ,"Hastings, MN",3/5/14,2014,3,5

"A good job, but certain managerial complaints need to be addressed.",A typical day at work would be to greet the associates that you supervise in the workplace and others.  I will receive my notes from management at about 11 am to finish by 4 o'clock.

Fast paced and fun workplace,I learned a lot working at Wal-Mart for four years. I started working in their jewelry department as a Christmas temp. and was one of three people that were able to hire on. From there I was moved and promoted multiple times throughout the store which gave me a chance to learn how each department of Wal-Mart functions and what their responsibilities are. The thing I enjoyed most about working for such a company was that everyday was different from the last because of the different type of merchandise we would receive and the different types of customers that entered our store. I also enjoyed the fact that my job was very fast paced and I had a lot of creative freedom to do what was in my best belief would up my sales.,4,Former Employee,Zone Merchandise Manager ,Wal-Mart,3/5/14,2014,3,5

Making sure the cashiers received there breaks. If any register needed a loan, money exchange, or key turns, I was there to help. Also I had to audit registers that was either short or long the previous day. Depending on my schedule, I had to open/close store.

Great Job with Great Hours. However....,"The hours are very good. On average I made about 42 hours because Walmart gets so busy that you would probably stay over later than your scheduled shift.

The majority of the other employees are happy to be there and enjoy their day, but there's always those couple of people that never seem to be happy. _x000D_There is currently a lack of employees, which makes the burden on the rest of the front end feel significant, as many cashiers and customer service managers are forced to pick up the slack outside and in other areas around the store.",4,Current Employee,Deli Sales Associate ,"Ellsworth, Maine",3/1/14,2014,3,1

Wally World!!,The company of Walmart itself is wonderful if you want to advance and work your way up the ladder.

hard work for low pay,"Walmart is far from the greatest job you will ever have.  They make you do a lot of work for not a lot of pay.  I have been there 5 years and they still wont hire me as full time so I don't get any insurance unless I buy it (which you can only do in October). They expect you to work overtime when its busy but are fine with cutting you down to 24 hours or less when they are not busy.  They talk a lot about how they do profit sharing every quarter but you will be lucky to get $20 if anything at all.  You have multiple managers on any shift and often they all want you to do different things for them because apparently they don't talk to each other, and many of things they have you do will seem counter productive.  I have a whole lot of complaints about walmart that I cant even fit into this review but the one good thing is that if you work there long enough or if you get promoted high enough the pay is pretty good, and it is usually pretty hard to get fired unless you don't show up or make the managers mad.  Also there are some pretty nice people that work there.",2,Current Employee,Inventory Management Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",2/28/14,2014,2,28
Good company but at the end of the day never really felt I met my goals.,"Started the day by checking cart aisles to see which side of store was low on carts. Start off by collecting carts on the lowest side of store so every customer would have a cart for shopping. Learned how to use machinery on first day to help retrieve carts. The manager was super busy with work that I only contacted her if there was an emergency. I didn't really have any coworkers to work with as some were either repositioned, quit, or fired. Hardest part was coming back from lunch with no one to cover my position. Asked for help every time before going off to lunch but help never arrived until customers notice carts were unavailable to them. Most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers due to the little break in my routine.",3,Former Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Palm Desert, CA",2/28/14,2014,2,28

I learned a lot from working there in the short time that i was there. They teach you a lot so you are a well rounded person and can work in any section of the store. At Walmart when you work overnight you get two fifteen minute breaks and an hour for lunch which was awesome. The most enjoyable part of my job was all my co-workers who worked with me.

Everyday at Wal Mart was a unique experience.,"A typical day at Wal Mart consists of a meeting at 8:30 with all Merchandise Supervisors to distribute daily notes.  At 9:30 there would be a store meeting where we could learn about daily sales and anything going on within the Company.  After the 9:30 meeting I would work on completing notes and gathering information for features and filling outs.  Also I would make sure all freight was worked and returns were picked up from the service desk.  If there were mods or price changes, these were also priorities duing this time.  At 2 pm, there was a meeting with the Assistant Managers and Store Manager to follow up on daily notes and plan the freight that would be coming in that night.  After the meeting until 4 or 5pm I would use the My guide program to assign evening tasks and work on SWAS plans.  In addition I would check on returns and tour with a department manager going over upcoming mods, price changes, freight, features, and outs.  I learned how and what features to plan for seasonally and what features were good to plan for ""everyday"".  I also learned about crowd control, how to satisfy difficult customers, how to mix paint, sell fishing and hunting licenses, how to operate commercial fryers, how to maintain cooked food (holding and cooking temperatures), how to order and inventory milk, and I learned how to pierce ears.

Not a true family oriented company,This company has become the total opposite of what it was originally when I first started working for them. I advanced quickly from an unloader to management. In a typical day the facility is understaffed and the management is not consistent with the company policies and the execution of them. I was able to advance my management skills but was also held back at the same time. The relationships built were the best part of the company. The insecurity of your job as a member of management is the worst part I had to deal with besides the lack of staff to complete daily tasks. The company is not the family orientated vision that it was when I first hired on with them. I could not enjoy any holidays as a manager due to company restrictions on when you use vacation.

My job was not that difficult but I will say the hardest part was keeping up my scan per hour (SPH) score since I was not a regular cashier. SPH was how many items you can scan per minute and the more items you scan in a minute, the higher your scan. However, this challenge encouraged me to try to keep my score up as much as I could have when I did go to help out on register. Overall, management was good.

I work with some really great people in the bakery.,"I start my day checking the department for outs and lows. I have to do the markdowns. Make sure donuts and baking are getting done. Have meeting with Assistant Manager or Zone Manager to see what is on the agenda plus also making sure floor is getting stocked. I do price changes and the ordering. I have learned you have to have patience and keep your cool. Things get hectic at times, or day doesn't go like you had planned it. You just step back a minute readjust your plans and then proceed. Sometime you have one manager telling you to do one thing and then another coming along and telling you to do just the opposite. I don't like that much. I don't mind doing my job and I have respect for my managers but it seems they have a lack of communication. The hardest part is when someone calls in. We are low staffed anyway so it is really hard when everyone is not there. All the work still has to be done. I love working in the bakery.

"Largest Retail Corporation, Good Work, Bad management","The top says it all. Walmart is a good starter job for most, a good job  if you can work your way up to management. But for most or all that have worked there 99% will say that the store managers are just not good at what they do. Either they have a click going on or have ""favorites"" they get into first no matter if you work the hardest or been there 15 years. Its sad that this still goes on. II went from Produce to photo lab in 6 months but had to take a 25 cent pay cut? Why? Stocking shelves compared to selling cameras and using complicated equipment that's just non sense. Since it was a small area i worked in and i was the new guy on the black i can understand  people don't want to teach you anything or be helpful till you can ""prove yourself"" in the job your at. Well So i did but when i was picking up things faster than some, the people that have been working in the photo department were to say the least ""upset"" cause i was able to pick up the job very quick. I had to due to the fact they had only giving me a week and a day to get off training and be prepared to be alone with dozens of customers who are all anxious to receive their product. I enjoyed my job even though nobody liked me in my department and even though i would help electronics when they needed it. That is where i wanted to go in the first place but again due to management they had their favorites and i wasn't able to  get that sales position for whatever reason. Overall it was good experience for me to deal with the public and learn customer service. But for most people i recommend that either make friends - more...",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Fredonia, NY",2/23/14,2014,2,23

Good first job; Straight forward job tasks,"For the most part a typical day at work consists of gathering carts and refilling the cart bays, but also at the same time helping out with customer questions and carry outs. This job teaches a lot about how to deal with lots of weather conditions mainly the heat, cold and rain. Management in the upper ranks are satisfactory but the lower ones could be a little more understanding when it comes to the certain situations. For example, if we are short handed and we have one person collecting carts for a whole store they could be more understanding that we are trying our best and working through our breaks to try keep up the rushes we get. That would also be considered one of the hardest part of the job is trying to meet the demands of the store when we are short handed.

Management in Walmart will change after a certain amount of time so the caliber of management would change frequently so I would have to deal with many styles of leaderships and attitudes. When I first started working for the company the constant change in leadership and in changes in expectations was a little difficult at first but it helped me handle change to now I see that as a strength that I can adapt to new and changing areas in my work.

In my particular store we had Sr. Management talking behind co-workers as well as employees backs.  Making fun of employees for various reasons handicapped, personal attacks etc. I found this behavior repulsive and ultimately the reason I chose to leave Walmart. They say not all stores are like the one I was assigned to.  In my observation as a shopper at Walmart I would occasionally talk to employees while shopping.  I would say 75-80% of the people I talked to were dissatisfied employees for one reason or another.  I also don't need to mention the low pay Walmart pays their associates.  It is an extremely tense working environment and the the low pay doesn't help.  Medical and Dental benefits are less than desirable.

"Co-workers are a delight to work with, but managers are rude","I worked for WalMart for a little over a year, only because I was a college student. The head managers are rude and act as if they are not human and do not understand the needs of their associates.  Walmart tries to work you hard for minimum pay. A typical day in the summer is very uncomfortable, not only to customers but to associates as well. It's been plenty of times I felt light headed because of the amout of heat in the building. What I learned from working for Walmart is they are more focused on making money than their associates well being. They rather you come in to work and risk spreading your cold to others than stay home and rest.  My co-workers where the main reason I stayed for so long. They are very positive, fun to be with, and motivivating. The hardest part of the job in my opinion would be dealing with rude customers, but hey that's retail. Some customers really belittle you as if you owe them something because you work at Walmart. Oh let's not forget how some of the racist people that come there as well.  I've been called a woman of ""my color"". I have been cursed at multiple times for things not being available in the store, likes its my fault. I have spoken to customers and they do not speak back. Lets please nit forget the customers that get mad when your light is off and you tell them you're closed. The worst part is the customers that throw their money on the counter when you have your hand out, expect you to pick it up then hand them their change In their hand.

"Valuable first job, much experience to be gained.","I held many different positions while employed with Walmart. While I worked part-time on the day shift, I was a Sales Associate in the Health and Beauty department and my daily tasks included customer service, working small amounts of freight (old and new), creating displays, small efforts in inventory management, and occasionally helping the front end by operating a cash register as needed. Walmart was very understanding of my school schedule at the time and management was generally pleasant. I learned the basics of the Walmart Inventory Management hand-held device, the details of customer service, and a lot of product placement and display technique. The hardest part of my job on the day shift was balancing the work that needed to be done with customer needs. The holidays bring a lot of business and subsequent stress. However, the most joy was brought on by the rare customers that were truly grateful for my help. _x000D_Working overnight is a completely different story. Fewer customers, more freight, less help from co-workers. On the dayshift there could be two to five associates in one department at a time. On the night shift, I was solely responsible for extensive hours of freight in an entire department, plus clean up and the ever-present obligatory duties of a cashier when needed. I went from being a part-time overnight stocker to working for the ""Mod Team"" (the team that resets merchandise throughout the store when required by home office) full time.

Ruined my love for this store,I was not properly trained. At the time I was employed we had no manager and no one working in my department. I still have not been trained properly over four months later. Most managers are rude and take advantage of associates who are honest and do as they are told. The employees use my area of the store to hide their belongings and avoid binning merch in the back. Everyone quits with no warning. It's not Walmart as a whole but just my position and coming in at a very rough time for my store. I get blamed for every problem that goes wrong in my area but the area was messed up long before I arrived and I did not have training to know if anything was wrong or not. I do not get paid enough to do what I do everyday. Mind you that not all departments are this way.

An example of Upper Management problem is them pulling you from your department to work in a department you are not familiar with to provide the same customer service as if you knew the area.

I also learned how to handle money and work in a fast pace environment. I have always gotten along with all of my co-workers, if there is an issue it is usually very easily and quickly resolved. The hardest part of the job was probably having to deal with situations where a manager hadn't fulfilled their job (or even a managers attitude) and having to pick up any slack.

I was even teaching new hires in apparel how to do everything. I was told that if I wanted to move up I had to learn the rest of the store because I only knew apparel and cashiering and I wanted full time so I moved over to deli. Bad idea! The day I moved over there I got in trouble for rolling my eyes when a manger was yelling at another associate in front of me, 3 department mangers and some customers. When I got over there I saw so many things they were doing wrong. When I started to say something about it I was being singled out and watched. That's when management started saying I wasn't cleaning right. BULL**** I took hours cleaning one thing and cleaning it more then once. Then they said I stand around and do nothing. BULL**** number 2 I was always to busy with customers if not with customers then with the fryer. I finally got out of the deli when I sprained my wrist loading an extremely heavy basket of chicken into the fryer. I got put on overnights zoning until my wrist got better but until then management watched me so closely it was ridiculous. Everything  I  did was not good enough for them. I was zoning fast but I didn't do it right so I had to redo everything again, move them to the edge.

I love when I find myself being handed 8 pallets of chemicals with 4 hours to finish while others, it seems slackers get away with everything, get 2 pallets and walk around socializing. The co managers are wackos who'll break down during a meeting crying because they fear they're about to be fired because their employees are SO LAZY!! They don't allow overtime period! They try to keep you under 40 hours continually because they don't want the employees to be able to claim a full time status. Not having a full time status means NO BONUS! Yep, while everyone basks in the glory of a bonus, PT'rs get crapola! I love rounding up carts in below zero weather freezing my ears off while the long timers know how to hide out and stay warm inside. You can never get your boxes into the baler because it's always full and it's up to the stock people, us, to make bales on top of hauling pallets off a truck, putting out our stock and whatever else they throw at us. Co managers refuse to answer employees calls in case they're calling off.

The learning was worth the experience.,"WalMart was a good company to show me how to count cash quickly and efficiently, and how to balance money.

They also used seniority as a tool instead of what person was telling the honest truth.",3,Former Employee,Accounting Clerk ,"Woodhaven, MI",2/8/14,2014,2,8
Hated it!,Used to be a great company to work for when Mr. Sam was alive but went into corporate greed mode. Put caps on salary for every job so if you didn't go into management (which is really  bad) you never got a raise. Don't care about associates any more. Work load was ridiculous.

Walmart,When i show up for work everyone is at the break room. No one shows up on the floor for work until its been 15 minutes in. The workers are really slow and the managers yell at the workers which isn't right. Everyone gets there work done but a very slow place. What i learned at Walmart was how to stock isles and make a bail. The management was terrible they never knew what the employees where up too and they yelled at the employees. The hardest part of my job was when someone wasn't at work you and then taking there work and doing your work in the 8 hours you have.

"The job was challenging, but it worked well. I worked with guns, as well as customer service.","A day at work started with auditing the gun case, doing the counts that were left, price changes, & customer service. It continued with a few gun sales a day, which was a skill you have to do perfectly, or you cannot complete the sale. I learned so much from the store, I learned how to be responsible as well to be a hard worker. I continue to be polite in my everyday life, even when I'm not at work. My co-workers were nice, but I kept my distance just because I feel that is best when you're at work. The hardest part of my job was that I had to keep up to date with my schedules, my managers didn't do regular schedules. It was made 3 weeks ahead of time, & since they switched out managers so often, I never had a schedule, & to pay bills, less than 15 hours a week doesn't help. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact I could make someone's day just by being polite, I love working with people. They make the work field easier, & sometimes harder, but I try my best to make them happy so there is nothing to worry about.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Morgan City, Louisiana",2/8/14,2014,2,8
Able to meet new people and help them with their needs,Some days are slower than others. I have leaned where to locate different items. The communication seems to be lacking.

Good career.,I loved this job and made it a career in a way.  I basically enjoyed my co-workers and some of the managers.  Most enjoyable was helping with photo lab needs.

I enjoyed the challenges but once the company started hiring so many people from the outside who never understood Sam's vision it went down hill fast.  It was very unfortunate to say the least.

Not a good company to work for.,"I was a General Customer Service Associate (Cart Pusher, Stockman, etc.) for 3 years before I accepted another job offer. Wal-Mart may look great outside, but looks can be deceiving, they're horrible inside. The crime rate is tremendously high at that store and the store and company management are doing nothing about it to make it a safer store to shop, there are not enough registers open during the busy hours, they don't schedule enough staff to operate them either, they're always out of items that are hot sellers, the management don't care about the employees, and especially to me either. In the summer they made me sweat in scorching 90+ degree weather without allowing me to cool down and have anything cool to drink, and in the winter they made me shiver in frigid -20 degree weather without allowing me to warm up and have anything warm to drink.

Walmart,"I was able to get a lot of experience working with different kinds of people, from the nicest, to the rudest. Everyday you would have to deal with a situation that was unpleasant, but overall working at Walmart was something I enjoyed. The hardest part of working there was dealing the rude customers. I would close fitting rooms at 10 and customers felt that cause it was a 24 hour store, they had the right to use them, people would be sneaky and try slipping in the dressing rooms. All you can do is be polite and tell them your sorry but not to undress in public and to come back within the dressing room hours of operation.",3,Former Employee,Accessories Department ,"Lynnwood, Wa",2/7/14,2014,2,7

Management would not work with school schedules or care anything about you. crazy work hours and lunch breaks all late.,1,Former Employee,Guide customer ,"San Antonio, TX",2/7/14,2014,2,7
Daily Routine,I would start off a day checking outs and empty shelves on the sales-floor. There is a time constraint so speed is important. After this is done I count those same items to see if we can stock it with warehouse back-stock. Periodically I would finalize counts to make sure that they are accurate before the store manager puts in an order. Also throughout the day we receive very heavily loaded trucks which are loaded with pallets heavily packed and difficult to pull with the manual hand truck provided. I also set-up everyday for the night Merchandise Truck delivery. My co- workers whom I worked directly with in our designated areas also work together with me to accomplish goals.,2,Former Employee,Inventory Associate ,"West Windsor, NJ",2/7/14,2014,2,7
Most of what you hear about working for Wal-Mart in the media is true,"I am sure you have seen/read/heard many things about employment at Wal-Mart, the vast majority of the negative things are true.  I was told when I was hired that they would work around my college schedule, and now I am being told that I either show up when they schedule me or I am fired, regardless of what my availability is in the system.  My Wal-Mart is drastically cutting hours but increasing the workload.

"High paced job that gave a good ""workout""","Just like anything else and anywhere else there were good days and there were bad days. Everyday was the same routine, and although it wasn't what most people would call fun, I liked that it was a bit of exercise and that if there was any ""work-related"" aggression it was definitely a place to move around and get some tension out. I feel that the managers were just like any others, they had their good days and their bad days just like us. The job wasn't what i would consider a ""hard"" job, although it was definitely a strenuous one. The hardest part was the first few days of learning where things go, and the do's and don'ts that you learn from experience. The only real challenges that I myself faced on the job was being tired from the  truck days. The best part of the day was when the guy throwing the truck would yell out ""WE HIT THE WALL!"" Every time we would hear that it would send us into overdrive cause we were ready to go eat lunch. All my coworkers were pretty cool. We all built a little bond back there and it made the job so much easier.",4,Former Employee,Truck Unloader ,"Kannapolis, NC",2/6/14,2014,2,6
minimum wage paying job,My experience with Walmart was an interesting job. My coworkers were fun to be around but could  cause a lot of drama. The hardest part of being a cashier at Walmart wasn't the customers but the customer service managers that didn't care about us having a break or what time our shift ended. I would always have to complain to my general manager about the ignorance of the customer service managers. But I really enjoyed having my lunch breaks and 15 minute breaks.

Vastly undercompensated. Typically Walmart,A typical day as a cashier is basically a lot of repetitive ringing out of customers out who nit-pick and complain about every little thing. I've learned that you can't please everyone no matter how much you try. Management and co-workers are pleasant enough to ease some of the stress and frustration. The hardest part of the job is the boredom and angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the day is punching out at the end of your shift.,1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Tarpon Springs, FL",2/5/14,2014,2,5
Always having work to do,A typical day is having management request tasks before any previous tasks are complete. I learned to do all that I can do as soon as possible.  Learned that no one is super man or woman.  Wal-Mart Management always expecting but not participating in keeping up with all the tasks needed.  The co-workers are all so tired and wishing they could have qualified for a better or different job.  The hardest part of the job is knowing who the problems are and yet not being able to show the solutions.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers when needed.

Fellow associates fun to work with and love the work I do.,"Lately the work environment has become very stressful. Due to understaffing in all departments and the automotive department, I am now required to learn all areas of the store even though I am primarily in the automotive department. We are required to have a certain number of employees staffed in TLE which our management teams doesn't do or seem to care to do. Then they will pull our short staffed people to work in other departments that are short staffed. Its not a problem if we are not busy but they do it also when we are busy creating longer wait times for customers and customer complaints that go constantly unsolved. Wal-Mart is a multi billion dollar company but yet can not keep us up to staff and with the slim staff we have now cut hours to the point where it is hard for us to make ends meet and we are now living paycheck to paycheck.

It can be challenging. Advancement can be slow,"My day begins at 7am. Usually there are two other assistant managers, and the store manager who tours the entire store with myself. We look for roughly several things. Overall cleanliness, whether we have enough products on the counters, if pricing is correct, if sale items are properly displayed so that customers can compare pricing, are a few of the basic areas of focus during the tours. We make notes of things that need addressing both on the sales floor and the back room. Each assistant has an hourly assistant. I usually meet with that assistant so that we can plan ways to complete daily task in addition to any extra task that the store manager needs. We assign these task to various associates, and follow up with them throughout the day. I spend several hours handling administrative items, and customer complaints. Also I plan, with the help of the rest of our team, how to merchandise items to gain maximum sales.

Will work you hard but will pay for every dime,I worked in electronics and I enjoyed selling the products to customers and the rush around Christmas because it keeps on going. I learned plenty about not letting what people say about you get to me because it comes with the territory. Customers and sometimes your co-workers can really strike a nerve and you have to know how to let it go and move on. Management is just like they want to see you work from the time you clock on to the time you clock out. Never look idle or you will work.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"New Orleans, LA",2/4/14,2014,2,4

The management is well atleast the ones i can speak for and all my co-workers are actually very cool but i have a cool personality myself so people tend to like me. theres nothing really too hard at my job for me to complain about because i dont have a hard time doing anything well maybe thats because im 280 and 6'5, but the things i do like about the job are meeting new people because you never know who is going to walk threw that front door hahaha....",4,Current Employee,Associate ,"Austell, GA",2/4/14,2014,2,4

A true learning experience,"What I learned working for Walmart is that it is a world by itself. This company has a difficult time dealing with individuals. Processes change very quickly all in order to make more money. As a sales associate you are required to do whatever the management asks you to do, otherwise in some cases you could get fired. The hardest part of the job was listening to management who chose to put their personal agenda above the good of the store.

Productive workplace and busy weekends,"The job was very hands on and you would always be on your feet all the time. I liked stocking the shelves every once in a while if I was needed to do so. To be my first job, It was the hardest job that I ever had in my life. Pushing large rows of carts every work day  without a machine was hard labor.

Love to browse- different sections. Love the Deli!!,"I enjoyed getting to know most of the people there and really enjoyed the variety of departments I could shop from and additionally enjoyed the food bar for lunch,but thought some of the policies were  ridiculous.For example,as a technician-in-training I got written up for things that were accidents,but no room for forgiveness!! And even certified technicians would be written up for things that were not always under their control,like  accidentally breaking  a sensor in customers tires. You can't always prevent everything!!!!",4,Former Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Meridian, MS",2/3/14,2014,2,3
Always busy,"Sometimes it's hard to jugle everything that needs to be done by all the different managers givng you directions on tasks to complete while still trying to take care of customers. Most of my co-workers are good about helping each other out when they themselves are not stretched out on tasks. For the most part wal-mart is a good place to work. I enjoy interacting with my customers and helping them find what they are looking for or suggesting another alternative to what they may need. I like staying busy; just not overwhelmed. One of the issues that I have learned with all my years at wal-mart is that no two managers are on the same page; you have one telling you that a task needs to be done this way then another comes along and says it should be done that way...double work cause then you have to redo it. I like my job and I have learned many aspects on how to run the operations of a retail store, and how not to. There are always changes in how to we do our jobs each day, some are for the better and then there are some that just makes our work harder to get it all done in an 8hr shift.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Highland Village, TX",2/3/14,2014,2,3

Ensure cashiers where establishing speed and excellent customer service. I learned how to multitask under a very fast pace environment.

True what is said!!,"Everything you hear on tv about it not being a great place is true.  Management does little to nothing to defend you.

Overworked and Underpaid,"Walmart advertizes itself as a company that cares about it's employees but they have yet to live up to that reputation. When employees ask for days off, the management that needs to approve it waits until the last minute to make a decision and then they have a tendency to deny your request saying that they won't have coverage for the position. They under staff the store and they also create ridiculous rules for areas in the store. This company really only cares about making money and will take advantage of you/",3,Current Employee,Customer Service ,"Chesterfield, VA",2/2/14,2014,2,2

The hardest part of the job was when codes changed on different products rapidly. It was also difficult when things were unorganized management wise.

But the manager was reluctant to help, even though it is his job to deal with customers when they ask. They give orders to do something that you are already doing._x000D__x000D_Working conditions are bad.  Walmart is so cheap, they can't even get materials for their employees to work with.

As being a manager I worked with a lot of up-set customers, by talking to them and coming to a happy conclusion to there problems, not once have I had a customer walk away un-happy. The hardest part of my job was trying to be in so many different places throughout the store to make sure associates were staying on task, but I did it. The most enjoyable was working with the associates and helping them to become the person they wanted to be and not brushing them to the side.",4,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Brooklyn Park, MN",1/30/14,2014,1,30
Productive fast pace workplace with focus on customer service,A typical day at work consist of a hard working fast paced environment with a focus on serving my customers whether it be baking bread and donuts or making a cake for them. the co workers are great and fun to work with and always work as a team to meet our objective.

a nice place to work ..,"a typical work day at Walmart especially if you are opening, there is not much customer that goes shopping, but as the afterrnoon comes  then we get busy, and the line starts to grow, Management tries their best to open more register if the line is getting longer, sometimes they hopped on the register and start taking some of your customer if  they are getting anxious and impatient,  your co-workers  doing also the best they can to get the line moving.  the hardest part of this job is to please your customer,  some of them are very rude but there is nothing you can do about it but be pleasant, and smile and apologize if the line is getting longer. specially if there is not enough cashier. the most enjoyable part of the job is when you where able to help someone to stir them to the right direction of the dept they were looking for.  and you just finished your 8 hr shift./",4,Former Employee,CASHIER ,"Las Vegas, NV",1/29/14,2014,1,29

Descent,The work place have its ups and downs. I believe we don't get paid as much as what we deserve in salary. Couple of the co workers are pain to work with sometimes because of their attitude and their way of doing work. The supervisor doesn't know what he is doing and don't know how to put things in details. Some of the members of managements don't do their works the way it should be done. And their is one of them who always seem to be anxiety and always breaks some of the rules. The hardest part of the job is having conflicts between some co workers who cant get alone for certain matters. What I enjoy most about this work is that the most of the people I work with are fun and outgoing people. Even though is this not the kind of job I like to do I enjoy working on it because trying new things and meeting peers never hurts.

I then straighten up my department and then I start stocking my area while I wait for my notes for the day from upper management. The hardest part of my job are the days of bad weather, when there are games on tv or the holidays. Our sandwiches are very popular. The best part of my day are when I can make the call of bending the rules to help a customer in the time of need.

"co workers were great, fun people to be around but management was god awful",typical day at work would be the manager telling me I wasn't working fast enough to meet their standards which are outrageous to say the least. then I would end up doing my job plus some of someone else's job because they were to slow to keep then there were days where I would have to stock two isles with no assistance to be found when I had helped atleast everyone there atleast one time a night. the most difficult part of the is pitting up with the managers they are power crazy idiots who couldn't find their butt with both hands and a map.co-workers were amazing people to be around they would do just about anything to help if they could. the most enjoyable part of the job was smoke breaks just so you could get away from the managers for a bit. if don't smoke before you go to work with Wal-Mart you will most likely start smoking before you quit the job.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Pauls Valley, OK",1/29/14,2014,1,29

My first job.,"A typical day at work would be to Smile at all times so the customer feels comfortable enough to ask or talk to me also to meet new people everyday. I learned how to interact with customers. I was a very shy person but at Walmart I built a lot of confidence, now I can actually have conversations with people. Learned customer service. The hardest part of the job was to be strong around people who try to put you down, because some people will come to you and ruin your day but you have to be strong and ignore them, maybe they aren't having a good day.Management was awesome, they would come early in the morning to make sure everything looks great and would leave late just to make sure everything is right and making sure everyone is doing there job but yet they are also smiling, remembering each associates name that way they feel important. The most enjoyable part of my job was that a lot of people would compliment me and make my day. They all loved my smile. No matter what goes on in my life, I always smiled. But the responsibilities of a cashier was to have knowledge of running a cash register, people skills necessary for interaction with customers.

I talked to many of the co-workers and managers and later started hanging out with them outside of work then I realized everyone has been hanging out with each other for a while so I was kinda late to join the party. When promotions came around they promoted off of who was there favorite rather who's the best fit, and because of this strong favoritism the people that are well liked feel like they don't have to do work.

However, management was sloppy and nothing was well organized or run. Multiple departments were hardly able to complete their daily duties due primarily in part to the failure of the managements to supply man power or required tools.

Walmart is a good place to start off a great career.,"A typical day at work would consist of me cleaning the register I was assigned to and checking customers items in a neat and quick fashion. I learned, with my experience at Walmart, that you have to try your best to be your best. I also learned that I was good at talking to customers and helping them with any questions that they might have. The management at Walmart was passable. I felt that every time I had a customer who needed a member of management they weren't always available. I understood that it might take a minute for a manager to address the customers needs. However, sometimes it would take almost thirty minutes for them to show, when there were multiple managers in the store. My co-workers were very nice and I made acquaintances with most of them that I met. The hardest part of my job was when customers would ask for help to find items. I never strayed past my register most of the time, so when customers would ask me to point them in the correct direction I was no use. I would usually find someone who worked in that department to help the customer or help the customer find the item as best as i could. I really enjoyed being able to interact with the customers and making their time at the check out precise and quick. Over all i would have to say that Walmart is a great place to work.

Very productive workplace especially when I competed against other workers to see who can move the most pallets in a one days time.,"A typical day at work would consist of getting dressed in my freezer gear and start replenishing slots from start to finish. I would repeatedly retrieve pallets from their holding area and place them on the ground for the orderfillers to pick from. I also retrieved full stacked pallets to send to the stores. I learned a lot from this company, and also teamwork and it can benefit or make a production day go completely down the drain. My management team was one of the best the helped us get our day started with stretching and what was expected from us to complete our day. My co-workers were some of the best I have ever worked with most of the time we supported each other but most of the time we were in competition to see who could move the most pallets. The hardest part of working on this job was being in the freezer for sometimes 14 hours a day just to get our day completed.

Typical Job,"This job is what you make of it. The managers will only do what you stay on them to do. No one is going to look out for you, you have to look out for yourself. Starting from the very bottom there are not many opportunities available unless you are there for 4+ years. Even then it is hard to get into another area or on the floor. Being a cashier is very boring, the only excitement out of the day is police and customer thief drama. It is all about the customers and sometimes they converse with you, however you are required to keep doing your job so it is hard to have a conversation at any part of the day other than lunch. The hardest part of the job is staying busy. When things are slow you have to show that you are the best at what you do. Redlining to some managers can still look like you are doing nothing so I suggest to walk around the store picking up trash etc. The most enjoyable part of this job is the relationships that you hold with your team. I have a great team of cashiers and cashier managers that I know will do the right thing, the best part is that they can count on me to do my job.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/ Customer Sales Representative ,Centerville,1/26/14,2014,1,26

"It's Walmart, what else can I say?","I've worked on and off again at Walmart for the last 5 years.  I kept hoping it would be different each time I decided to come back, it wasn't.  It was worse.  I loved the people who worked there, that was probably the best part.  For the most part, the managers were good people to work with so I didn't have a problem with that.  The store manager got under my skin because he would spend the money we could be getting our bonuses from, in making the price signs seasonal, for example, hunting, baseball, or Razorback signs, people come to Walmart because of low prices, not to look at pretty little signs.  I loved talking to customers, when they weren't slamming Walmart.  The thing that bothered me most about working there was some of the pointless things we did everyday, the zoning of grocery everyday from 2-4pm got to me.  I had things I needed to do in my own sections, all they needed to do was to hire a couple of extra people for the grocery section and they didn't.  Also, we couldn't take breaks or lunches during that time, so I typically had to work 6 hours before getting a lunch break, gross.  When I finally became a department manager, I became a door mat.  If another department manager was gone, I did their job as well, and I set up my modulars alone except for a few.  I did pointless jobs that ANY sales associate could do, yet they wouldn't give me one to work with.  It just became so stressful, I'd dread coming in to work the next day.",3,Former Employee,SALES/DEPARTMENT MANAGER ,Arkansas,1/25/14,2014,1,25

High performance is required to meet expectation for any raise increase.,"Sometimes a typical day requires maximum effort to accomplish assigned tasks. Other days if you finish, you are sent to another department to help someone not able to finish, all dependent on scheduled incoming freight that varies seasonally especially during Christmas season.  Time management is essential to complete expected work duties.  Management often changes so it's difficult to judge their view of your job performance. Co-workers are often helpful when you are new with some exceptions that just let you struggle along.  Hardest part is learning the duties as they often change daily.  Most enjoyable part is satisfaction of doing job well.",3,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Champaign, IL",1/25/14,2014,1,25

fine place to work as long as management likes you,"the coworkers are generally nice and easy to get along with. management tries to help as much as they can. one manager in particular was well known for not liking anyone and giving everyone a hard time. i was required to have a perfect zone(put away reshops, clean trash bins and conveyor belts, pull everything forward on the shelves, etc.) and my coworkers would say that the zone was the best they had seen but the manager would say that i didnt zone. that is just one example. but she was the only bad seed among the rest of the managers.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Herkimer, NY",1/25/14,2014,1,25

Wasn't What i expected,"I was Hired on as a Temporary position in the photo lab, after two days of being on the floor and in my position they had told me about another position in the toys department and that i would be getting 40  hours a week for only two weeks and it had started at 5 a.m. and ended at 2 p.m. I had grown to like that position but hated the hours. I made two friends while working in the toys department and my department head, we really just tolerated each other more than anything. It was a relatively easy job compared to the photo lab. When the two weeks were up I had gone back to the photo lab and was glad to have later hours but not as many (the only down fall). When i would get to work i worked with 4 other girls and occasionally a supervisor if we got really busy. It was an easy position as well but i never got the chance to learn how to put the canvas' together and every time i would  ask there would always be an excuse why i couldn't. I knew how to put the mounted photos together but same excuses. The most enjoyable part of my day would be helping the customers with the kiosks, looking at the photos, and informing them about the cameras. Toward the last week of my employment i was noticing a lot of positions opening but they never got filled. I wouldn't want to work for this Walmart again; all because they had ignorant supervisors.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Sullivan, MO",1/24/14,2014,1,24

Assistant them with our financial department with cashing checks, completing money gram transactions for them, printing money orders, paying bills. I learned a lot from walmart. I learned the skills I have now in order to go somewhere else and put them to use. Management was okay. Only thing I did not like is one manager telling you to do one thing a certain way. When that manager was not around you have another manager telling you to do it differently. My co-works were cool. We had each other back especially when we needed help with something.

Safe and Security,A typical work day at Wal-Mart is hectic but can be fun if you have the right attitude and depending on the sense of humor of your coworkers.

summary of the job and what i think of it.,"a typical day would start out as getting the carts together and then clean the loading docks such as dust moping it and then cleaning it with a machine but it also depends on the day and what they want us to do. Other days I would clean all bathrooms the break room dust mop the produce and also other days I would help stock the shelves it being groceries or toys or car parts or lights or house products. The management is good but there were 5 people who wanted different things done different ways. So it was hard doing everything that all 5 people asked of me to do, and having people above me say im doing it right then someone else would say im doing it wrong behind him, but I was meeting everyone and learning everything and how it should go was the most enjoyable part of the job .",4,Former Employee,Overnight maintenance ,"Clarksville, TN",1/24/14,2014,1,24

Hard physical labor,"I liked the routine and the fact that your shift passes quickly. You don't have time for any clock staring. My co-workers were weird but entertaining.

Walmart Review,"Working at Walmart requires a certain type of person. In my experience of working at walmart, I have encountered countless thieves and disgruntled customers who will insult you directly to your face over something as simple as a pricing issue. In the case that the associate decides to defend themselves, they are terminated rather than management defending their employees or their company. The management is also very disrespectful to their employees as well. There was not anything very enjoyable for me working there.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tacoma, WA",1/22/14,2014,1,22

Management was helpful and willing to teach new things. I absolutely enjoyed my co-workers. As a result of working there, I've built new friendships. The hardest part of the job would be sometimes the amount of freight. It's hard to finish the freight and still make sure your area is zoned by the time you are scheduled to leave.

well walmart is a great place to work but i want to change careers and go back to what i used to do which is taking care of people,A day at the job can be fun at times and at times it can be frustrated.

people of walmart,"The best way to learn to hate the human race, is to work at walmart. Atypical day would start out with a manager asking you to do part of their job for them, then you get to deal with a customer yelling at you for their card getting declined, while simultaneously yelling at their toddler. He's 3, he's supposed to want skittles, chill out. Then when you finally get to start doing YOUR job, another manager will come pull you out of your department to pick up slack in another department. The hardest part of the job was realizing that typically, the customer wasnt necessarily angry with you, but more with them selves . The most enjoyable part of the day was clocking out and goin home. granted, you will always get your hours, and you are able to get benefits through the company, and in certain aspects you can learn alot while working there.",3,Former Employee,TLE Service Technician ,st.robert mo,1/22/14,2014,1,22

the blind leading the blind,"Walmart in itself is full of easy jobs.  But unfortunately the management itself could care less about their employees.

Once the task is done its lunch time. After lunch break is over its time to get the product out to the floor. While my employees are doing that I am monitoring making sure things got out in a timely matter but correct .I'm also following up on task through out the day making sure my employees are keeping up with there task and staying on task. What I learned about this job is that in order to get your job done and make sure my employees get there job done is all about teamwork. It didn't matter if I was there supervisor which my employees knew but there was an understanding with me and employees.Treat all your employees fairly and with respect showing them that you care then they will take care of you by getting there tasks done. My employees/co-workers are a great team to work with and be around. The hardest part of the job was making sure my employees got the truck unloaded in a timely matter because you never know what to expect when your unloading a truck. It can be challenging sometimes.

"Working for Walmart can be challenging and fun, if you are working with the right kind of people.","A typical day at Walmart is never boring. There are always many shoppers in the store, and as a cashier, attending to customers was a constant. I learned to be patient with the general public as well as being patient while I learned company procedures and protocols. Once I became a professional ""Walmart cashier,"" I was able to give customers the level of customer service that they expected when they shopped at Walmart. And of course making friends among your coworkers is always a plus, and it makes the day go faster when you have someone to work with, laugh with, and help you out when you need it.

Its always good to make a connections with customers. But also not to talk to much. The hardest part of the job would have to be standing in one spot for 8hours a day.

Productive and evolving workplace,Everyone receives generally around 3-4 trailers to load throughout a 10 hour shift each day. You take the freight off the line that comes to you and place it in the trailer and build a quality wall from the floor to the ceiling of the trailer. Management tells us about our day in the beginning and walks around to each of us throughout the day making sure we have everything we need. Each co-worker looks out for one another by helping each other on their trailers if they are running slow. The hardest part of the job at the DC is building and maintaining a sturdy wall.

With offering a wide variety of items, the store would attract large groups of customers resulting in constant replenishment and customer service. Management was required to be very hands on in order for each day to be a success. This really improved my time management, delegation, and planning skills tremendously.  Without being extremely flexible and open to change and hard work, success would be very challenging.

I learned more about electronics when learning about information to give customer's accurate information. management that I worked with seemed to be understanding and flexible. the other sales associates that I worked with were open to help with information that I was not aware of and helped me stay on task. the hardest part of the job was learning task with not as much help because of the holiday season.

Understanding the scope of retail management and customer service,"A typical day at work was striving to achieve excellent customer service - no matter what!! _x000D__x000D_What I learned is that while the customer isn't always necessarily right, it's important to validate the concerns of the customer and do whatever it takes to earn their respect and trust. _x000D__x000D_Management was the best! The General Store Manager was quite a bit younger than I was and was very driven, ethical and excited about his role.

For the most part, the co-workers I got to know enjoyed their jobs and believed they brought value to the Store.  _x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job was getting others to be excited about the big picture - the overall goals of the store. And the hours were rough, especially as I was being mentored by the Store Manager to learn all aspects of the store. There is no such thing as 'set hours' in retail. During my employment, I worked a variety of schedules, even overnight.

A day at walmart,I like working for Wal Mart the only thing is when a customer needs assistance they are waiting for a long period of time to have someone come to help them and when a manager is called for help or when a cashier needs help they are waiting for a while and it then cause frustration and upsets the customer when they are on a time spand and want to get out of the store after being there for a long time doing there shopping.

They plotted against each others jobs and never communicated with each other or the people under them and caused a huge chaos that turned the people actually living in the area away to the other Walmart. Hostile working environment due to lack of management. Even corporate didn't try hard to fix the problems. Employees had no real voice until management had no idea what they were doing and barely then. Pay was terrible for the amount of work your doing and they hardly give raises and if so 40cent every year was normal.

It's all about the Mart,"A day working at wal mart is not for the faint at heart. You have a job title/disruption however it will soon feel as if they should have added two or more titles to it. always understaffed, You will never receive a wage suited for the amount of work you do in a giving day. often you'll get that one manager that makes working there enjoyable. i would not try to raise a family with this pay unless both parents are working. With that said Wal mart does have room for climbing the ladder to management. I have heard from some of the manager that I am close to say “it is not that hard of a job, if you want it”. I always say no to it, it’s just not the type of work place for me.",2,Current Employee,Maintenance ,"Mayfield Heights, OH",1/15/14,2014,1,15

It was not a good place to work For,You would come in and get pulled around by 5 different people at one time. I did learn about retail and how it works. I did move up by the highest pay I ever got was $12.40 An hour as a manager to me that was not good when I was there for 6.5 years.

Walmart,a typical day at work is usually unpredictable one never really knew what to expect it was very fast paced and unpredictable. what ive learned is that you get out what you put into your work.

I was involved in the hiring process but had really no say so in who got a job or not, not that that mattered but I saw first hand what goes on at this company.

I loved my job at Walmart!,"A typically day at Wal-mart would be; clocking in, automatically getting started on morning freight off the trucks and stocking these items, items that could not be stocked I binned into the backroom using the telxon. I learned new things everyday because when I finished my tasks I would go ask for more work and work in all different areas of the store. Management was great, they always would come to get me to build end caps, set mods, or anything else that they would ensure the work would be done. One day I asked ""why do you always come and get me to do these things?"" and they responded ""we know if we ask you the job will get done in time a reasonable amount of time and it will be done right."" What I enjoyed most was working in multiple areas and always getting good reports from the managers. My store manager informed me that he was sad to lose me because I was one of his best workers. My co-workers were always friendly as well I always got along with everyone of them. I would say the hardest part of my job would be when I had to lift extremely heavy batteries from tire & lube express into buggies and sent out to TLE to be put in the cage.",5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lebanon, VA",1/14/14,2014,1,14

Never a dull day at work,I started Wal-mart as an overnight cashier. Later I moved on  to being a customer service manager. I enjoyed working with everyone there. I had a LOT of coworkers. Everyone had unique ideas and personalities. I learned patience mostly at this job. There are so many people you deal with on a daily basis that a little patience and tact can go a long way.

Great work place,I loved working at walmart. My typical work day there was cashing the customers out and most of the time it would be very busy but I loved it because I stayed busy. I learned great customer service and how to be fast so I could just get the customer cashed out (because no one likes to shop when its busy) Management was great I made great friendships with them. They were my second family some of them were even my mother at work. My co-workers were great. We all got along great. I have some great memorizes there with my co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was working during the holidays it wasn't because of how busy it was but because of everyone being so stressed out and rude.

"A rich company that is very poorly managed, so they waste money and blame it on the people at bottom.","On a typical day I would come in and make a list of what bikes I need to fill the rack. The bike rack usually has empty slots in it after I've been off  a couple days. I'll be out there making my list and a manager comes up to me and says "" why are there so many holes in this bike rack?"" I  usually tell them that I just got there after being off 2 days and they say ""well that""s just and excuse."" I tell them, we sold some bikes. that's a good thing right? They tell me to ""get it filled or you're fired. What I learned from working there is that everyone is replaceable no matter how much they do. The management there is a joke starting right at the top. They ignore the Global Ethics Policy and None of them know what it means to be a leader. All they know how to do is boss people around. None of them take any responsibility for their own actions. They just blame the workers. I didn't have any problems with any of my co-workers we were all in the same boat together just trying to make it through each day. The hardest part about the job was having to put up with the cruelty of managers who were only interested in their own well being and not the well being of the people they were giving orders to. The most enjoyable part of the job was assembling and fixing bikes for customers and seeing their reaction when they got the finished product.",1,Former Employee,Assembler ,"Gulfport, MS",1/10/14,2014,1,10

Lackluster,"Though advancement may seem rather easy at first, the work load is simply ridiculous and unattainable a majority of the time. I also find management to be very hypocritical and not necessarily always fair though they attempt to project that image to the associates. The company never seems to have enough associates to facilitate all the necessary job duties so management often stretches those that are there quite thin and expect several hours worth of work to be accomplished in an unreal amount of time. The expectations are higher then what is humanly possible and management generally makes the associates feel bad about not being able to complete the deeds requested of them.",2,Current Employee,Overnight Inventory Control Specialist ,"Federal Way, WA",1/9/14,2014,1,9

Consistent fun and challenging workplace,"There is never a typical day at WalMart, everyday is different that's what I loved about working there, a new challenge every day. You never know who is going to come through your line. You can have a customers with 2 or 3 items, then you have customers with 100 items. You have the nice and talkative customers who make your day and keep you in a positive mood, then you have the not so nice customers who just want to complain and not hold any conversation. Anything can happen. Someone could get injured on the job, wether its an associate or a customer, then of course there are procedures you follow in that case. The hardest part would be not being able to help every customer that comes through the line when you really want to but what they are looking for might not be there or something. When I first started working there my co-workers were so helpful in teaching me codes on the register and what I needed to do if there was a problem, or if I stuck and didn't know what to do. Im the type of person who asks a lot of questions when I don't know what to do, and nobody got frustrated with me they helped me through it or told me what i needed to do.

A few of the overnight managers were okay but the overall experience was pretty exhausting and horrible.,"A typical work day, (despite them changing my schedule just about every week without a word to me about it and also a website schedule that isn't even updated sometimes,) would usually consist of me coming into work a half hour early and clocking in 5 minutes early as recommended by the personnel manager and spending 8 hours helping customers find items, retrieving items from cases, wheeling around pallets full of merchandise to stock the shelves and in the case of holiday seasons being told to stock things where they didn't go by my managers. I didn't learn much besides job safety tips, because the actual job was very easy, however the shoddy management and constant overworking and strain made it unbearable for me to keep doing that job. All my co-workers (besides some management) were mostly very lovely people, however they were all much older and had worked there for years so their jobs were not constantly on the line as mine was and they were not worked quite as hard. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management and the overworking I suffered, and the most enjoyable part was when I was FINALLY sent some help after weeks of a massive workload all to myself despite me helping others almost every night.

I learned so much with customer service foods, time management, and food responsibility. Management was disappointing at times with asking of excess amount of tasks at times, not noticing when associates needed help, or even helping them when they did. Hardest part for me was balancing my department with 3 other departments that my Assistant Managers kept wanting me to help with while I was the only one in the own department most of the time. Even when other departments had 3 or 4 associates working at a  time they would pull me from my department even though I was the only one in it.

Management was awesome,This is the only place I've ever worked that the management understands the workers. They all worked their way up and as such they realize realistic boundaries. They expect you to give it your all and as long as you do they will give everything their all as well. Management would actually walk into overworked areas and see that they needed help. They would not only call other associates to assist but weren't afraid to jump in themselves. Once unloaded a freight truck that was sent accidentally by corporate. The store manager came back to the back room jumped into the truck and worked along side me all while we continued rocking out working with the radio on.,4,Former Employee,Backroom Inventory service technician ,"Victor, NY",1/5/14,2014,1,5

Overnight Stocker,"Working overnight shifts at Wal-Mart predicates how your life will be during the day. I lost 20 lbs since I started working there 10 months ago. The physical labor can be overwhelming and the expectations to complete the tasks within a certain time frame is extremely stressful. The worst part of the job wasn't even the labor, it was the management. Not a week went by where one manager in particular would threaten me with job termination.  I know it's their jobs to supervise but getting threats of getting my ""face pounded in"" for not getting 1 of 5 pallets off the floor before 6 a.m. was beyond infuriating. The worst experience was witnessing a manager actually pull out a watch and time an older lady to see how fast she could stock an item on the opposite side of the aisle saying things like, ""and don't run,"" which left the lady in tears once he left. Management is Wal-Marts worst aspect.",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Springfield, MO",1/4/14,2014,1,4

It's almost exactly what you would expect from a business like walmart.,"Walmart is very impersonal in general. Direct managers generally come from within which can be nice and make direct supervisors easy to relate to, but as management goes higher, you can feel the distance forming. The low pay attracts two types of people, people who can live on it and people who are desperate for money. A general day on third shift is usually a fairly busy one of getting blamed for not doing everyone else's work on top of your own. Walmart demands a lot for the low pay._x000D__x000D_I've heard rumors that other walmarts are better than the one I work at.",3,Current Employee,Frozen and Dairy Associate ,"Augusta, KS",1/2/14,2014,1,2

"Its Wal Mart, what do you expect?","My time with this retail juggernaut was rather sour. First off I was hired as a Overnight Maintenance worker making 8.00 an hour, just to receive a cut to minimum wage (7.25) and demoted to Lot Associate for no apparent reason. My time as a lot associate was monotonous, and it just so happened to be during the worst summer in a decade for eastern North Carolina..they were stingy with water and breaktime and management was horrid, so we were ran ragged, like slaves almost.

great opportunity,wal mart is a great place to work with all the changes since sam Walton died the ideas that have come down from the home office are not customer friendly it is more important to have a clean backroom than a full sales floor.  The store Is run with a skeleton crew and being a grocery store it needs to be staffed and kept full otherwise we are doing our customers a disservice.   it is more important to make a score card come in than to do the right thing.  I enjoy working at walmart and I know that I am not the only one that feels that way but it is the direction for now that the company is going.,4,Current Employee,"dept manager dry grocery, candy and liquor ","Yreka, CA",1/1/14,2014,1,1
Holiday Rush,Working at Walmart gave me a sense of pride and importance. Dealing with the public on a daily basis was very rewarding and uplifting. Around the times of the holidays work became quite exciting and I was able to experience a variety of people.. some positive and some negative. The management team at Walmart handled well under pressure and was cheerful to both the public and staff as well which made for a comfortable work environment. The hardest part in working at Walmart was the holiday crowds although this time was exciting. What I enjoyed most about working with Walmart is the feeling I received when my customers walked away satisfied and at ease.,4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Oroville, CA",1/1/14,2014,1,1
Stressful work place,Walmart is too big of a company that they allow people to walk all over others to climb up the ladder of management.

Satisfaction depends on the individual,"The corporate culture requires employees to be very self motivated to find a high level of success within the organization.

Overnight Stocking so much better than day time relaxed and not as many customers,"Nights at Wal-Mart are pretty much all the same as always fun relaxed and not as many customers as the day time so that means we can get more work done. What I've learned about this job is people come to wal-mart overnight for a number of reasons, one clubs or either opening or closing and another is a easier shopping experience getting in and out because theirs not that many people in the store. Management took the jobs to heart sometimes they could be fare and working with us both most of the time unfair and letting their problems getting in the way of their jobs.

I nicknamed the place the Devil's Warehouse,"Everyday you come into work and get ready to unload the truck for the day. Sometimes there were more than one. The day crew is supposed to help set up for the truck so you can jump right on in. At the Wal-Mart I was in they don't. So, we spent the first hour of our shift collecting pallets for the general merchandise, and carts to put the grocery merchandise in. It wouldn't take so long if management would respond when needed._x000D_An hour into the shift and we are still expected to get the truck done as if we had started on time. Fortunately, we were able to get the truck done on time still on most nights. Other nights we weren't so lucky. When we couldn't even listen to music time dragged, and every minute felt like an eternity._x000D_After the truck was done we would take the pallets out to the floor. Afterwhich we would either do inventory in the backroom, or help stock shelves. Management was easily the worst part of this job. They belittled you, and never answered when you asked for them. Trying to get an answer from them was harder than prying a tooth out of a screaming child. And they contradicted each other from one person to the next on what needed to be done. Because of this, this was easily the hardest part of the job._x000D_The most enjoyable part was being satisfied once the truck was unloaded. Seeing the empty 52' long trailer and knowing you did that was a great feeling. Plus, you never had to go to the gym, either.",3,Former Employee,Unloader/Inventory Control Specialist ,"American Fork, UT",12/30/13,2013,12,30

I have noticed in the beginning when you first started out everybody was very willing to work with each other but as time passed I notice that it was just a show for the new people. The management at Walmart has no respect for their staff and with the understanding that certain things need to be done and certain budgets have to be Not showing the employees a little care will always cause them to have a high employee turnover rate.,1,Former Employee,Deli Associate / stock ,"Hazard, KY",12/29/13,2013,12,29

When it was time for me to leave to go to school I put in a transfer request to a different store closer to the school I was going to. I put the request in months before leaving and a week before I left my information was just getting transfered to the store, by then there were no positions open. I had to leave the store I was at due to not having my request approved, when I tried to come back to the store, I was given the runaround by the managers there, even though I haven't had any disciplinary issues or write-ups the year and a half I was at the store.

To be honest, the management was not all that great this year which led my co-workers and I having to negotiate times to take our lunch or go on breaks.

Management only cares about their yearly bonus and how they look to the store manager and corporate. There is no respect for the individual from management. Management does not care if you are unhappy with a schedule or equipment not working properly, they do not care if you work your tail end off so that they do not get any sort of rep remand from the store manager. Most managers do not care about customers and act as if they are the most important person in the store.

Wal-Mart could use improvement,"While working at Wal-Mart I have always performed at a highly efficient manner. I always greeted customers and associates along with doing my regular duties. I often found myself overworked because I did my job along with covering for others more than once. I've felt that I was being taken advantage of by the requests asked of me. I've gained multiple experiences which I do not think I can use for other jobs that I am interested in. A typical day at work required cleaning the floors, spills, bathrooms, and other areas. I've also took out trash and threw away garbage or any other materials. I've learned that Wal-Mart's management can be abusive unintentionally and inconsiderate. Many of the coworkers were lazy, inconsiderate, and opportunists. Many of the coworkers who were supposed to help the customers did little to nothing to assist the customers. Various employees would make a mess and expect maintenance to clean it up. The hardest part of the job was performing all duties that were my job description along with whatever the managers random requests.

"Not the worst job in the world, but lacks realism","I've become a bit jaded about the world of sales and marketing, so my feelings about the most popular retailer in the world are certainly biased. Working at this company would not be unpleasant if they would hire enough people for the workload they carry, but then I suppose that's most companies these days. I did enjoy the challenge of having responsibility over several small departments, and having at least some amount of control over how they were run, but the vast majority of direction at the store level came straight down from the regional leadership, so it was very demotivating to be held responsible for something over which you had so little control. It was difficult for me to find inspiration to do well in a job that revolves completely around the distribution of almost entirely unnecessary commercial goods (hence the use of the phrase ""lacks realism"" in my review summary). Overall, I have learned a great deal about how a business is run, and how I choose to use that information, for better or worse, is up to me.",2,Current Employee,Merchandise Supervisor ,"Portland, OR",12/25/13,2013,12,25

The management was good for the most part but their operating procedures need a lot of improving when it comes to freight._x000D_working for walmart can be a fun place to work at but for how big a corporation and how much many it brings in it doesn't make sense why the employers can't get payed better, walmart makes way more enough money to pay it's employees very well and to have them all as full time.",1,Current Employee,Over the Road Driver ,"Westminster, CO",12/25/13,2013,12,25

Seasonal gone bad.,"I was a seasonal cashier I don't know if it is just the Walmart I was at or all are like this but this one was a horrible employer to me. In another words if I ever go to hell I expect to wake up in a 24 hour Walmart kind of thing.  I don't know where to start but first I will start with the erratic schedule it's evening, nights one day early morning the next. I wasn't given at least seven breaks while I was there, it was always a mystery if I would get one or a lunch. I would often call for a manager for change while cashiering(for my drawer) and they would never come. In fact, at Walmart, if you need a manager for anything they will not come and you are left there with the customer to explain why. (you after a while will throw the management under the bus because realistically it's not your fault). You are never told anything, in fact it is your job to chase management down to figure out your schedule or to make changes to it even though it was someone else in Management who told you to work a certain shift. What ever happened to, if someone wanted you to work, scheduling for it? Also the store I worked at was a mess, things were always out of place, left thrown around and it seemed one out of four customers items were wrong up wrong. Oh and as a last present from this store, I guess as a Christmas present, they didn't bother to tell me when my last day was, they simply stopped scheduling me. Even though I worked every weekend for Walmart while I was there and even dressed up like Santa, far beyond my job description, Oh and didn't miss a single day.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Santee,Ca",12/24/13,2013,12,24

About working environment,"A typical day at work: Clock in, go to my department, be productive through out the day, and than clock out.

Find another job and when you are ready put your notice in. _x000D_Management: Sometimes the management need to be questioned about their ethics and motives, personal as well as professional. There is only one manager that has a problem with his ethics and it could cost him._x000D_Co-workers: I have to give kudos to some of my co-workers for sticking it out as long as they have.

All management does is do what's told to them from corporate, unquestionably.No one, regional managers, store managers, assistant managers ever think for themselves and maybe say, ""wait a minute, there is a better way"", if they did it would go nowhere and probably put them on a list as a troublemaker._x000D_ In my opinion, Walmart is probably one or the main reasons that our country is in the financial crisis it is in.

"Good to the consumer, nearly abusive to the employee.","Wal-Mart Inc. is a fantastic retailer, however, they are less than kind to their employee's. When they claim ""flexible hours"" they actually mean ""we will schedule you at random, and for whatever hours we see fit"". Benefits are supposed to come into effect as of 180 days employed within the company, however they will most likely either let you go, under the pretense of ""down-sizing"" a location just before you make it to 180 days, or they will keep you on and refuse to issue benefits citing ""paperwork problems"". If you have a problem with a member of management or a supervisor, whether personal or professional, it is best to just accept that they are allowed to do as they see fit, as using the ""open-door policy"" will undoubtedly lead to the subsequent termination of your employment.

"Poor lack of management. There are some well respected people there but more slackers than anything, that includes the management.","I have only been there a month and a half and I have to bear witness to the disfunction that runs rampant at Walmart. The managers placed there are obviously chosen from favoritism and the language that is allowed is down right disgraceful for a company that prides themselves for customer service. I am ashamed to work in the back and see the lack of responsibility day in and day out. Worst of all I have a pregnant wife in her second trimester and none of the managers or customers for that matter could care less that she is pregnant. One customer tried to swing at my wife, and when it was brought up to a manager they replied by saying that is an everyday thing.

Good for college kids and wives who just want a job to get out of the house.  Managers are mostly do-nothing observers who you usually have to hunt down if you want to talk to them.

Poor management,Walmart has too many managers to employees. This leads to a lot of confusion with too many people telling you what to do without talking to each other.

I was not satisfied with the way management was carried out and uncleanliness of employees.,"I learned that working for Walmart was a big mistake for me. Out of all the years that I worked in retail and as a Cashier, their management team was viewed as a joke to me because they let the store get so far behind in areas of stocking departments and cleaning  in certain departments. Maybe things are different now as it has been two years since I worked there. But, many female workers in the back stock warehouse would not button a single button on their shirts to attract male employees. The conversation in the air was despicable! Unfair treatment was witnessed by myself and other co-workers from supervisors toward co-workers. Their use of words to get things done for them were as if they were talking to a child of theirs. _x000D_I saw favor shown to lazy workers who talk back and disrespect managers and were not disciplined. Instead, they got their way when they didn't want to work a particular department. I would always get called overhead from department to department from my register because of weak management. I am not a complainer and got used._x000D_Managers clicked and hung out with employees in the break room and rudely engaged in female bashing, and engaged in bad conversations.

fast pace environment with plenty of change,Work can be challenging at times. Especially when juggling responsibilities such as customer service and your daily task but it all makes the day go by faster in the end. Working for Walmart taught me how to be responsible and on time. It only took one person to call out to completely turn your day into chaos. Management are friendly and try to deal with everyone's concerns in a timely manor. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant change. Nothing stays the same for too long in retail. What you move today might get moved several more times before the end of the week but its all part of the job. I think the most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with people. Some can get under your skin but most are just happy that some one took the time to stop and help them out.

"Had respect for other employees, work as a team and respected them as a person","I worked over nights, so my job started at 10pm. Sign in for a telson and printer. My job was to pick merchandise from the bins from 10pm to 3am out of bins, freezers and coolers. I always help customers on the floor and managers also had me doing other things at the same time doing my picks which is over 800 picks per night. I also help and manage the 4pm to 1am backroom team organize and set up back room with all the over stock freight on the general merchandise side. I took the pallets down with the electric pallet jack. After I finish my side of picks, I would go on the Grocery side to help finish their picks. After lunch, we had over 100 overstock pallets we had to put back in the backroom on General merchandise side of the store and bin what we could into the bins and I would go on Grocery side and bin it all up before we could go home which most of the time it was after 9am.  What I learn is you have to respect others as human beings not a machine. Management needs to appreciate their employees for the hard and demanding work they do and we do our best! They need to help us at times when the demand is so much and quit calling employees in the office on production, when everyone is working as fast and hard as we can. My co workers was the best, we support each other at work and bad times! The hardest part of my job is I am a hard worker, fast pace and team player.

It really depends on the store manager, but most of them will push the envelope on over-working their management team in the name of ""executing the business."" The starting salary may look appealing, but when you divide out how many hours you work, you may be disappointed in how much you are actually making per hour. _x000D__x000D_Associate morale is at an all-time low. The focus has shifted even more away from properly staffing and training actual employees, and more towards using outside temp agencies when things get really off-track. Aside from a lack of focus on hiring and proper training, starting wages are so low that people cannot afford to live and work with just that one job. This leads to a workforce that is fatigued and unmotivated. If a sales associate is lucky to get promoted to a ""department manager"" they automatically assume a larger load of responsibility for a whopping 40 cent pay raise. The next level is a Zone merchandise supervisor (ZMS) which comes with a $2 pay raise which may sound reasonable, but keep in mind that with a base pay rate of around $8, a relatively new ZMS is only going to be making around $10.50 an hour in a metro store._x000D__x000D_To make matters worse, we do not even hire full-time hourly workers anymore unless its a really rare occasion. Instead we hire people in as ""temporary"" for up to 6 months and then we may offer them a ""part-time"" position.

Would not recommend,"Although I enjoyed working with other coworkers I found the time schedule very difficult to work with. In this position days and shift hours are never the same. This makes it very difficult to find a second job in order to supplement your lack of income. Walmart claims it has an ""open door"" policy that allows you to connect directly to the store manager. Unfortunately your concerns go unaddressed. Managers smoking while on the clock close to less than 5 foot from the building is more than common. The bale compactor that is extremely necessary is seldom available for use. Back doors to dumpster is kept locked with only management possessing a key. When Managers do not come to let the other employee out for 15-30 minutes in order for the employee to discard their expired products it takes a lot of time off the employees time to preform other tasks.",1,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Greenville, MI",12/11/13,2013,12,11

My co-workers and I have become very close over the 5 plus years I have been working with this company. In my opinion, I work with some of the sweetest people I have ever met. The hardest part of my job would be working with the customers who are not completely satisfied. I try my best to ensure everyone has a great experience when coming through the door until they leave, so to see someone upset or not completely satisfied does not settle well with me.

Productive,"a typical day at work for walmart consisted of zoning,cashiering if need be, stocking the backroom or salesfloor, unloading the truck, dealing with different managers some reasonable some unreasonable, cleaning up spills and documenting counts of inventory on floor and in the backroom. I learned from walmart more patient due to the more vigorous atmosphere of customers whom visit walmart and are angered with their service or the inconvenience of an item no being in the store. I also grasped more management qualities and skills from working side by side with dept managers, assistance managers, and zoning manager. I also developed more customer service skills that what i had grasped from previous employers. My management was pretty solid. they all had different work ethics, some worked some didn't. I was blessed with the opportunity to have the majority of working managers ahead of me and guiding me. My co-workers again some worked and some didn't.

The store was cliquish, and anyone who resented that attitude was an outcast (I was one of them, and we stuck together).  The management was very by the book, but unfortunately the book was written by higher ups who didn't even know there was any such thing as the working class.  The closer a store adhered to corporate policy, the higher their turnover rate tended to be.  People who didn't quit were often fired under false pretenses and petty disputes, and they had little to no chance for rebuttal.  Those who wished to stay with the company for the sake of simply being employed avoided being let go by frequently changing departments.

They cannot function properly without the associates and there teamwork, you fellow co-workers have to be your teammates and communication is key.

A Day in the Pharmacy,"A typical day at work would consist of arriving before pharmacy hours, receiving deliveries, and preparing pharmacy for opening. Once  the pharmacy was open my job consisted of processing electronic scripts, faxed scripts, and hard copies from patients at the drop off window. I would receive the prescriptions and type them up, through a system called Connexus, and then they would be sent to the pharmacist computer for double-checking, I completed this task very efficiently with near 100% accuracy on a daily basis (mainly the reason why I was the one employee always placed at the drop pff window). When the que for that was cleared and there wasn't many customers I would go to the filling station and fill as many prescriptions as I could by scanning the tote, medication, then printer for the label. After counting out the pills I placed all totes in order for the pharmacist to check. At the pharmacy I also had other responsibilities that other employees weren't able to do, like the GENCO returns (shipping back expired drugs), all invoices, special ordering, keeping stock of all medications and ordering what I knew was needed for certain patients, maintaining the prescription retention room, extensive work billing insurance companies, and calling DR's offices for clarification of prescriptions, drug interactions, and anything else needed in order to safely and properly fill the prescription.

With little complaint about my work environment, I'd be treated by some of management as if it were my first day on the job, even after working there for several weeks.

Fast paced work place with family minded team building,"Wal-Mart as a company is wonderful. They have excellent focus on community and they are sensitive to their associates needs to balance work and family. In a normal working day I would preform the regular task of cashiering and what they referred to as ""zoning"" which was simply to keep the area around my assigned register clean, neat and the merchandise easily accessible. When I was transferred to the Customer Service desk a normal day included returning ,restocking , and organizing merchandise, answering phones, solving customer concerns, processing paperwork,  normal sales and money wiring. My co-workers were always a blast to work with and made every day fun to work through, even when we delt with difficult customers.

I really like the open door policy with management, it makes talking with management much easier knowing they are there to help the employees. I have found the co-workers to be very helpful and friendly to work with. The hardest part of the job is learning where everything goes on the shelves and all the different departments. I enjoy the family atmosphere that everyone shares with each other while working there. The Walmart company does many family oriented things for the employees for the holidays such as making sure that those who are working are still able to enjoy a holiday meal that is set up for them in the employee lounge by the management of the store since it is open 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

I do however like the job, its fairly easy. I am a quick learner. And enjoy working. This is a hands on job, and very physical.Your always moving. Got to be quick on your feet.

The majority of the associates here are not happy with how things have been handled over the last 2 1/2 or so years and many 5-10+ year associates have changed careers.

Horrible Management Team,I worked for Walmart for 3 years at 2 different stores. It can be a fun place to work but management team overrides that. They are horrible. They do not care for their employees at all. They could careless if you have children and need a day to care for them ( like doc appts and such). Management will delegate all their work to others so they don't have to do anything on top of all your daily routines. Then look to you when something doesn't get done. They will lie to your face and tell you yeah they want you in management or yeah they want to  promote you and then you turn your back and they are doing the exact opposite. I have several friends that are in this work place that are seeking to get out of this horrible place. I do not think that this is ever a place I would want to go back to. Its a trap. Once they have a target on you they do everything they can to get you out of there. I can actually say that I HATE that place!!!!,1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Marietta, GA",12/5/13,2013,12,5
A learning experiment,I learn things every day.I think my typical day would be me walking in Walmart looking at where the meat is seeing what is missing and going in the frigerator or freezer to see if it is in stock and then find out what else is needed of me to do.The hardest part of the job would be when a manager takes me to another department to do other people's work and I don't have time to do what is needed of me in my department.The enjoyable part is just seeing the customers smile when they get what they want .,3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,Dillon S.C.,12/5/13,2013,12,5

I check my palm-pilot to make sure my associates are caught up on their breaks/meals. Then, I immediately begin assisting customers with their needs. My co-workers for the most part are nice,but we're aren't always on the same page due to being told different things by management. Management doesn't really interact with customers unless a customer asks for them or has a complaint.

Typical Retail Work Environment,Management does not seem to care about the individual workers.  If you aren't good at playing company politics you will not advance within the company.

Enjoyable work experience,"I worked in the electronics department for Walmart. I would help the store achieve sales goals and supply excellent customer service. Each day I went to work we started by having a store meeting to catch the entire team up on daily sales, targets, goals, and responsibilities. Once the meeting finished we would all go to our designated area's. My position included helping customers troubleshoot problems with electrical equipment, or compatibility of various technology equipment from accessories to computers and televisions. The job experience was highly enriching as I got to migrate other departments, not just my own. When I went to overnights I was limited on my experience but was still fun because management left me to my own devices and tools to complete my responsibilities. Co-workers were friendly and we all worked as a team. The most difficult part of working for Walmart, in my opinion, would be the terminology of technology. Customers with little to no experience with technology often don't understand the terminology for technology. This can make solving the problem difficult for some customers. At the same time this is also the most enjoyable part of the job because it's a learning experience. The customers who don't understand ask questions. I can learn better ways to explain products, and I can learn how different customers might relate to the experience.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Electronics Associate ,"Poulsbo, WA",12/3/13,2013,12,3

Very good people on staff.,"*Wal-Mart is a busy, bustling place so there's always work to be done. I liked that aspect of it. _x000D__x000D_*The most enjoyable part of the job are the people; customers and employees. There will always be the occasional disgruntle and unnecessarily rude customer but that's not the case most of the time._x000D__x000D_*I've learned much in my 2+ years at Wal-Mart. If you decide to work there, you should not plan to remain in the position you're hired in for more than 6 months. This is beneficial for 2 reasons: 1.) By taking on different positions in the store you begino t learn how to do different things. Backroom operations, customer relations and store routines are just of few of the things I picked up in my first few months at Wal-Mart. The quicker you learn the better your chances are of being considered for promotions before others are.  2.) The 2nd reason it's good to move around as much as possible is because your managers will see the possibility of you being promoted as more of a gain and less of a loss. If you remain in the same position for more than a year, your managers will NOT want to promote you because losing you would hurt their departments' productivity. At that point you're stuck. _x000D__x000D_*At Wal-Mart, it's ALWAYS a good idea to speak up for what you need. If there's something you need to do your job more effectively, ask for it! Don't be afraid to speak to your managers about the issues concerning your position. Sometimes, managers are REALLY busy and don't have the time to notice every little thing or they flat out don't care. It's sad but it's true. Your managers will respect - more...",3,Former Employee,Electronics Rep./2nd Shift Inventory Supervisor ,"Covington, GA",11/27/13,2013,11,27

11 1/2 years at Walmart,"I've been employed at Walmart for 11 1/2 years.  I've learned some great skills that I will be able to carry with me to any other career I go to.  I have learned time management skills, organizational skill, and problem solving skills.  I have also been able to become an independent worker.  The hardest part of my job has been overcoming the ""politics"" and being able to provide the customer with what they need/want.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing happy customers when they came in for particular items and were able to leave the store satisfied with their purchases and seeing the sales for my particular departments increase each week.  Management seems to have changed a lot.  In the beginning, I felt we had some top notch managers who had great retail skills, now I feel as though the hourly associates are more knowledgeable than the managers.  My co-workers for the most part are some of the hardest working people.  We are all in the same struggle to get ahead in life.

"Looking for a career, not just a job.","Working at a retail pharmacy has it's ups and downs. For the most part, the day stays busy/steady. But unfortuantely there is not much advancement. I enjoy the team I work with and my direct management is awesome. Because it is retail, I directly work with my patients face to face. I feel like it is my time to move onto a hospital setting because I would like to make this job choice my career and take it to a professional level. There are days where some of my customers are inpatient and rude, and because I am ultimately there to serve them, I have no choice but to be professional. But I also feel I don't deserve the verbal harassment I sometimes get. One of the perks I have at my job is making as many costumers as I can feel happy and satisfied. Yes, I do have some regulars who know me by name, and look forward to seeing me when they visit the pharmacy once a month. Those are the people who make my job worth while and help me forget how rude some people can be. Not just rude, but getting older and having to be on maintenance medication can be stressful to some, and I always want the customer to feel that I care for them, and show them as much empathy as possible, but some people are just not nice.

I initially started working at Wal-Mart and enjoying myself but it seemed that every other month there was a new manager because the previous one had gotten fired so it was hard to keep up with everything and all of the adjustments. I worked there for almost 3 years and the one time that I needed to take a leave of absence to finish out my final year of volleyball and enter the nursing school; I was denied the right to take a leave of absence. I even followed the procedures of writing a letter to headquarters and pleading with them. They denied my request without consideration of my loyalty to the company.

Wal-Mart also underpays most of its employees, does not reward learning new tasks or skills, and offers a maximum of $0.40 raise each year.

Good in-between job,"Walmart is pretty notorious for their low wages, low hours, heavy exploitation of seniors and recent immigrant workers, and many other things.  However, if you just need somewhere to earn some extra money, especially as a student, then Walmart is not a bad place.  Since they have low hours their pretty flexible with their schedules. If you plan to move up in the company then be careful; the bottom line is pretty much all they care about.  You will usually see the wrong people being promoted and its usually do to office politics.  It makes good working people not want to excel.  Walmart has a lot of power and influence but they don't take care of their own so it crumbles from within, and its the mangers jobs to constantly keep patching it up with new workers instead of taking care of the ones that are already there.",2,Former Employee,Store Associate ,"Edison, NJ",11/22/13,2013,11,22
