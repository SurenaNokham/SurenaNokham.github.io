If you can keep a level head.,"It can get stressful, but as long as you keep your head and breathe you can make this place a great career starting point for yourself. The most stressful part in my opinion are different managers telling you to do different things and having to explain that to them in order to get the different tasks prioritized.",4,Former Employee,Receiver/Stocker and Overnight Maintenance/Stocker ,"Longview, TX",9/25/19,2019,9,25

Uncomplicated Job with Compassionate People,"Work at Walmart starts in the break room, with a breakdown of our positions for the night. The job of running the freight is not too terribly difficult, so we switch positions and areas around the store. As long as you know the basics, every area is easy. The main trick is just to match the barcode with the price tags. We go to our areas and stock the shelves with what has already been brought out by CAP 2. We just go through one box at a time. Most of the time, we'll try to down stack the pallets for each aisle, just to make the work simpler. We run freight until 1:30 am, where we go outside for a half hour to clear the lot and bring all of the carts in. Once we come back, we keep running our freight until 5. We stop at 5 and begin zoning, which is where we pull all of the stocked goods toward the front of the shelves so everything looks nice and full. Management is really kind here; they know everyone by name and want to make sure that everyone is accommodated. I really enjoy the people I work with, and we all laugh and joke. The job culture itself is fairly fast paced, but the work is easy and quick to pick up on, so the fast pace makes the night go fast.",3,Current Employee,OVERNIGHT STOCKER ,"8300 E 96th St, Fishers, IN 46037",9/25/19,2019,9,25

Its Difficult,"I absolutely loved being an associate at walmart. The pay was good. The atmosphere, while I worked there was tense. I didn't really receive benefits.

I loved this job,"Working nights was difficult at first but became easier when used to the schedule. I learned how to use equipment like a pallet jack and a cardboard compactor.

Overall Great!,"This job is fantastic if you keep busy and stay on task. The managers are  flexible and the associates are nice enough. The pay is really good and the hours are decent. _x000D_One thing to keep in mind is the busy and slow season. You might get 6 hour days for a few months then 12 hour days the next few months with some 8-10 hour days in between. Usually it balances out. During slow season you can get Temporary Layoff Time which is awesome. We also had Voluntary Time Off during the slow season. Requesting days off was easy enough. _x000D_During  busy season you get overtime(it's mandatory but if you're like me, that's not a problem) I only left the job because of my commute and the slow season lasted a bit to long the last year i was there.

Good company but the pharmacy is very stressful,"The company itself is a pretty good company to work for offering great benefits, flexible hours, and employee parties.

It was good pay working the graveyard shift until they put two wage garnishments on my paycheck,"Working the graveyard shift and neighborhood dogs that continually bark all day and all night long not allowing me to get the necessary rest I need are counterproductive and make for very difficult circumstances making the job more difficult then it really needs to be. Then there is the fact that as many times as I asked them to leave me with the necessary equipment for me to be able to do my job as I needed they would not try and help me out there, I felt like they did not want me to do my job as I thought I was expected to do. They trained me to do the job the wrong way, literally,  and was not what I had learned on the CBL's that was provided for my on the job training respectively. According to what I learned with my Computer based learning that they provided and the job handbook and specific job requirements per corporate policy as it was to my understanding their expectations of me did not comply with current corporate policy. I got the feeling they did not want me to do my job as I had perceived my job to be. I wanted to do more and continually wanted to do something all the time and it was to my understanding they just wanted me to stand there all the time twiddling my thumbs. Due to their restructuring and store changing and updating store features they eliminated that night shift I was working and those particular jobs I was assigned to at the time,...",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Scottsbluff, NE",9/25/19,2019,9,25

"Overworked, Underpaid, and Stressed","This is going to be a long story, so I'll add a summary at the end of it all. Please bear with me._x000D__x000D_I worked in the electronics section until management hired someone new, and then moved me to fabric and crafts, which was always a mess. I was expected to clean everything up, often by myself. It doesn't sound so bad, but when there's glitter, glue, paint, and raw foods everywhere (left by customers who couldn't be bothered to take it back to the grocery side of the store), cleanup becomes a hassle, and puts you behind schedule, since you have to take everything to its section in the store for proper disposal, and your area has to be spotless by the time your shift was over. _x000D__x000D_While in fabrics and crafts, I was to cut fabric at the table (which didn't have a support mat for employees), keep the area clean( this included dusting and wiping things down), take back returns and place them where they belong, assist customers with whatever they needed, and make sure everything was in tip top shape._x000D__x000D_In electronics, I pretty much did the same thing as fabrics and crafts, sans fabric cutting. I also did tech support, and helped with the photo lab, assisting customers with the kiosks and filling orders. However, I also had the responsibility of holding on to the keys that open the game cases._x000D__x000D_My hours were never set, but usually went like this: today: 1 p.m. to 10 p.m. tomorrow 7.am to 4 p.m, day after 1 to 10 This when on almost every week, so I worked practically 39 and a half hours weekly, but it wasn't considered full time, so I was getting burnout really quick.

Would most definitley work here again.,"The hours are great if you want them to be, meaning picking up shifts was never hard you just had to do it and ask. The pay was well worth the job and as my first one it was exciting to work for $9/hr. It was even more thrilling to know that we would receive raises to $11/hr. The managers all have a different way of doing things, so I would say the hardest part of the job is learning how they would like certain task done. The point system isn't hard to follow but it was inevitably my downfall because I out others jibs before mine.

I learned more about technology and communication skills while working in one of the largest retail store.

Standard Retail environment,"The pay is decently high for Cashiers/Cartpushers at ~$11.25 /hr. That pay ranges between job descriptions. They have a diverse community of Associates throughout all the Departments. All of them work very hard to accomplish their tasks for their respective Departments.

Often times, the interpersonal interactions can become toxic and/or adversarial, if Associates allow them to be so. This will ultimately hamper Productivity, and stifle each individuals energy as they engage with their work place.

Management is awful,"I worked at Walmart on Hwy 29 for about 6 months. The management is what’s wrong with the store. Also there are WAY too many managers, and 90% of them don’t do their jobs. Management promotes the people who are friends with them, not necessarily the people that actually deserve to be promoted. Favoritism is ridiculous there. I worked at the fitting room and in apparel, but you are always pulled to do other people’s jobs like cashiering. If they would actually give the cashiers hours, they could avoid that problem. Management also will lie right to your face about everything, even small, unimportant things. They do offer some benefits, but they aren’t very good. Employees get a discount of 20%, but when I worked there, you couldn’t use it on groceries. The training is decent on the first couple of days. If you still have training videos left to watch, good luck trying to get off of the sales floor to complete them since the department managers usually won’t let you. And if you don’t do them, you can potentially get fired. The hours are pretty great in the beginning, but once you get past the 90 day mark, they start cutting hours. Right before I left I was getting 15-20 hours a week as opposed to the 35-40 hours a week that I was getting at the start. The turnover rate is pretty high, also.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pensacola, FL",9/24/19,2019,9,24

My days would start by meeting up with my other management peers seeing where at in the team schedules pertaining to who had their breaks and lunches and who needed them next within the hour and coming up. Management whenever I needed them depending on the shift always took a while to come up front and when they did come up they did not always listen to what I would tell them, I would tell the customer no we cannot do that or we can do this instead because of our policies and then customer would ask for an assistant manager. I would call a manager up to the front, my managers would take over 20 minutes sometimes longer to come up front for the customer and then would not listen to what the situation is and would ask the customer. The customer sometimes would switch my words and say i refused to help them when in reality in our policies we would not be allowed to do something and then the manager would just give it to the customer because they don't want to deal with an upset customer.

I understand that they must be stressed, and I totally understand their side of being a manager but they don't even try anymore. This is specifically at OGP management. As for the rest of this Walmart's management, I feel bad about them because OGP lacks employee's during the school year and they must come in and spend their time picking groceries for the day when they are supposed to be dealing with their own department.

In Ohio, I was hired as a cart pusher, called an associate,which was managed by the front end department. As I took one of my breaks I checked my blood sugar, it was 63, I was feeling a little low. I went to the vending machine to get some peanut M&Ms and I was followed by the grocery manager as I sat down on the ground he came up to me, asked what I was doing, told him I was taking break and he told me to get up and go back to work.

A company that has become lost,The pay is quite low for the amount of work they expect of you. Most managers have little to no idea what should be going on and when it's brought to their attention then you get yelled at instead of them helping fix the problem. If you do happen to find a good manager at that place I suggest staying on their good side and moving into their department. Opportunity for growth is laughable at times and other times given to the wrong people. On rare occasion is someone right promoted. Customers mostly treat you like you have no idea what you are talking about even though I have a fairly high IQ they still treated me like i was benieth them and just simply scum which made the job's pay even less worth it._x000D__x000D_There is so much more but i'd rather not relive it even mentally.,3,Former Employee,Automotive Service Technician/Service Writer/Cap 2 ,"Chesterfield, MI",9/23/19,2019,9,23

Walmart,A day at Walmart was actually decent . When you clock in you get right to it . Walk around and grab the items that popped up in my scanner and I would place them in my carts. Take them to the time slots and the person would come pick up their groceries. The management was okay except my manager liked to put information out about people in front of customers and coworkers.

The hours you work are insane and your not compensated for the amount of hours you work. It is so much favoritism and retaliation if you do have a complaint.

Ironic they talk all the time about setting you up for success  but  in the end they set up you up for failure due to poor planning  and bad communication  even with each other.  There's either never enough freight  on the dock to load to get your numbers or no trailer to load on . You are supposed to get downtime when this happens but it rarely happens  sl o you get held accountable anyway for thing like this that are not your fault. occurrences come fast  and before you know it you are on a,step  which there are four leading up to termination  it becomes a slippery slope hard to get off of especially if you are trying to save you job .very demoralizing  so please think twice about working here you will regret it.

Wonderful CSM's and helpful coworkers,"I was a new cashier first day on the job in November of 2018. The CSM's (customer service managers) are very friendly and help you with any questions without getting frustrated or stressed. They helped me learn very quickly what a PLU was and how to type it into the cash register, as well as; how the touch screen worked, how to greet customers, money handling, and keeping my work space neat and tidy. I would say the workplace culture was spectacular, it was wonderful to have my team members and CSM's helping me understand the register and i was quickly able to learn how to manage and handle the register on my own. I would say the hardest part of the job would be doing Go- backs. Essentially collecting things that customers misplace and then finding out where the items belong to.It was difficult for me as the new employee and I did not know the stores layout very well. Luckily, i had my team members to help me out. The most enjoyable part of the job i would say was the customer interactions.

Great for a starter job leave as soon as you have fhe time or experience.,This job has great benefits but i would never say stay at this job unless you are in a position to deal with customer abuse 24/7.

A good place to work with good benifits for fulltime employees. And they do have alot of employee appreciation days and feed you good.,"The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers. It was so good to see the customer when they picked up their new glasses and see them so happy. To know they bought good quality product and could see good and look good too. I learned to listen to my customer's to find out their daily needs to help them choose the correct frame and lens for their new glasses. The workplace in the optical center is more like a team all of us working together. No, I think we were more like a family. A typical day at work in the vision center is you hit the ground running. All ways work to be done but always the customers came first. The hardest part of my job was when I had to leave. Did not want to quit. Had to for family reasons and have regretted it everyday since.

"Fun, down to earth co workers, out of touch upper management","I loved the people I worked along side at all levels I've worked at Walmart. I learned a lot about people, myself, and life in general. However I believe Walmart has an issue with management above store level. They seem to be out of touch with the reality of people needing to maintain a work life balance. Walmart does a great job of ""teaching"" management to take peoples personal lives into account, however it is not implemented in practice. The needs of the store/company often trump personal needs. Creating an environment where you're overworked, exhausted and losing yourself. This is MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I have no issues with the company as a whole, it's a good company to work for honestly. I just think they have some kinks in the hose of their management and it's hurting the stores and overworking their field management.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Middletown, DE",9/21/19,2019,9,21

"Great coworkers, until you get to upper management.","I enjoy almost every coworker, but upper management is absolutely terrible.

Not worth it,"I didn't find out until almost my fifth year at my store that I was not getting the fulfillment of title, benefits, and advancement opportunities.

Very stressful,Wal-Mart is a very inspiring place to work for. Only if the management is on the same page.

Productive Place to Work and Advance,A typical day at work was unloading the truck when it comes with the plants. We had to help the guy place them in the proper place and then price them and water the plants. What I learned for my manager is how to do price changing in the computer and the name of the different plants. The hardest thing was watching the gate so the people who were stealing would not run our the gate with stuff.

The worse place to work.,"This would be a ideal job for a kid just getting out of high school that needs money fast. Other then that it is not a place to look for a career. The managers talk down, make fun, and call the associates names to their faces, They will pick favorites, treat their favorites great, but when it comes to someone just doing their job and not kissing butt they will treat worse then dirt. They do not care about personal things in your life, like having a emergency (you will get wrote up for) you will get in trouble and possibly fired for getting hurt even if it was a accident. the general manager aka the big big boss will treat you like you are nothing unless you work in his favorite area which is pfc on days. other then that he wont like you. The ops managers will treat you worse then the regular managers. but all in all this is the worst place to look for a career. unless you need fast cash.",1,Current Employee,Break Pack Associate ,"Grantsville, UT",9/20/19,2019,9,20

"Busy and Constantly Suspected by Lying, Manipulative Management","The management are liars and manipulators who attempt to trick you into doing things instead of being honest and persuading. I liked my co-workers but the management were always lying and pressuring. The customers were the worst I ever encountered in my life and they always took the strategy of trying to con us into doing things that would cost us our jobs and then reporting us to the management when we refused. Of course, what they tell the management is often not what they requested of us. The management knows this but puts on a show to please the customer by degrading us in front of them. If a customer harasses or even assaults us, the management usually just gives us extra break time until the customer leaves. I've watched managers put defective or shorted items that have been returned to the store right back on the shelves. There are never enough checkout lanes available (by design) so other workers are expected to join the checkout area when it gets busy. The veteran employees have figured out personal hiding places and disappear when they are called, however. Half the day is spent cleaning up after customers and we're not even a restaurant. It's a discount store that doesn't care about its employees and caters to the most difficult customers in existence: the poor, the uneducated, and the homeless. General turnover was horrendous and the person who trained me quit only months later. The store manager was a ghost whom I've never met. My greatest amusement was talking to salespeople (DirecTV & others) who tried to pitch things to Walmart customers.

I loved working there.

I never had a rude customer or coworker. I'd go into work all smiles & with a positive attitude. I was a greatly appreciated associate but I wanted to move up or possibly transfer & the higher up managers take forever to do so. They wanted to keep me up front because I ""was such a great front end associate & so many people call in regards to courtesy calls"". I was hired on as a cashier & was later coded for money services but for some reason I was always asked to push carts or go run the customer service desk (which was not in my job description). I also had lower back spasms from pushing carts & my managers knew that & I was still asked to push carts & was penalized when I wasn't able to work & the same thing with the flu.

I enjoyed my years as personnel training coordinator,"The associates were  the best in their jobs. I enjoyed management also. Everyone was very respectful, friendly. I worked in the office 3 days and did support for managers 2 days which consisted of making sure front end and customers were taken care in a efficient, fast manner. Make sure dress code was followed at all times. Help morale by being outgoing and upbeat. I also was in charge of the whole facility so manager could go to lunch or go to another store. I had to make sure the licensure were up to date. The cashiers, sales floor associates, department managers, and managers seem to gasp the urgency to complete tasks in a timely manner. This cause everyone to work closely together. There were a lot of promotions during my time at 7209, such as customer service manager was promoted to assistant manager.

Bad management makes this job harder than it should be. They are disconnected from the realities of the job, and do not put their associates first. There is also a lot of favoritism and back scratching which means that they tend to promote the least qualified. High turnover is largely due to management.

Great pay and benefits awful management,"The people you meet at Walmart are great, and if you stick with it the pay is great. The problem I have with it is that you will have no home life if  you move up. Weekends are required and if you have a set availability your hours will be cut for spite. Not all of the management team is awful but most are. they are scatter brained, only care about the numbers and they do not feel the need to help ever unless the store is getting a visit from higher management and then its not even really helping. Its faking all the issues for the moment and then going right back into chaos. They speak of keeping on process but refuse to hire the people you need to stay on this process and then yell at you for not getting everything that is asked of you finished. You are only allowed to get 5 points in a 6 month period. Sure if you have been there long enough you will get protected time but it accrues very slowly and the amount you are allowed to get depends on your time with the company. This used to be a great place to work for but i would not recommend it unless you are fond of doing the work of multiple people and getting no thanks or any kind of appreciation.",2,Current Employee,Supervisor ,Nc,9/19/19,2019,9,19
stressfull and demanding,"At first the job was easy to do and somedays it feels rewarding but it didn't stay that way for long. The managers that help and support the team was let go being replaced by ones how don't help and walking around on their phones. Ever since year two a typical day will be like me running around trying to fit everything on the shelves no matter what as long as its reasonable, trying to please the managers. The most enjoyable part of this job is talking to the costumers and my fellow stockers but the hardest part is to finish the all the work in your areas when the team is stretched thin, which is often. All management cares is if everything is done, if they ask you how you doing they actually asking is your area almost done.

Lower management,"Lower management  is poor. They are cashier managemnt but do not respond to cashiers in timely fashion. When cashiers are managed by a team of people who have to open locked cabinets in the front, check something on cashiers register, etc. And they take a long time to respond, the cashier also looks bad. The cashiers share drawers so is it really safe and clear cut as they like you to think it is when talleys and counts are made by humans every few hours? Cashiering is fun as far as contact with customers and not stressful when you are able to get your lines down. Walmart usually does not have enough staff. It is not a horrible place to start off at.

Pleasant and enjoyable environment,Walmart is a good place to work with good team mates and a busy day which makes it good to keep busy. I learned that timing is everything in the retail business because in order to serve the customers the shelves have to be stocked so freight must be put out daily.                                          Management was always helpful and pleasant and pitch right in if needed to.                                                                                                                 The hardest part of the job was moving the freight off the truck because of the bulkiness but then it seem to all fall into place after that.

Its a lot of miscommunication going on and a lot of management that takes their role to the extreme when it comes to talking to their associates.

It's a job.,"As a recent pharmacy graduate, I can reflect over the past 4 years spent with the company. Retrospectively, I admittedly should have left when I thought it was best to. Which was after about the first quarter spent there during my first year as an intern in 2015. It wasn't all bad, and by the time I was laid off, I wish I hadn't been. _x000D__x000D_The pros? I had a great preceptor for the first year or so. He went above and beyond to help guide me along and to encourage the ambition I brought to work every day, but that's one person and not the company. So, I guess the pros for the company would be that they have money. I've worked for other retail companies with less and the workload was obviously different between them. Walmart provides so many fail-safes, that it makes it near impossible to make a mistake. For a pharmacist, that's a huge plus. Especially in the face of today's pressures for volume. _x000D__x000D_The cons? As a doctor with training in pharmacotherapy and medication therapy management, I will be the first to say that it's a shame how corporate pharmacy chains ""utilize"" the depth of education and skills pharmacists should be expected to have. While it should be no surprise that all retail chains are like this, my experience with Walmart was incredibly stunting. I was there when they unrolled new MTM software. In fact I was the first to interview a patient during my first year as a pharmacy student. When they unrolled Narcan under CDTA, I was the first to convince a patient of the need, and was frequently the employee that made it happen for that store.

Not recommendable,"Very strict on the rules, management is ridiculous. Nobody should have to quit or get fired for their percentage specially when it's slow and hardly enough work.  The way they treat people, work us like slaves. They are trying to get rid of most of Walmart people so they can hire more sovereign people. So they wont have to pay so much to Walmart people, based on my experience I've there 6 yrs I wont ever work again treated me like I don't know how to do anything and kept giving me occurrences and steps because they weren't satisfied with my production I wasn't go fast enough.",1,Former Employee,Packer ,"Fort Worth, TX 76006",9/18/19,2019,9,18

They simply care about profits. And they will defend the customer regardless of how egregious or atrocious the offense. It is rather nauseating to say the least.

It didn't really feel like I could advance there due to physical and mental limitations that I personally have.

When you ask for help for a customer or other things people will say there’s no one in that area instead of saying that they could help the customer. Some managers will say that’s not my job even if it is. We only get a 10 percent discount but not for food. You overwork yourself and don’t get enough pay.

Pay sucks for such an enormous corporation and they consistently understaff and overwork everyone.  Even if you land a halfway decent position with okay pay and your boss doesn't constantly breathe down your neck, cronyism and lack of proactivity are rampant at every location.  They claim there's a culture of positivity but there's a way more obvious subculture starting with department managers and moving up from there of ignoring problems and sucking up.

"Overburdened when hourly manager, salaried positions are nice","I worked at Walmart for almost two years.  I was promoted 4 times and worked all sections of the store at all times of the week.  My final position was the Overnight Front End Manager.  The entry level positions were easy to acquire and perform with above average pay.  It was great if you're just starting out.  If you're looking to live you'll quickly need to advance.  People are constantly being hired and quitting so positions open up often. Which sounds great but also warrants concerns. As the manager it was my duty to oversee the overnight crew, solve customer issues, handle the finances, and restore the store to pristine condition each night.  The work load was extraordinarily stressful due to the lack of proper procedures, sheer size of the building, and staffing. While the pay was above average by comparison of other similar positions, the pay was not enough to afford basic living by yourself.  I ended up having to get a second job and was working 16-22 hours a day, 6-7 days a week to make my bills.",3,Former Employee,FRONT END MANAGER ,"Clearwater, FL",9/15/19,2019,9,15

They got to the point where they actually started diminishing benefits and perks that once made for a strong and united workforce. They promote from within but, watch out if you happen to get promoted because it seems to me the managers are just a place to pin the blame for ANY issues in the building.

Underpaid and Overworked,"I’ve got some good memories in TLE, yet there’s a lot that needs to improve. To begin, I have to say that TLE is misunderstood by upper management and completely different from the rest of Walmart. You get dirty, sweaty, and deal with customers who want their vehicles worked on yesterday; however, corporate policy and mis-management tie one hand behind your back and expect you to “grab those Benjamins” with the other. For example, staffing was so bad at my store (2544) that I had to run the whole shop on a few occasions with no direct supervisor, which violates OSHA, company policy, and common sense; however, upper management refused to allow me to close up. All jobs deal with staffing issues, but there’s a big difference between not having bacon on the shelf and listening to customers berate and roll their eyes at you because your coworker took a two hour lunch and you (how dare you!) can’t possibly do the oil change and the four tire job in the other bay at the same time. It’s truly sad because there is a lot of potential for this to be a fun and rewarding job, yet they routinely hire two snails for every good worker and everyone is paid nearly the same. That said, my time there as a young man was very educational. I learned a lot from the guys I worked with about those living near or below the poverty line and the mentality that keeps some there. I also learned that if you work hard and try to do more, like volunteering to get numbers to run the register in order to help customer wait time, Walmart won’t give you any more of a raise than what is standard and will still treat - more...",3,Former Employee,Tire and Lube Technician ,"Portage, IN",9/15/19,2019,9,15

It's okay... but,"Working for Walmart pays the bills... I feel as though Walmart is too big. Too many associates, too many customers, too much management. I'm currently a CSM and have been all over the store. I like it, but I feel as though everything changes way too much. We are expected to follow and enforce certain policies, but sometimes it's okay to break them... Management gets upset when you enforce them talking about ""why didnt you just take care of the customer?"" other times, they will say ""you weren't supposed to do that and you know that..."". It's like we can never really do anything right. Not everything is always disclosed properly to the customer in the sense of return policies. It's not on the back of the receipt, it's just on return mats at the service desk, and electronics. Who would even think to go and look there? Then on top of that a lot of Walmart.com items you can't return in store because of them being Marketplace items which gets us cussed out frequently. We also have the ability to ""write up"" or as Walmart calls it ""coach"" our associates to correct bad behavior, but then when we try to our manager just wants to pull them in the office and talk. We never can do anything anymore which is why our cashiers are pretty much able to walk all over us. That and I've seen at other Walmarts poorly trained associates.

The Company is so frightened by the “Me Too” movement, that they will investigate any unsupported comments or gossip uttered by anyone.

The work culture was very similar to a highschool. But i wasnt there to make friends. i wanted to be the best at my job and eventually i was able to become top csr. My manager at the time though was very two-faced. She wanted you to succeed in your face, but she didnt keep confidential conversations from you to her confidential. i would overhear her saying them to other of the team members about other peoples personal lives.

Chain Reaction,"Poor management is mainly why my career ended in TLE. Could never get new techs in the shop, but expected us to get cars out like other place. We only had 4 “certified” techs, and 2 trainees. Supposed to have 4 per bay, so we were lacking at least 10 people in the shop. _x000D__x000D_Then, TLE manager telling us to do one thing, then realized what it looked like on cameras, saved her butt by not telling other management the story. So they didn’t believe us, and started the TLE shut down. _x000D__x000D_They wait till your shift is almost over to “talk” to you. First tech went back, over an hour later, I see him grab his stuff and get walked out. Then they wouldn’t give me any answers cause the management team was busy till about the time I was supposed to leave. How convenient. So I quit. TLE supervisor found out he was next on the chopping block, and quit. Another tech went in and quit after us cause he hated working there. And a service writer is quitting at the end of the pay period. _x000D__x000D_Walmart wasn’t bad to start out at, but later you learn management is terrible and places responsibility’s on other people, saving each other’s butts. _x000D__x000D_If you have an interview for Walmart TLE, RUN.",2,Former Employee,Lube and Tire Technician ,"Charlotte, MI",9/13/19,2019,9,13
"Competitive workplace, very fast pace.",Being a personal shopper was very physical work because the groceries were heavy. When the store got busy dealing with customers came into play a lot.

The managers themselves are never even there, they all make time adjustments to get paid more hours than they are actually there for.

Average,"It's been a while but from what I remember. Most days are fairly average. Then there is suddenly a mad scramble and management is stressing out for a corporate visit, upcoming inventory or Black Friday. So, all that stress naturally gets distributed throughout the rest of the store. The only solace is that pretty much all the other employees are in a similar boat as you so that is where the best bonds happen and can take some of the stress away.",3,Former Employee,DEPARTMENT MANAGER ,"North Tonawanda, NY",9/12/19,2019,9,12

It was an okay first job,"Some days it’s an okay place to work, other days it’s a terrible place to work. Pay is alright for the work, and benefits are fine but getting full time hours is tough. Schedules are inconsistent, and poorly done leaving associates by themselves or having to cover multiple departments that no one was scheduled. Throwing associates in places they are not trained for and destined to fail. You get used to it but it’s not something you want to get used to. Other aspects depends on who your direct supervisor is.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Crowley, TX",9/12/19,2019,9,12

THE Place to Work at,"To start, its fun and easy to begin learning all the responsibilities.

Excellent transferable experience,"The pay was great...until you’re made to work 60+hours a week.  The benefits and bonus incentives were great! I wouldn’t have many negative things to say if we were provided with the tools and resources necessary to be successful.  More and more tasks and responsibilities, less and less employees.  I can’t delegate a task to no one. It reaches a tipping point where the way this company chooses to cut cost puts a severe detriment on proper business operations and customer service.  You can’t have one without the other.  I often felt set up for failure.  In my first month as a salaried manager I was put over the front end, fuel station, apparel, and home lines! Over half the store really.  We were also heading into the holidays which made it worse.  How can a company set you up like that with such unrealistic expectations?! I was the newest one and had the most responsibility, which hardly seems fair.  This job is not for the faint of heart and is widely considered the most difficult job in the store for good reason.  When it got to the point of having to take PTO just to see or spend any real time with my family, I had to resign.  Some things are more important than money.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Texas,9/12/19,2019,9,12

"The overall store is ok, it's the management that sucks.","When I worked at Walmart some time ago, a family member and I were working there even though we were in two different places, I was treated poorly and so was my family member, and when we had asked for different departments due to issues, we were denied. My family member had asked for an earlier work schedule so they could go home and see their own family, but they were denied as well. When I was being sexually harassed by an older co-worker, nothing was done.",1,Former Employee,Clothing Associate ,"Susanville, CA",9/12/19,2019,9,12

Personal opinion,It's a place that hires you at a part time schedule to work you full time hours at a certain amount of weeks and put you back into part time hours to stop you from being hire full time to receive benefits from the company. Management and employees are never on the same page. I wouldn't recommend this employer unless you were going directly into a management position.,3,Former Employee,"Garden Center, Department Manager, TLE ","Shreveport, LA",9/12/19,2019,9,12

Overworked and underappreciated,"Managment at walmart really doesn't care about their workers or any problem they have until it becomes and inconvenience to them and they HAVE to act. In which case they'll just straight up coach or fire you cause it makes their life easier. And thats if they even know what they are coaching you for as one of my previous managers gave me a coaching for a ""lack of productivity"" even though I'd done twice the work he thought I had and when he actually saw that after coaching me, didn't have the balls to man up and admit that he made a mistake and reverse the coaching.

Walmart,"It may not be at all stores but my personal experience with Walmart was not the greatest. I started out as a CAP2 associate and was thrown into the CAP2 Supervisor position without any kind of training. The management team at the store I worked at failed miserably at communicating with staff and fellow teammates. No one was treated equally and there were always people getting written up for incidents while the managements pets got away with it.  We went to training courses throughout the year and learned process and procedures that the overall corporation was to follow, but when we tried to instill them at our store we were shut down by the store manager and assistants on multiple occasions. The benefits and bonuses for the company are great but you have to be prepared for a lot of things that are not done with common sense.",2,Former Employee,Supervisor ,"Bonner Springs, KS",9/12/19,2019,9,12

Lack of accountablility,"They do not hold people accountable for thier actions. I got stuck busting my butt, while many of my coworkers and direct supervisor didn't. My direct supervisor came to work stoned almost everyday. I informed her boss and was told they couldn't do anything about even though they could tell. She would come to work and disappear for extended periods of time. It's would of been an excellent job if it wasn't for having to deal with that and the fact of dealing with getting talked to like a dog by some other employees.",1,Former Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Owensville, MO",9/12/19,2019,9,12

Very stressful work place,"A typical day at work depends on the customers and the managers, whether it be a good or bad day. I learned to be patient with people and money responsibility.

Opinion on Wal-Mart,"Depending on the day, some days were fun and some days were just the usual thing that we would normally do. When I was at Walmart i learned a lot while I was there like how to build endcaps, features, stackbases and a lot more. Management worked with my schedule when I needed a day off or a specific day that I needed off until further notice. The workplace culture was okay. The behaviors of some associates would bring people down in a bad mood. If you walk in to Wal-Mart all happy and an associate you talk to is in a negative mindset it just puts you in that kind of mindset and then you feel miserable the rest of your shift. The hardest part of the job was there was not really anything hard about it. It was self explanatory after you go through training and get the hang of your job description. The most enjoyable part of the job was to do firearm sales and do the freight.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Reno, NV",9/11/19,2019,9,11

False Hopes,"Walmart has changed dramatically. They are more interested in watching cashiers from overhead cameras for mistakes than they are at stopping thieves. Formal admonishment is given for one mis-scanned item yet no thanks is given for loss prevention of multiple items. Scheduling is ridiculous i.e. work till 11 p.m. (or later) and then be expected back the next day at 7 a.m. (or earlier). They have gone from appreciating and taking care to keep good and reliable employees to forcing them out with poor scheduling and very poor bonuses. Your weekly schedule may vary from 6 hours to possibly 30 if they decide to show favor on you. Keeping customers happy as they have to wait relatively long periods of time for assistance in the fragrance, jewelry, fabric, locked liquor/tobacco departments as well as having to wait for managers at registers for transaction approvals. Some managers are rude and outright nasty in the way that they speak with or even ignore employee questions. Very sad, which is why I am seeking more stable employment.

An OK job depending on what you're looking for,"I worked at Walmart for a few months. The interview process was fairly easy and they offered me a job on the spot.

Starting pay is $11 and you get good benefits (discounts, stock options, educational opportunities, 401K, etc.) after working there for three months. However, management was frowned upon. As a cashier, I would heavily rely on management for some duties, and they would take forever to respond. Sometimes they would forget about my breaks, and one manager scheduled me for a time I wasn't supposed to work.

After that I would break the truck down and put everything on carts so other produce associates can start working product. Management was probably the worst I've seen in any place I have worked. No communication at all between assistant store managers and store manger. You would have to tell multiple managers just to be heard if you had to get a day off or anything else. Workplace culture was like any other retail place.

"Walmart treats their employees like dogs, actually dogs get treated better","I opened this new store and then worked for wm for 2 1/2 years. I was hired as a skilled cake decorator, but was told after 2 yrs that I had to help in deli. (Never officially trained) they would cut hours more and more and not hire anyone and expect whoever was in the department to do everyone elses work plus your own and then some.  I am a hard worker and give 150% of myself,  but they expect too much _x000D_I would then have to stop doing cakes and go to deli to help.

It has been bad,"Management hardly ever makes sure to keep their employees safety an well being in mind. Not only that, but their standards are unrealistic and unfair.

Good and Bad,"It depends on the State and the stores that you work at to really decide if Walmart is ideal for you. I had the pleasure of working 2 different ones in Arizona and loved it. I went from an Associate to being promoted to General Merchandise Support Manager. The management teams and staff at both locations were great and fun to work with.Of course like any place, there were some managers and staff that were not ideal to work with.

Confusing work place,"Walmart was an OK job. I went threw 3 interviews with each being a different manager. Training took a few days with a whole gift being on a computer in HR. The lady that did the new hire orientation explained information that was inaccurate and caused about 3 employees, including myself a job.

The Best First Job,"Walmart gives a young person the best look into the public workforce, starting them at the lowest position, but offering easy advancement. The simple training instructs you what to be on the lookout for and makes you more aware of the stresses and difficulties of an hourly retail associate._x000D__x000D_The strongest takeaway from Walmart employment is the interaction with people of all cultures and classes in the surrounding area.

Walmart can be a fun place to work,I worked overnight. Sure there are come customers that come in at night but most of them will not bother you for anything. Working as a Stocker you are part of a team that is the whole store. you are responsible for your section and if you or someone else is done quicker than expected then that person goes to the next section to help out. Sometimes you get someone right away to start with. There is nothing wrong with socializing for a few minutes as long as you get your work done.

"Too many chiefs, not enough indians","There were managers, many mangers, all telling you to do different things. Many of them mistreated me daily. I sucked it up and did my best. Dangerous working conditions persisted. I'll give you an example: One manager had to retrieve a shelf. These shelves were in the back room. You had to climb an enormous ladder and climb almost to the top to get them. It was very unsafe. He climbed the ladder and was taking down a shelf and it split his face open. I had similar incidents happen because shelves were stacked on top of each other and not inserted into the wall like they should've been. There was a skeleton crew, meaning you had to do the job of several people. I got hired for the Garden Center and I ended up working in every other department. Not a bad thing overall, but when there's not enough help, it's a very bad thing. They paid me $10.00 an hour which is a joke for how much profit they generate. Back to managers for a sec: There's Department Managers, Assistant Managers, Co-Managers, and the Store Manager. Oh yeah, and Support Managers. Why do you need that many managers? It's ridiculous. Some of the employees are cool. I met a lot of nice people. Most of the customers that come through were friendly, some were not, especially around the holidays. Being a cashier was a boring, unsatisfying job. Working in the Garden Center I routinely had to pick up grills that weighed a lot. Some of these had to be taken down with a pallet jack. It took so long to get someone to help. They didn't train us to use the thing!

Walmart use to be about the associates and culture,Walmart is just about money. Associates do not matter. They fire those who near retirement or actually have an opinion.

I have seen a worse place to work but this comes 2nd in my book,"Walmart is a terrible place to be employed and a great way to go nowhere in life. Management will not follow company policy and associates never know how to do their job (or even try). For example, the location of St James avenue recycles nothing and uses chemicals they aren't allowed to because with no system of disposal, they are poured down the drain. Walmart also takes advantage of its disabled workers and it is sad. For 3 months straight this company made violations giving me close-open constantly every week calling me back in to work without an 8 hour period off the clock. I gave the company open availability 7 days saying only that i couldn't open right after closing. They continued to ignore my availability forms. I have never dealt with a company like this before. My wife and I left and she sold her Wal-Mart stock.

Under-staffed and no communcation,"Most days begin with a to-do list of what was missed yesterday with today's additions, such as change of seasonal signage. Though a great system the practice was undermined by the establishment as other areas would pull associates from their designated areas to compensate for lack of associates in another. Often leaving the prior to-do list left to one to two employees for an entire department and often without any management to ask for guidance. This resulted in most people being kind where they can be but cut-throat in putting their department priorities before helping any other.",2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Fallon, NV",9/8/19,2019,9,8

"Stressful, unfair, overbearing management and unreasonable workloads.",Wal Mart dismissed 70 percent of their full time staff when I worked there. I was told they were going to do that about a year in advance. They began cutting staff and treating their employees contemptibly. It became intolerable and the work load and demand for higher and higher perfection of work performance became rediculous. Screaming at and belittling employees by management became commonplace. Threats and being called to the office for reprimands became more and more frequent. I watched as one by one our team of 15 deli members were whittled down to about 5. The work load of 15 was put upon those remaining. I am glad that I was released from Wal Mart. I had a breakdown because of the work schedule and job pressure. They scheduled people to close until after midnight and then come into work at 5 am. Very unfair and unhealthy.

Benefits are great,The Store Manager should be interested in the store as a whole. The store I work at only care about the shelves being stocked. I'm a front end manager and I have to fight to keep my cashiers on the register to check out customers. They will remove the cashiers to stock and zone and then look for me when lines are backed up. Not worth it.,5,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Lake Charles, LA",9/8/19,2019,9,8
They do not appreciate hard work. I learned they act like they care but don't. Management has no clue what's going on and really don't care.,I've worked many places in Pueblo and thought this huge corporation would be different. They do not appreciate hard work and do not reprimand people who don't. They will let you do all the work and expect more while some employees just do what they want. Which means they don't even pull their weight. So let's just say those employees are getting paid while we do their job.  Don't get me wrong there are some management that care but nothing they can do. They aren't even happy themselves. This place is not worth the stress.

Competitive environment,"I'd start off by redlining my lane which is organizing the candies, chips, etc. Then I'd call to get the money for my register and just wait for the crowd to come. The management was on top of the cashiers and in turn it brought the best out of me. The workplace isn't too family oriented its actually pretty transient. people come and go so often. The job honestly didn't challenge me bt it was hard when the register broke down and I had a line already.

It was hard at times, but I really enjoyed working alongside my co-workers, because they all have their own life story. I still do, in fact._x000D__x000D_But after half a year of working there, I realized the place is nothing more the adult equivalent of high school. It's all privilege and favoritism. The managers pick and choose who they want to do certain jobs based on their relationship with them. I've been trained to work the service desk, but they won't ever let me on there. I've asked numerous times to be trained in Money Center, but they always refuse. I don't want to spend my entire life on a register, staying in one spot. I want to keep moving forward and learn new things, but the managers don't see it that way._x000D__x000D_There are plenty of things wrong with the place and it would take too long to list everything wrong with it. If it weren't for the fact that the company pays for my schooling, I'd have left ages ago. Simply put, if you think about working for Walmart, don't.

"A learning experience, mostly about bad work place practices","As someone who was struggling to find work for many years after college, I was at first excited when I got the job opportunity at the new Walmart Neighborhood Market that was opening up. People seemed friendly and like they wanted you to go far. However I soon realized it was sugar coated where favoritism was alive and well and it wasn't how well you did, it was who you knew and how you worked the system._x000D__x000D_Most of the time I worked there, I was usually the only cashier on a register for at least four hours, if not six, and my supervisor would be the other only employee on the front end with me. I was constantly judged to be going slow because of my line, not based on my actual speed. Being the only cashier on busier days, it was very easy to get a line, especially with how some customers acted or reacted to you. Every customer had their way of bagging and usually you were somehow meant to know ahead of time what it was. Being on the edge of a city thatbanned paper bags, a number of customers wanted paper bags which compared to plastic bags, slowed down bagging and therefore would generate lines easier. This was usually because I had two slots for paper bags compared to the already open four and ready to go four slots of plastic bags._x000D__x000D_It seemed like any cashier that wasn't a closer, would completely neglect any cleaning and would leave their register for the closing cashier to clean up._x000D__x000D_Most of the managers I worked with didn't care for the front end and usually please customers just to get them out of their hair, irregardless of how badly that customer treated their - more...",1,Current Employee,Cashier Associate ,"Springfield, OR",9/7/19,2019,9,7

can be alright depending on management,It largely depends on the management at your location as to how good of a environment the store will have. in my time there it has only gotten worse though as we have moved to a skeleton crew only with no sign of change even as we ask for more people to just cover time,2,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Niceville, FL",9/7/19,2019,9,7

Management was lacking and never coordinated with each other. The employees had a free run of the place but I did enjoy working there.,They gave an hour paid lunch which was both positive and negative but management was really lacking when it came to knowing what employees were doing in the store.,3,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate/ Customer Service ,"Pittston, PA",9/7/19,2019,9,7
"terrible company to work for, no communication","Co-workers great, no communications with upper management, mis communication, favoritism, just disorganized completely at the store I worked at_x000D_Time accrual and rules about ""occurrences"" are unfair an because of poor manager/corporate communication with workers and poor documentation workers get penalized after having approval for time off or sickness",1,Former Employee,P.M.Stocker ,"Painted Post, NY",9/7/19,2019,9,7
Sucked,"I will never work at Walmart again. Management is biased, takes out their stress on you, and expects you to do their job for them.

Wasn't what I was expecting,"I worked with Wal Mart for a year in the bakery and deli. I enjoyed what I did, for the most part. I like to bake and I had tons of experience with food so it came natural to me, but there were several things I didn't like and they mainly revolve around management. The department managers half the time didn't know what they were doing. I was always being accused of doing something that I didn't do and threatened to be written up for it, but in my opinion that was just because the managers were too lazy to follow up after each shift to really know what was going on. I was expected to work like a robot. The fact that I was only a human, and one person at that didn't matter to them. Everything had to be perfect all of the time and we had little help. Not to mention the way they talked to us was less than professional, and I can say this because I have five years of management experience under my belt. In my opinion, overall the management sucks and it started all the way from the top, the store manager.",1,Former Employee,Fresh Production Associate ,"San Antonio, TX 78214",9/7/19,2019,9,7

Busy,"I was a part-time cashier for about 8 years while working for Wal-Mart.  The reason I was unable to work full time was being diagnosed with a disability.  To maintain eligibility for SSDI the federal government placed monthly and annual income restrictions on what I could earn while still receiving benefits.  I have some Visual Limitations and Bipolar Disorder.  If you have shopped with Wal-Mart, you will notice the Cashier is also responsible for sacking your Merchandise which is uncommon when you go to your neighborhood grocery store, furniture store or are buying a new car (if you have the financial resources) and often when you are getting a Prescription filled.  Cashiers are also grossly underpaid for the arrogant attitude often displayed by a few who shop there.  Usually, I just took the abuse until one day when an older White lady and her Daughter came to my line demanding that I ""hurry it up blind boy"" then I asked them what that mixed breed animal was in their cart who was throwing candy bars all over the store.  I am also White which is irrelevant except when you call me a ""blind boy"" and expect me to take it for $11.00 per hour as though I have no feelings.  If you are shopping at store # 3273 just realize this will get them fired and you can treat any associate like trash and get away with it.

I normally was scheduled 37 hours a week, and then it dropped down to 5 hours a week. I was looking for another job anyway. When I started they worked around my schedule and the assistant manager who was overseeing my department at the the time was awesome.

I'm sure if I  were in a different department I would've enjoyed it more, however, I didn't get a say. There were (and still are) so desperate for workers that they place people anywhere. The process of being hired was weird because the lady pulled me randomly and told me to put in an application and then took me back to HR and I was hired. No interview.

Terrible,"You can only call out 5 times before they fire you. Each point that you get takes 6 month to get rid of. They expect you to do so much with little pay. I was a cashier and I was never able to leave out on time. Management is terrible. I tried to get transferred and they gave me the run around. A girl that worked less than 6 months was able to transfer, but I worked there for over 6 months and they never did anything to help me transfer. The CSMs are never to be found when you need them. Each day I worked 5hrs and 30mins and I was only allowed one little 15min break. I always had to put piles of re-shop back and deal with long lines all the time for only one short break. They fired a cashier for attendance, but the only reason she was gone was because she had health problems. The lady told them that in advance when they hired her. You can only get a 10% discount and Walmart is picky about what you can use that discount on. The discount only takes $1 or $2 off and taxes adds it right back up. Everyone have to work on Holidays. If you call out on holidays, that is an automatic 3 points. I worked on Thanksgiving one time and they gave everyone that worked on Thanksgiving a 25% discount card on the last day the card was usable. They told us that we could only use the card on our break or if we were clocked out and the card expired at midnight.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Washington, DC",9/5/19,2019,9,5

It's retail,"Walmart is a basic retail job. You clock in, you do your job, you clock out. The anti-union propaganda is a bit creepy, but the retail market is so competitive that Walmart already has to offer good working conditions and pay to keep its workforce, so it's not likely unionizing would get much more (this may not be true where Walmart is basically the only employer and workers have few other options). Unless you're dramatically unprofessional or rude to a customer, it's not likely you'll get fired, but by the same token if you're not really going out of your way to go the extra mile, it's almost impossible to get noticed and tapped for advancement.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Manager ,"Lynchburg, VA",9/5/19,2019,9,5
not the worst,"i hate to say this but i am going to. walmart can be a great place to work for but they do have some horrible and stupid managers. but not all are that way. some of the managers are smart, understanding, and great people. but the worst part of walmart is like some other jobs. it is the urgency of getting positions filled so their associates are not getting over worked for long periods of time. for me my position should have 10 associates in that area. this way we could have 5-7 associates on a day but we have had 6-7 associates for the last three months at the low we have had 5 for a week. and at the high in the last 3 months was 7. but 3 of them was new associates to the company that needed to be fully trained into the job not just trained into what that area of the store needs to learn. if a person transferred from a different area of the store to the area i work only need to learn the quality and main process of that area. but a new associate needs to learn not just the quality they need to look for, the speed, where product needs to go, what product we work, but also how to use the hand held devices. which takes more time for training. also we have long term associates that work in that area and we have vacation times and we would like to take it but we also do not want to short the rest of our crew so we do not use our vacation time so that we have enough people to work the area and not overload the rest of the crew. but the upper managers only see how what is on the paper, the numbers we are hitting, the fact we are able to get the main job done with so little, and the - more...",3,Current Employee,Fresh Cap 1 Associate ,"Menomonie, WI",9/5/19,2019,9,5

Keeps you busy,"It was 9 hour shifts. 8 hour working, 1 hour lunch. The time flew by because most days we had big trucks to unload with around over 3,000 boxes. It'd take around 2 1/2 hours to get the truck unloaded and another hour for me to get the boxes put where they go. So by that time I was already halfway through the shift. But it wasn't a horrible job just didn't feel like I was getting paid enough, I was doing all that hard labor while getting paid the same as a door greeter.",3,Former Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Gainesville, TX",9/4/19,2019,9,4

Job duties were fun everything else was childish,I enjoyed my job duties but the management team was beyond ridiculous and spent more time talking behind people's backs rather than doing their jobs. Many ethics issues and borderline harassment but no one really seemed to care. Team building exercises were beyond childish and may as well have been in a day care. If you want time off or weekends off forget it even if you request time off for your own wedding it'll be denied.,1,Former Employee,Asset Protection Specialist ,"Woodburn, OR",9/4/19,2019,9,4

Would not Recommend,"Walmart’s a job if your in between jobs,  management is horrible, over 18 years Walmart has taken away more from me then they have given, raises are only 2% to everyone.

Productive & stressful all at once,"The typical work job that i did was maintenance at first I was happy, but then it came to be a fast passed job. I learn that customers always like feeling like at home good environmental place, clean sanitize restrooms, clean floors, ect. The hardest part of the job was that they expected to much out of one person you had to multi-task like for example if john needed help stocking up the shelves but you needed to mop clean the restrooms and take out trash you had to do everything fast.

Great pt job with good pay and fun coworkers if you're friendly,"sometimes very fast paced, other times is was slower and you had to make it look like you were doing something. The management was generally very nice and fun to work with--loved the people there. The pay was also good, although I only wanted to work 20 hour weeks and ended up getting scheduled for almost double that. I tried to get that changed but it was difficult to get a hold of the right people. When I put in my two weeks notice because I was moving, it was almost impossible to do because the hr staff is usually gone, even when they say they'll be there.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"South Jordan, UT",9/4/19,2019,9,4

Mismanaged and toxic,"During my time working at Walmart, I experienced a total lack of dutiful management, and employee mental state seemed to be very grim/depressing. Job security, and some corporate rules, give employees the ability to feel content. Under its current management/practice, I would not recommend anyone I know to work at the same Walmart as I did. Also, my review does not apply to the entire Walmart corporation, just the Walmart Super Center at Comstock Park.",1,Current Employee,"Stocker, Backroom, & Receiving Associate ","Grand Rapids, MI",9/4/19,2019,9,4
Work/Life Balance poor,Work/Life balance is virtually non-existent depending on your store manager. The position overall is very enjoyable and can be very exciting at times.

Good if you need a job,"The experience varied, was good at times, like first company to promote me and the managers, when they liked me, tried very hard to help me/my career.

Great pay but horrible work environment,"I work in the maintenance department at a distribution center.  Primary job is lift truck maintenance but also work in refrigerated section at times.  Very little training, you are expected to know how to fix everything perfectly the first time.  I have been in maintenance for many years and never touched a forklift but now I'm expected to be a master mechanic who diagnoses and repairs these trucks like an expert.  This was not explained to me during the interview,  The pay is above average and the hours are decent.  But the favoritism is excessive.  If your manager likes you, you're assigned special projects all day and can goof off with no supervision.  If you are just one of the regular mechanics, you do nothing but PM lift trucks and cold side error chasing.  The cold side is 24 degrees and freezer is 10 below zero.  Nobody wants to work on the cold side.  You are written up for simple mistakes like a bad time punch or not cleaning a lift truck perfectly.  HR is a joke, they say they will help with concerns but when you bring anything to HR's attention, your manager is informed immediately and you will be retaliated against.  I've been there over a year and I'm currently looking for another job.  As soon as I find something close to home I will leave, I'd go now but like everybody else I have bills to pay.  Good thing maintenance jobs are plentiful, shouldn't have to wait too long.",1,Former Employee,Maintenance Technician ,"Pottsville, PA",9/4/19,2019,9,4

Easy work and they are flexible. Pay didnt scale well.,"Walmart is an ok company to work for. Honestly it helped pay the bills and having discounts and access to merchandise is ok.

never again,"It's not a bad job for retail, but the company is uncaring and cold by nature. Their policy is to fire anyone who misses 4 days in 6 months (8 if you can make it past that) and nothing can save you. I saw a manger of 11 years fired because they wouldn't approve her time off and she had to attend her 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER'S BRAIN SURGERY. she was fired. for THAT. Others were fired for taking too long to recover after a miscarriage, and of course there's the ones that get the flu and can't come into work, and not even a doctors note can excuse you. Walmart if an unfeeling machine and even at it's best you can tell that if you couldn't keep up it would steamroll right over you. don't work here unless you're desperate, and don't fall for the fake HR speech. in walmart it's keep up or get out.",1,Former Employee,Customer Service representative ,"Jackson, MO",9/4/19,2019,9,4

Productive,Once you find the right store location and position that suites you walmart can be a good place to work.  The employees need to be/think team players.

"Lackluster management, blamed for not doing the work of multiple people","I worked CAP team 2 and knew from the start the group was in low supply of labor due to all of us interviewees being asked several times to recommend this job to any friends or family we had. After the first month, we dropped to only 6 on the team. We were each expected to pick up the slack left by the lack of employees, and everyone was responsible for doing the work of 2 people. Even though I was one of the few to finish MY work in time, I was still blamed and regarded as not fast enough. The management was poor: our one supervisor was someone who hated our team and requested to transfer.

Great place as long as you have no other engagements,"Walmart has high standards when it comes to its employees, requiring both speed, customer service, initiative, and especially attendance. Once you start working there, they expect you to be present when you are required, and not after, or even before. They’re also very testy about initiative which I’m not exactly sure what they are looking for.",4,Former Employee,Remodel Associate ,"Clearfield, PA",9/3/19,2019,9,3
Great benefits,A typical day would be lots of customer inquires. I have learned to be patient and more attentive to my surroundings.

"If you are in high school or college, its not a bad place to work at","It all depends on the people you work with. The Walmart I worked at was the biggest of the state and was busy almost every day and management in the front was always chill. If you work hard and show you want to move forward, there are always opportunities. Was given many opportunities to move forward, but I denied them all since I knew I wasn't going to be working there for too long. Even as a part timer, I was given just about 30 to 35 hours a week and that brought in quite a bit of extra cash, especially the quarterly bonuses that were very big. You get two paid 15 minute breaks an hour lunch and a 15% discount card after 6 months if I remember correctly.Oh and there is no dress code at all, as long as its appropriate of course. Express yourself how you want either its your tattoos or piercings or hair color. Again as long as they are appropriate for tattoos and piercings. Most if not all of management is chill and most become your friends. I got bored of working here and the reason I left since was because I wasted 3 years of my life only to get payed a few cents more than the new people getting hired today.",4,Former Employee,CASHIER ,"13770 W Bell Rd, Surprise, AZ 85374",9/3/19,2019,9,3

One of the worst companies to work for.,"None of the managers or supervisors were professional. They were all rude, didnt know how to talk to their employees, and favoritism was huge. Not only that, but all of my coworkers were ghetto, nosy, didnt know their place, tried to micromanage, etc. Sometimes they would forget to send you on your lunch or break and even after reminding them they still didnt care. None of the managers even know what theyre doing. The stockers ordered too much inventory and if you were a cashier they wouldnt give a rats a^^ if you had an extremely long line. They would leave you up front all by yourself. I tried moving to a different position and they kept giving me bs excuses about how i wasnt working there long enough when they gave my coworkers the position i wanted while they were only there for 2 months ;^)",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Richardson, TX",9/3/19,2019,9,3

Luck of the draw,"Every store is a little different. Hopefully you get into one without favoritism and maybe you'll get hours and chances to promote.

They don't call that retaliation, but that is exactly what it is._x000D_Turnover is a huge problem, because it's not a company an employee can depend on.

My review summary at Wal-Mart,"My review summary while employed at Wal-Mart was pretty decent they were helpful and understanding for the most part. I got along with my coworkers, the customers, and management. As an unloader I received forty hours a week and got decent pay. As a People Greeter my hours was alot more shorter making my pay very low to the point I couldn't pay my rent in full at times.",3,Former Employee,Unloader Then People Greeter ,"Copperas Cove, TX",9/3/19,2019,9,3

Management is awful!,"When I worked at Walmart the management treated the workers as expendable robots.  If you were injured on the job, they'd allow you to take on a lighter job. Nice. But, if your injury slowed you down and you couldn't get the job done at the speed they wanted, you got fired. Even if the injury was on the job. Some on the management team didn't know what they were doing. They wouldn't listen to you even when you knew more then they did.",2,Former Employee,Remodling Crew Member ,"Albany, OR",9/3/19,2019,9,3
I loved working there and would advise as a first job or of you're in a bind.,"Interview: I waited for about 2 hours before any manager actually talked to me, all the while associates were going back there for me to tell them I was there. They also took about 3 months to review my application and invite me for an interview. The actual interview process was quick, like any other interview. There were 3 different interviews and I was offered the job on the spot. Management doesnt seem to really care about anyone except the company. Coworkers are nice a lot of the time but none of us felt treated fairly so most people did the bare minimum. I got paid a decent wage. I got discounts, but they arent very good for anything and I got paid time off.

Great stepping stone,I wanted to get into the automotive industry and this was the job that allowed me to do so. No other place gave me a chance due to lack of experience. Before I got the job as a technician I tried to apply as a buggy boy or as a stocker. I got denied due to lack of experience. The last time I re-applied I tried to apply as a buggy boy again after 6 years of experience at Winn-Dixie hoping to get on as anything available and TLE Technician just so happened to be assigned to me as a job description.

These were the ""old"" values that Jet use to instill. Now that it has been taken over by Walmart there's been a decline in employee morale. Quantity over Quality is slowly becoming a priority.

The changes in Walmart on controlling inventory through processes has been a great improvement, but the Teamwork Environment needs a lot of improvements.

Management only sees you as a number, EXTREMELY rude and difficult costumers every other transaction, outdated technology, getting time off was a hassle (even for my senior prom!), point-system is really unrealistic (5 points when most people either have families to take care of, health issues you can't even use a doctor's note for, other obligations,etc),  typically expected to do jobs I wasn't trained for, Management takes advantage of us, etc etc.... but this is what really pushed it for me. I had a really good attendance record, but i recently had troubles with my heart. Mind you, I'm 19 and this doesn't typically happen to people my age. I was blacking out and vomiting at work if I was standing up for more than 5 minutes (even in front of a Customer Service Manager who witnessed one of these episodes!) and eventually had a seizure, but all points were counted against me. Department manager cleared my points after i tearfully explained everything that's been happening to me. Asked her about filing for FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act)  and she said she'd take care of it and let me know when we can talk about it, and she never did. Asked her about it AGAIN and she acted like she forgot everything that had happened, and told me I'd need to file for LOA (Leave Of Absence) due to medical, and told me I would need to get with personnel about it (that information was never mentioned in the beginning, but okay.) , So, for 3 days straight, I called multiple times, each with no answer or call backs. I would leave a voicemail - more...",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Lubbock, TX",9/2/19,2019,9,2

The store is very clean and fruits are extra fresh. Freshest meat in town.,5,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Monroe, LA",9/1/19,2019,9,1
It's like being a pinball,"Everyone is out for themselves, none of the managers care what you need to do for your department and will bounce you across the store without asking. Most of the managers themselves do noting but complain stuff while never picking up a box themselves, some aren't bad but at the end of the day they rather cover themselves that help you. The attendance system sucks, they only give you a certain amount of call outs and if you do then you lose your bonus per quarter and on certain days it counts twice. The stores are always understaffed and the front end is a chaotic nightmare. Over all...just save yourself the annoyance an work at any other venue.",1,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Mohegan Lake, NY",9/1/19,2019,9,1

The room for advancement aspect is great asasas wellwell .,5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Independence, KS",9/1/19,2019,9,1
Stressful,"Typical days were slow, but you were expected to work harder than the day required. Hard workers were often given extra loads, and less breaks.

It can be a fun place to work.,It depends on the manager if he or she is fair and is a good leader. Personality is also a factor as well as prejudice and not judging a person on their race and religious beliefs.,3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Saint George, UT",9/1/19,2019,9,1
the hours were low and the pay even lower.,was not given a promised raise in income. the management couldn't care less about the employee. the attendance policy was a joke. if you did not call in a full hour before your shift you would be given a penalty strike. after three strikes you're gone.,2,Former Employee,TLE Technician ,"Payson, UT",9/1/19,2019,9,1
Not worth the managers berating you constantly,"I had a 5 month stint with Walmart as a 'Setup Associate' working to remodel one of their stores. It was not enjoyable.

"Overall, great place to work","Walmart is far from being the ideal workplace. There is much that needs to change both inside the store and up the chain of command. Walmart is undergoing changes that take time to implement. These changes, though not sudden, affect everyone from the first shift to the overnight shift. Their inability to implement these changes in a more efficient manner often leads to confusion and distrust among employees, making it difficult for management to explain it.",5,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Cedar Park, TX",8/31/19,2019,8,31

Overrated,"Walmart is a company only interested in making money. My store's management cared more about their bottom line than customer service, employee moral, fair compensation for work,  or taking care of their employees. I was routinely asked to do work by myself that was supposed to be done by multiple people and would get in trouble if I went over my set hours. Hours were cut during times when we actually needed more people (like holiday prep). There is a lot of favouritism and ageism; employees that were old enough that Walmart got a tax break from employing them don't get written up or fired for things that a younger employee would.",3,Former Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Seguin, TX",8/31/19,2019,8,31
Not my cup of tea,"I don't think that management... corporate, most managers have a hard job dealing with the expectations that are not easily accomplished.

I was terminated due to being sick and calling in every day and sending my Supervisor multiple texts and voice mails.  They moved from 9 days of sick days to 5 while I was out sick.  Nobody called.

Stressful and judgemental.,"Low communication, minimal crew with management and even less of the crew, half of it being drunk call ins. They don't have enough scanners and printers to hand out so we can all be affective. Working us 1 per shift is ridiculous, two people even if its 4 hours in would be better but not because some might wait to work freight until someone arrives. As busy as walmart gets, they honestly need 3 people per shift. One for zone walking and removing what's not ours,2. Work freight and 3, check for customers while all 3 associates switch off. Being one person, I also had dept manager duties as an associate and had to run to the back a lot leaving an empty floor to go get a product that might sell.

Scrambled mess from start to finish,"When you apply to be a Cap 2 Associate it's basically you, and your coworkers, being ridiculed for not doing every job in the store at once. When I worked there I would usually throw the truck for about two and a half hour to four hours only getting a break when the truck is finished being unloaded and sorted. Afterwards, you either go to your assigned aisle to stock, or go to lunch. The lunch period is an hour which very lenient given all the other circumstances. This Walmart in particular is a Supercenter which means that the store has a higher standard to set than other Walmart stores. This does contribute to the high-pace, stressful, and on some days, almost impossible workload for the amount of workers on the Cap team. Management does attempt to assist in said workload from time to time however it is extremely seldom. The stocking in itself is very simplistic since, if you are just starting out, you are paired with someone who has been working for an extended period of time or someone who is quick at stocking. Thankfully, your coworkers will be the best part of the job since most non-management are very entertaining to work with. Finally, the work schedule is quite strange since, even if you request a set schedule you will most likely have to check everyday to see if yours has changed. Unfortunately, several people were fired because of the said mishap. Most of the problems with the store come with the lack of communication that seemed quite unusual since you will be given a set of tasks each day. Overall, the job is extremely hectic and taxing if there is no talking between - more...",2,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Hendersonville, TN",8/31/19,2019,8,31
It's about the oh mighty dollar for Walmart,"Walmart understaffs regularly, but still finds it necessary to cut your hours. Management is horrible. They don't seem to feel the importance to tackle existing issues. They hire many lazy people that need to be babysat.

When necessary asked customer "" Is there anything I can help you with?"" .  Received positive feedback from customers.  Helped those with heavy bags to their automobiles as necessary.  Often, the duties for the day would be stated on that day by management.

Fairly decent place to work and customer interaction is fun.,"Working for Walmart was a great learning experience, especially for socializing. I learned how to talk with people and be more open as customers shared their experiences in life. Management at the Walmart store I worked at was somewhat okay as some days they were fine, but other days were tedious due to miscommunication. Workplace culture at the Walmart I worked at was pretty good as most people had an excellent   work ethic and associates were always willing to help each other to learn and strive for better performance. The hardest part of the job was inventory, preparation for the event to be precise.

Pay wise is very reasonable for the job you do there.  Taking time off from work is not that difficult either.  They care about your well being to an extent.

"Hit or Miss Management skills, Understaffed",When both managers are there assisting the associates the job gets done efficiently with time for cleaning and other related goals. Whenever one or both of the managers aren't at work the productivity of the entire department is strongly affected because the store is already understaffed.

Most Walmart jobs aren't worth it,"There are four kinds of jobs in a Walmart store. Part time employees, pretty much cashiers or cart pushers, work minimum wage and, while they can limit their availability to suit their lifestyle, will have their hours significantly reduced if they do not have open availability. If your availability is open, do not expect a consistent schedule, or to be able to reliably make plans in advance. Full time employees tend to work reasonably consistent shifts and are part of a team, whether it's the sales floor of a particular side of the store, the first stocker shift (5am-2), second shift unloaders/stockers (3pm-12), or the overnight stocking shift (10pm-7). They still work minimum, as a general rule, though they can expect quarterly bonus payouts if they have perfect attendance and the store significantly beats its sales from last year's same quarter and has good customer survey results (up to an unlikely peak of $900, I think. Under $100 is common). Supervisors, like department managers or customer service managers, have an above minimum slot on the payscale and pretty consistent hours (broken weekends still common, though some can consistently work Mon-Fri). Salaried members of management work significantly more hours (50-60ish weekly, easily more during crunch or for Co or Store Managers) and start at about $40k, I believe. All full time employees have to deal with increasing pressures about how quickly they get work done the higher they go._x000D__x000D_The benefits packages do save you money over Marketplace rates, but the coverage is pretty limited.

Ups and downs of working at Walmart,Management talks to the employees like children.  Your hours are cut before bonuses are received on your paycheck. I have learned that you can't make customers or people happy. I enjoy conversations with co-workers and having fun at work.  The workday can be slow at times to the point that you want to go home.

Don’t become an assistant Manager,"there is no work life balance, favoritism in the work place, get scheduled on days i requested off 3-4 months before hand, store manager is rude in their manner of talking to you but if you complain to HR, it goes to the market manager who pretends to care but does not really do anything to hold the store manager accountable. you get scheduled 10 hrs but if you close, be prepared to work 11-14 hour shifts (with no overtime pay of course). Store manager comes and goes as they please including being late and vanishing randomly before their scheduled leave time. if they are scheduled to close, they will instead open and leave you to close by yourself. Store manager sits in their office while you chase fires around the store. Market team cares more about customers then their own employee. within the company, they care more about the morale of hourly associates and could careless about salaried moral (which affects the moral of the whole store). if you make a judgment call for a customer based on store policy and training, and the customer calls corporate, corporate will ALWAYS side with the customer and make you look like you was giving them a hard time for no reason no matter how much you were abiding by company policy. There is so much more but moral of the story is DO NOT BECOME AN ASSISTANT MANAGER AT WALMART UNLESS YOU LOVE WALMART AND ARE READY TO HAVE NO FAMILY/LOVE LIFE! only real benefit is that other companies like to hire former walmart managers because they feel like you can pretty much handle any stressful situation.",1,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,Connecticut,8/27/19,2019,8,27

Not a great place to work anymore,When I first started in 1999 it was a great place to work.  Over the years it has gone down hill by them only worrying about profits.

Management wasn't even aware I walked out because they had completely left me alone on the floor to go chat somewhere else. There is zero concern for employees. They often messed up on bonuses and had to ask them to correct that several times. My self-esteem and mental health dropped dramatically while I was here.

Very pushy work place.,Walmart was not a bad company to work for but they were very old school there. I did more work than most of the people there and I did not get paid what I think I should have got paid. A typical day of work could have me going around to several areas. I hardly ever stayed in one area. I learned a lot about electronics and made several new friends. One thing I can say about Walmart was everyone treated you like family and everyone worked as a team to reach a common goal.,3,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"New Boston, TX",8/27/19,2019,8,27

The store i worked for was just opening up and i think the managers did not have all their ducks in a row. I worked in CAP2, unloading trucks and stocking shelves. One of the requirements is that you have to be able to life 50 lbs or more by your self on occasion. My team consisted of about 10 people on a good day. 5 of which could carry their own weight while the other five were wondering around and could not lift anything.

a learning experience and good people,you would have a meeting at the beginning of the work day and then go to the maintenance area and prepare the machines for that day. sometimes the managers pulled me to go stock shelves when they needed me to. And I loved it. I learned to use a pallet jack and a card board ben and a hand held scanner to locate where an item goes. Sometimes you will have managers that were cool then sometimes they weren't the nicest but that is ok. They are not there to be friends but to get a job well done. The hardest part of the job was some of the other workers there. Sometimes other workers just don't know how to show respect or work ethics and work like a team member to get the job done. I loved working around different kinds of people and learning new things all the time. I like hearing new ideas and knowing how to do things differently.

Even after I explained the situation they still refused to take off the points but instead tried to insist I was ""late"" a few times which also racked up some points. On top of that I worked in the back and they repeatedly stuck me in the truck pushing heavy things up the line FULLY AWARE that I was in my first trimester of pregnancy and was NOT supposed to be pushing, pulling, or carrying heavy items. When I was stacking pallets, a co worker continuously came over to my pallet and kept stacking it wrong and no matter how many times I would explain that it was not me I was still the one who got reprimanded for it. And if all of that wasn't bad enough, as I said they were 100% FULLY AWARE that I was pregnant but yet proceeded to get angry when I needed to take time off for drs appointments for my pregnancy. Years later I discovered I was among a group of people who had similar experiences in totally different Walmart's. I am in no way shape or form trying to bash Walmart because I do shop there but working for them was in my personal experience a nightmare I never want to revisit!

It’s what you make it,"I was excited to work at Walmart. The interview went great. I was given a job offer immediately after. I did have to wait about a month before orientation, which sucked. We basically put all the materials on the shelves and get the store ready by zoning grocery. Easy job right? No! The overnight shift can never keep anybody, which makes work on everyone else even harder. Manager have terrible attitudes and talk to you any kind of way.

"Horrid Management, Overworked Employees","I was doing a managers job in Online Grocery Pickup but getting paid nothing more for it. Was told it may eventually become an actual position where I would make more money than the average grunt man in the department. That was about 8 months ago. I left the company because the managers expected me to do the job to the fullest of my abilities but not get paid anything for it. For 7 months I struggled along and when I asked ""When will I be paid more?"" management kept moving the raise back a few months. Last I heard a coworker who was up for the same raise is going to wait it out. Management told them maybe sometime late spring 2020. A full year after we first started doing the work. A year of not being paid for the work we did.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Fremont, OH",8/23/19,2019,8,23

Fun Workplace with fellow employees,"For some reason there is a bit of drama that goes around in the deli area of Walmart. The energy is usually good, it gets better towards the evening when everyone is more awake. Management definitely needs work and the hours have been very limited.

"Not Bad, Not Great","As a cashier, I tried to keep my head down and just do my job. A typical day at work has you see all sorts of people from rich to poor, nice, rude, bigots, and openhearted people so that was pretty cool because 90% of the time customers were pretty chill. If you get a customer that's being difficult however, management has you bend over backwards to make them happy anyways. Coworkers spend too much time trying to do anything but their jobs. Too much idle time, even the CSM's kind of slack off. Being a student, I needed them to change my schedule often to accommodate my classes. Management had me working full time hours as a part time worker.

No job security basically your just a number.  They are no longer the family oriented.   Just a sad fact.,3,Current Employee,Overnight Walmart Stocker ,"Boonville, MO",8/23/19,2019,8,23
they recognize hard work and promote fairly fast,With in the 8 months I had worked there I have three raises and two promotions . working there was one of the best experiences I have ever had the training is long but has a lot of information,5,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Sacramento, CA",8/23/19,2019,8,23
Not much to look forward too.,Great Place to work if you don't have much to do in life. They require most of your time. You will most likely not a have a set schedule. Management can be great but from my experience that is very rare. Most management does not value the Wal-Mart spirit the company portrays.,3,Current Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Houston, TX",8/23/19,2019,8,23
No long work there,"No longer work there after almost 15 years. I was just shy of my 15 year anniversary when I was told I had complaints so I was terminated. I knew there were a couple because customers are hard to please but most everyone has some. They were making changes and I think they wanted me out of my position, and I couldn't work anywhere else in the store due to accommodation.",1,Former Employee,Fitting Room Associate ,"Mattoon, IL",8/23/19,2019,8,23
Where To Begin,"When I started working for this company 18 years ago, it was great. Amazing, even. Slowly, and as the years progressed,  as the managers changed hands, they made it less about us as a whole, and more about them. Now all these years later, it's all about them, and not about us. Their associates. Seems to have become more of a dictatorship than a retail giant",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Hamburg, NY",8/23/19,2019,8,23

"No structure or communication between co-manager, and store manager to their assistance managers","You get into a job that feeds you to the wolf's, and they pick on you on your first few weeks before you go to class and say why things are not done the way they say it should be, not putting into consideration that stuff that was left from previous management was already a mess and never was taken care of properly when in the time that this company looks for a new associate to take over that department. They make a class for you to learn the rules and still co-manager and store manager does not follow the rules within the class that Associates go to but set up their department managers to fail within their routine and point blame other than themselves to other associates as well as a point the blames to their assistant managers to eliminate the department manager for failure.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Clinton Township, MI",8/22/19,2019,8,22

Chaotic Drama filled work environment.,"Working at Walmart is certainly not the worst possible job, but it isn't great either.

"I liked the duties of the departments and customers, but time for a change.","A typical day consisted of continuous fast paced customer assistance,directing them to items or pulling stock from the back room for them.  I worked in several departments over 18 years.  In Pharmacy I was the over-the -counter help.  In Produce, I stocked the shelves constantly and culled consistently. In Apparel, I folded clothes and stocked from the back room. I learned how much customers relied on an associate's help but the hardest part was trying to do what all the different new managers expected of you, even when they may have disagreed.  I loved helping the customers and seeing all of the ones I got to know over the years. The culture could stand some improvement by showing more respect for the employees.",3,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Portage, IN",8/22/19,2019,8,22

Stable job,"A typical day at work was basically just showing up and doing your assigned duties while interacting with customers and other Associates. I learned how to interact with customers, get my assigned duties done in a timely and effective manner, and how to operate a cash register. Management is very accommodating with my availability so I could go to college full time and they always had an open ear for the things I need to say. The work place culture was very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job where cart pushing is concerned, has to be getting everything done before the end of a closing shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships I have made with my fellow Cart Associates.",4,Current Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Roseville, CA",8/22/19,2019,8,22
Dangerous and ungrateful place to work for,Was victim of an on the job safety issue. Was being harassed by 3 employees one of which carried a gun. Eventually walked of job due to managements refusal to discipline trouble makers and refusal to acknowledge the harassment issue.

No no no,"The money and benefits are good. But the management are awful. They don't talk to you, they talk at you. They don't communicate with one another. They treat you like your going to steal the product. If it's an emergency your family will have a hard time getting in touch with you. They only give you a 15 and a 20 minute break,  and you can not leave the floor until time which cuts into your break time and you have to wait for security to check to make sure you didn't take anything. You have to hurry up and eat and make it back to your station before your 5 minute grace period is up. Any little thing can get you fired.

"Good people, hard workers","Considering it is a retail environment, I couldn't ask for more,  my experience was great, I felt respected as a veteran, as a person._x000D_There were moments of stress during holidays of course, but it was expected, training is not excellent, you have to figure out most of it, and you can only rely on your co-workers at less than 50% of the time, either because they are themselves busy, don't know how to teach you(not everyone can teach despite work experience) and due to their own system of beliefs and education, that is a problem because it could set you up for failure in certain areas, but thanks to my experience from other jobs I was able to relate a pleasant experience to our costumers,  helping them was very satisfactory. I did become very knowledgeable after a while, and our customers were very polite for the most part, then again you must be able to turn a bad experience into a great one for the customer, and I took pride on it.

Fun place to work,"The job is common sense and easy. It can be stressful at times, but usually during the holiday season or during the summer when vacations are taking place. The benefits are great and the management is great to work for and very helpful. For the most part, the customers are a pleasure to help and many of the regulars can make a dreary day brighter.

"Busy during seasons, but overall the job is steady",When I first started working there 5 years ago everything used to be great. The managers and associates would always work together respectfully. Now from what I have heard with some of the associates are that they feel like they are being treated as a number and not like human beings. The associates that I have worked with since the beginning up to now are like family. It was just a lot of things that made me decide to resign from my position.,3,Former Employee,Human Resources Clerk ,"Fort Worth, TX",8/22/19,2019,8,22
Was a great place to work,Walmart has reduced members of management and staff in all locations. Very little time for a family life. Its geared towards a young person who wants the experience of management that has the time to work all holidays and 90 percent of weekends. It's a good stepping stone for an resume for a more work life balance job in the future.,3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Lakewood Ranch, FL",8/22/19,2019,8,22
good retail company,"I enjoyed working for Walmart.  While not everything is fantastic, its not perfect in any retail business, it is a. good business to support a family.

Good work place but its got its flaws,"I took care of customers all the time. I came into contact with many different people. One of the biggest things I learned was they do not have a tolerance for being late, and I also learned how to manage my money.

Terrible Place to Work,"Walmart managers have no idea what they are doing. They send you on breaks too early or too late which ends up sending you back to back for some breaks. They have no benefits for part time anymore. They don’t do paid time off for part time anymore. You can’t exceed 4 points, so if you have a family emergency and can’t trade away your shift, they fire you.

It was a job,"At first I really liked working here. I was at a Super Walmart and started before the store was even opened. I did my online training (3-5 days) and then did some receiving in the back until the store opened and I started as a cashier. You had to be cashier for 6 months and then they decided whether they let you go or put you in a department. I was wanted by three different dept managers so I went with the highest paid dept, which was deli. I liked working in deli for the first year. I worked there about 13 months. After one year, when I was able to and did sign up fro my benefits, everything went downhill. All of a sudden, I was getting in trouble for other being being gross and not cleaning well enough. But I got a write up because I WAS THERE, you know, to do my job. So I was written up for the other girl not cleaning the area she was cleaning (I was cleaning the front and her, the back). Then I got written up for the sandwich case not being full when I had like 30 sandwich orders I had to complete first. It's impossible to do both when you have that many orders. They need a secondary person to do the case on weekends because there's no way. I was told by another associate that our new dept manager (the third I had in 8 months in deli) was told she had to fire someone and that's why the heat was on me as I had just started getting benefits. I'm not one to make excuses. I go and do my job to the best of my abilities always because I have bills! So then one day I came in to make my sandwiches and there's no bread.

Working as a cart pushier,"Your main job will be to provide carts for customers. You will sometimes have to do carry outs & carry ins for customers. (Usually carry outs). It's basically helping customers lift stuffs. You will also do batteries meaning you will have to just transfer the battery from the front end to the back of the store. IMO, doing the batteries are sort of fun. Sometimes, you will have to do some in-store works such as sorting out items or decorating the store but that happens almost never. (once in 1 month). So as i said in the beginning, your main job is to provide carts for customers. My first day was very hard. I was thinking to myself ""Is this the right job for me? This was extremely physically demanding."" But like 3 weeks later, I got used to it and now I have been doing this job for just over 1 year. Honestly, if you are physically fit (If you are not then you WILL get physically fit) then this job will not be a hard job at all. Just make sure to drink store provided ice water & suncreen and you will be fine. You can think of this job as getting paid to work out. I have an app on my phone that lets me know how many steps I have taken over a day and on a busy day, if I work 8 hours shift, I even go upto 35,000steps or about 30km.

The people are nice but...,"My coworkers were nice and sometimes they were like family, but... Overnight is really stressful. I was hired along with another person for the same shift and department and neither of us started working in that department. We each got different departments. He got to be trained in one area and worked in that area everyday, so he had time to catch on. I was put in one department, and then another, and another, and another, so it took me much longer to catch on. Before either of us got past our 3 month probation, he got full-time hours and was able to work overtime dayshift, whereas I was told that I wasn't productive enough to get full-time - even though management said that he was about as productive as I was - and that they didn't like nightshift working in the day when I wanted to work overtime.I believe this happened because I was the topic of some gossip that, I found out later, got pretty far. Nobody told me anything, they just played along and let the gossip spread, which I think was the reason why my hours were reduced and my overtime requests denied.Also, it was difficult stocking the items in the right areas when everything was stocked incorrectly the previous shift, and when I brought this up with management, they said: just stock things in the right area and you can fix whatever's wrong later - but what if entire shelves are stocked wrong?Also, this specific Walmart doesn't have an HR, so it's difficult to bring up anything without one Manager telling me to tell my Managers, or when upper management says ""I'll bring it up with your Managers"" it isn't all too - more...",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Maricopa, AZ",8/20/19,2019,8,20

"Job wasn’t the best, but it got bills paid","Management was very unstable, consistent switching. If you enjoy a heavy work load while your team slacks off and watches you work, this is the place for you. Workers just walk around and barely work, and the managers allow them to do so because they play favoritism. There’s a lot of discrimination, and a lot harassment from the male associates as well. If you report it, more than likely nothing will be done about it, or you will be coached for filing a report. They’ll also have “security” watch and follow you around, and pretend to know nothing of it. Security follows the workers more than customers.

Living to Work,"Since promoting to the ASM position, I have worked in two different  stores and had four different store managers. Both stores have run horribly. During the first few days of Assistant Manager training, it was made clear to all of the trainees that we were all replaceable. Getting into the stores you always carry with you a sense that at any moment you could get coached (and I'm one of the best assistant managers in my store). Credit should be given to Walmart for building a culture in its management team that each and every one of them should be required to work extra days and extra hours daily. Lately the management team has been working 80+ hours a week (which is not uncommon in any given store). Even if you are lucky to get both days off in the week, you will most likely have lame days scheduled off like Monday and Wednesday. Until recently, the potential to promote used to be one of the benefits of this company. In the last 6 months they consolidated the Co-Manager position down to less than half of what it used to be. Good-bye promotion. _x000D_So if you are into working twice the amount of the typical American worker for an average pay, this job/company is for you. The worst part is that the 401k is matched percentage for percentage up to 6% which makes it hard to find another job that offers that. Unless you truly feel that retail management is your calling in life, stay away from this job.",4,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Utah,8/19/19,2019,8,19

"Sometimes great, sometimes bad.","I was never promoted to the position I was promised, so I changed jobs within the company. Then when I switched, my old assistant manager said they were about to give me said position. Once I became pregnant, I moved back to my old job because it was safer for me and my baby, as I had a high risk pregnancy. They denied my requests off so I could go to my doctors appointments. I had lost the raise that I had worked for and was pushed to do more than my body would let me. I was then put on strict bed rest for the remainder of my pregnancy. I had all of my paper work in order and then was denied maternity leave even though I had my baby six weeks prior to my due date. I feel as Walmart and its management team do not care about their employees, just about their sales. It was a great job before I had gotten pregnant since I was about 19 when I started, but after wanting to start a family, it went down hill.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Temecula, CA",8/19/19,2019,8,19

It wasn't too devastating of a job,"The bright side of working in retail is that you learn more about psychology, philology, anthology, and so that can have fun talking about the product there selling by doing your own research, in your own free time. There very few things I would complain about, but it turn out nice to be social and get to know people better, even if you hate people. Furthermore, I would say there's not enough wise boss leaders you can look up to as a mentor. However you'll get to learn new strategies on how to be urgent  during your time shift, which is something they look at often. Lastly, always remember to put your nice jacket and purses locked up in a locker or car, never let anyone you work with know your private good news, you'll never know who's jealous or/and never let anyone know where you live. Always remember to be respectful of others. I know you can't control everything, but never let any toxic people think they hold the key your spiritual and emotional house, that is the problem.

Productive and Competitive,"A job that can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. Each distribution center is different, the one I worked at was very competitive. Everyone tried to one-up each other by working harder and getting higher numbers. The best part about the job was the people I worked with and the managers that were directly above me.

Productive company that serves the community first.,A typical day at work usually starts sweeping the front end of the store and check both inside and out for garbage. I learned how to work with a team and complete various tasks through out the store. The management is fair when we run out of supplies we tell them and they resupply us within two or three business days. The workplace is diverse yet friendly.

Ups and Downs,"The pay is decent for the position (and much higher than many retail pharmacy technician locations). I personally enjoy the fast pace environment. However, the managers often employed at WalMart could use a lesson in humbleness and sympathy. Many of the ones I've encountered are manipulative and demeaning. They will verbally abuse you if they don't get their way. You can file a complaint, but they know how to put on an act and appear to be one of the purest people you could ever meet. Work-life balance is also an issue, depending on where you go. I've had to ignore calls to come in so I could focus on my personal life. At one point, my boss even said they ""didn't need me anyways"" after I told them I couldn't come in.",3,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,Virginia,8/18/19,2019,8,18

Working for Walmart Automotive Care Center,"I work in the ACC area of the store, so change oil, filters, batteries,  tires.  I have learned that Walmart is good place to develop people skills, and work experience. Management tries to make the customers happy as well as we employee's.  We strive to make customers happy, do quality work, then we work on the high speed productivity.   The hardest part of the job is making sure our customers are happy, and making sure we explain to them any issues we may find with their vehicles.

Nice people made you fill like part of the team.,The associates were very nice. The Management team did not work as a team.

Great hours and pay but you give your life away,The pay at Walmart is awesome you get overtime of course you work every holiday you’re never close did you pending on where you’re working but the downside is is they will sleep you constantly and working you are constantly moving and you doing big massive shipment with only one person in my department and it will always be like that every single day it’s always a new shipment and you were the only one that needs to complete that it is hard takes a lot of patience and a lot of dedication you’re going to want to curse scream cry if I yell you name it when you go to work every day it’s so stressful,3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Vancouver, WA",8/18/19,2019,8,18
"Great Company, worse management","This company's management makes or breaks it at store level._x000D_   You can literally have assistant mangers that previously stocked  for 8 years or make Co manager because your SM ""likes"" you. They value popularity over knowledge and performance. This doesn't contribute any kind of growth or development, because there is no emphasis on training or belief in company operating procedures. It can cause conflict with someone that is previously experienced. You're a body to direct vs trained and developed effectively performing your role. The bottom line is the only focus, even if its just for appearance._x000D_  On the other hand you can get into a store with great management that know how important your role is, see opportunities to train and is skilled enough to actually step in and help, you can thrive within the company._x000D_  I wouldn't recommend seeking employment here if you have previous years experience in management, especially in a lesser role.

"Great management, high expectations","The management, especially the supervisors, at Walmart humboldt is amazing, and they do the absolute best job they can. Walmart as a company, has very high expectations and little realistic “testing” of how things should run.

No job security; Corporate Greed (Mid-level and Upper-level management); Pharmacists are just a number (as with any other associate with Walmart),"Don't expect to be appreciated with Walmart. Dedication and loyalty provides no job security with this company. Mid-level management changes are frequent (every 1-2 years) and new District Managers come and go, making drastic changes along the way in an attempt to maximize their own bonus. This pattern of greed seems to trickle down from upper-level management which gives incentive to managers for pressuring people to quit and cutting hours so they can absorb more bonus for themselves. Walmart only strives to squeeze out profit, maximize bonuses for managers, maximize employee turnover to keep pay and PTO payout to a minimum among other corporate tactics. Walmart DOES NOT INVEST in building a better company. Strategies used by management include involuntary hour cuts, reducing shift hours, minimizing staff, setting unrealistic ""expectations,"" and manipulating business and scheduling metrics as a weapon to discipline non-managers. Customers come to Walmart looking for the cheapest out of pocket costs so don't expect a great level of class or respect from them, even towards healthcare professionals like Pharmacists.",2,Former Employee,Pharmacist ,"Las Vegas, NV",8/16/19,2019,8,16

It stole a little more of my soul with every shift.,"Management was very cliquish. They never gave compliments, but they were real quick to tell you how terrible you are then ask you to work harder. They don’t care about your personal life. Walmart comes first. If you cause too many waves in their way of doing things, they cut your hours. God forbid you have to take LOA for something serious, oh like maybe 2 heart attacks. It’s a nightmare working with Sedgwick to keep your job and if you don’t come back to work in an amount of time suitable for them, you will have to defend your job with everything you’ve got. They string you along about promotions and then give it to the ones that kiss the most butt. They do not defend you to customers when doing your job, instead they will undermine you and reprimand you in front of customers. Worst 4 years of my life.",1,Former Employee,"Cashier, Service Desk Associate, CSM ","Hazel Green, AL",8/16/19,2019,8,16

Great company to work for.  The future is very bright.,"From a financial standpoint, the future is very bright for Walmart.  It is like anything else, any other career, you are dependent to a point, on your supervisors to consider your career promotional interests.  I worked for Walmart for 28 years with a stellar performance record.  I brushed up against the wrong person and my support structure crumbled.  My immediate supervisor didn't have the clout to assist or come to my defense when it was needed.  Store managers and higher are under enormous pressure to perform.  Work - life balance is a struggle, with store managers working 6+ days per week to make ends meet.  The pay, from retail standards is very good.  Bonus potentials are incredible.

Learned the difference in Identifications and drivers Licenses (which were fake and which were real).  Management wasn't very knowledgeable or helpful at most times. Walmart is not very employee friendly at times, however they never discriminated again the disabled and that was very nice to see. Hardest part was when customers wanted to speak with the manager and he ignored them and left the employees to handle all situations the best they could.

The location i worked at did not train properly,They just through you into a position and don't follow up with the proper training for the position.

Overall good experience! I would go back to work for them!,"It was a good job with good pay!! Depending on where you live, it’s hard to find someone who pays $11 an hour! I was told electronics gets paid a couple cents more then a cashier does! In order to change your availability you have to fill out a paper and submit into a box before 3 weeks prior to when you actually need your schedule to change ! Which was annoying because the hiring people don’t always look at them til the last minute!!!I was a cashier and after a while of working there it got tiring of having to stay in the same place and not being able to do anything else. You have to wait 6 months to move to any other position, so pick wisely! You have to also wait 3 months to get your employees discount that is 10% which isn’t much! It only benefits you if you spend a 100 or more on something other then food! It doesn’t make sense to me why it doesn’t take as much money off from food but it doesnt, maybe just a couple of cents! But You have 5 points that are taken away if you call in or late. After 5 points they will fire you! But the good thing is , they give you 9mins before you are “considered” late! & now you can use your paid sick days that is given to everyone no matter when you were hired!

Cashier,"Want you to function like a robot. Revolving door of staff.  Management constantly yells at people and rarely see the good in a person job performance.  Give upper management enough duties for up to 3 to 4 people and expected to get done.  Highly stressful.  This creates a moral problem and place is negative environment. Horrible front end management.  Cannot get money to service customers in timely manner.  You cannot do your job efficiently because waiting on money, price checks, price differences, some hostile customers and nobody gets help and do not answer calls for help.   Creates chaos that you have no control over.  This gets scary.  No action taken.  When you want to speak to management it is like speed dating.  You have to get out what you want to say real fast and do not know if listened to because action is rarely taken. Usually on the floor and never an office.  Always a quick discussion. I have been here for awhile and things have changed for the worse.  You can work 40 hours one week and 10 the next.  Not a very good job for income and pay raises are not good.  You all get the same no matter if you are exceptional or poor performer.     Insurance loss due to short hours.  Unless in management the world is not yours.  Management even struggles and creates the negative environment.  When people call out you can work by yourself for up to four hours alone and no help offered or call people in.  That is a lot of people to service by self and constantly yelled at for things the cashier has no control over.

Working for Walmart,Customer service is a priority and the main part of every job there.  Walmart taught me how to use a telxion to perform inventory functions.  No leadership whatsoever from department to store level.  Communication from management to workers is horrible and at most times non-existing.  Workplace culture is not balances for all shifts.

Management is different everywhere you go,I loved it at first going to get my things put them up. Unloading pallets until the truck is done unloaded it was all fine. Then a manager wont stop harassing me about how my performance wasnt satisfactory and saying i dissapeared sometimes. So i quit because of the disrespect and didnt want him to fire me and make me look bad.

Busy and unappreciated,"Most days working at Walmart will start with a general walk through of your department to see what needs to be taken care of; whether it's freight from the night before or house keeping for the day that's been started. Throughout the day there'll be customers that need help with a myriad of problems and honestly, you'll only be able to help with about half of them. A lot of the time you will be expected to take care of your specific department and the 2 or 3 departments neighboring yours, depending on the location you work at and depending on the managers. It will teach you about prioritizing certain tasks over others, and it will teach you a lot about general social interaction if you happen to struggle. Management at the particular Walmart I worked at was, to be honest, pretty abrasive. The manager I worked under was more focused on delegating than helping and were quick to put you down in front of customers. Higher management did try to foster a feeling of belonging to a team, but most of us knew it was just a job that we more or less ended up at. The hardest part of the job was, at least in my case, dealing with the management rather than the customers. The most enjoyable part was actually getting to feel like a customer appreciated your help and that you did something to make their life a little more convenient.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate and Cashier ,"Radcliff, KY",8/15/19,2019,8,15

Almost perfect job.,I personally loved working at Walmart. I was in garden center and was also doing cashiering up front and also stocking the fresh produce. I only left because my hours were dropping and I had bill to pay and wasn’t going to be making them if I was off for a week straight. Walmart should be able to give more hours and people would stay.,4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Leitchfield, KY",8/15/19,2019,8,15
"Great work place, friendly staff , excellent workers","It was a great work place , helped me obtain skills like communication , working on the register , working with a group of people. overall the experience was good and everyone was friendly. A typical day at work was making sure customers got what they needed and rang up there products.",5,Former Employee,cashier ,"Manahawkin, NJ",8/15/19,2019,8,15
Easy Job,"The Job itself was very simple. I came in every morning, scan the bins, take whatever beeps onto the sales floor to be stocked, and that's it. What made the job difficult was management was always very stressed and would not communicate to one another. If the shift before you didn't finish what they were supposed to do then you had to do it plus get what you were supposed to get done finished. However, if you weren't able to do what they left and your stuff you got blamed and yelled at. The customers were the best thing about the job.",3,Former Employee,Cap 1 Associate ,"Rockford, IL",8/15/19,2019,8,15
Is a good place to work for a first job,"I worked for Walmart for about 5-1/2 years and was never treated well. No matter how hard you worked, it was never enough. Even though it was against store policy, there was a lot of favoritism. They would ask you to work overtime and then before the end of the pay period would force you to cut your overtime.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Reno, NV",8/15/19,2019,8,15

"Good Pay, Not worth it",When I got hired I was made to feel like it was a family oriented business. It's the opposite. The production is almost impossible to make because you are dependent on drivers to get your freight. The managers are unprofessional and only care about a number and not quality. The pay was good but it's ok if you can deal with feeling like you're on a plantation everyday.,2,Former Employee,Processor ,"Hope Mills, NC",8/15/19,2019,8,15

busy work environment and always work to do so always hiring,Walmart is a big corporation and being part of that is very exciting but not so much the part where you get constantly disrespected by rude customers.

Only good thing is the money,"They hire you work you to death and then fire you.

My job At Wal-Mart,I was in a rare situation I guess because I loved working for Wal-Mart. They were always very respectful with numerous opportunities.

It’s okay if you are looking for experience,"Nothing to tell thank you, a job is a job. If you are looking for a job for experience they will Hire you no matter no experience what so ever. Noting enjoyable about it. Management expect more but they are okay. Noting hard just heavy work",1,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"San Leandro, CA",8/15/19,2019,8,15
Department Managers run the ship,"As a sales associate it was fast paced but not very stressful and easy to accomplish assignments.  Being promoted in less than 6 months with no training and during the holiday season made things very challenging.  I didn't get properly trained as a department manager until in the position 5 months.  The online training was decent, but poorly assigned for the job codes.  I learned more about the CAP process and the registers when taking CAP training that would have been very helpful as a sales associate and department manager...but it was too late.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Holly Springs, GA",8/15/19,2019,8,15

Competitive pay for non-degree candidates,Wal Mart would be a better place to work without so many ineffective work policies. It does offer decent pay for those with only a high school education. It also provides you with plenty of customer service experiences.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cynthiana, KY",8/15/19,2019,8,15
Cashier | Service Desk,"Never work here, make you come to work sick and may not send you home, making healthy people at risk for getting sick. No opportunity for full time, they work you just the minimum number of weeks to earn full time hours and then cut your hours so they don't have to make you full time.

Quite the learning experience of what should Not be done but knowledge can be gained regarding how retail business works.,"Management is not on the same page, lack of communication between all managers and associates, frequently changes work schedules without consulting associate, does not hold people accountable, managers do not treat all associates fairly across the board, some managers show no respect for the associates, managers don't like it if you call off because you are sick or have an emergency, managers only concerned with the numbers at the end of the day. No uniformed organization, changes occur frequently and without everyone knowing of the changes. Managers have scolded associates out on salesfloor, in front of co-workers and customers.

Walmart in a Nutshell,Stressful and fast paced environment focused more on meeting metrics and goals or padding the numbers than customer experience and customer quality.

Company was fair but management and coworkers were not.,"The pay was as expected from a big company as well as benefits after three months of employment. There were many other employees during a shift so pressure was minimal. If someone finished stocking their designated aisles, they would go help another employee. However, after awhile of being one of the top employees of my shift others talked about me behind my back to the managers and in turn management singled me out for minute mistakes and I quickly gained multiple marks on my record all of which was uncalled for and as others were much worse than myself.

Friendly and co-operative workers and managers make for a good day.,"The store has a culture of friendliness.  The supervisors even phrase their orders as requests. --- ""When you finish what you are working on, please clean the glass in the jewelry cases.""  Workers help cover adjacent areas when needed. For example, I learned to run the paint mixer in the hardware department and the key cutter in the automotive department.  A down-side of this is that the store  frequently is understaffed--it is not unusual for the schedule to provide only one sales associate to cover two areas.       For me, the hardest part of the job was what they called ""zoning.""  (Straightening up the stock, fronting items, etc.  At 2 PM they called almost all the sales associates to zone groceries.  I found this difficult because the cans and jars are packed so tightly that there is danger of knocking things off the shelf.

Interesting Place to work.,"It's been an interesting place to work. You meet very little happy employees working for Walmart unless they have been there for a couple of years or more.

STILL waiting on the call to see how I am after losing job to restructure. The reddit reviews you see actually are real, they just start out in another part of the country.

"Poor company culture, no leadership","Ineffective and inexperienced managers. Management does not stay on the  company programs. This problem is company wide. There is a huge focus on minimum inventory levels to save money company wide. Because management does not adhere to programs the result is constant out of stocks and upset customers!!! The company culture knows the customer will be inconvenienced but believes they will learn to deal with it!! Anyone trying to run the programs correctly is ridiculed--I was a trainer and experienced this first hand!! As a result , employee moral is always low. Daily pep talks are the norm .  Compensation, --time off--insurance--sick time are near competitive but always changing. Usually the employee gets the short end of the stick when there is a change.   Bottom line===NO leadership at store levels, poor company culture,terrible customer service. If you are a "" YES MAN""  this is the job for you. I did meet many people from all walks of life. My daily interaction with them made the job tolerable. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing people under my supervision get promoted!

Great as a first job,"In my experience of working with Walmart I dealt with inconsistent working hours, high stress work shifts with minimal to no help, and shift work out in extreme weather without much compensation.

Overall good starter job,"There are lots of benefits to Walmart, but I think the hourly wage could be higher especially with specialized positions such as those in automotive. I started out as a cashier, then became a customer service associate, and then an automotive service desk writer. For positions such as in automotive as a service writer or technician, they should be definitely being paying higher than $11 an hour you make as a cashier. I've received 3 raises throughout my 3 years there and it used to start at $9 an hour, but now starts at $11 an hour. A typical day is pretty high-paced and it involves a lot of customer service skills no matter what position you are in. It can be stressful, but managers and coworkers there were always friendly and helpful. If you're newer there a lot of older employees such as myself they would more than likely be willing to lend a hand. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely talking to regular customers. I think it's a really good place to work unfortunately with student loans and trying to move into my own apartment I'm not making enough money to live off of and I feel like the automotive dep, in general, are not paid enough for their hard work. All the managers were awesome!",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Palmyra, PA",8/13/19,2019,8,13
