Productive and busy place to work.,A typical day is to go to the back grab a cart then go to the fitting room to get returns.  Start at one end of the department straightening it up putting away returns.  Help with phone coverage.

I help customers and put out freight.  _x000D_My co-workers and I get along for the most part and we work as a team to get things done.  We go to management if we need more help.  The hardest part of the job is when you have the 5 lines and the radio and assisting customers into the fitting room all at the same time.  Enough to drive any one crazy.  The most enjoyable part of the day is when you get to talk with the customers.  They help make the day go by faster.,3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",11/21/13,2013,11,21
Working at Walmart,"On the regular days at work I am always taking care of customers and cooking and washing dishes was always a necessity. I learned that the more you keep yourself and area clean and talk to the customers more appropriately the more recognition and respect you earn.  Respect goes along way.  So the more respect the less bad days.  The hardest part about working at walmart was dealing with ignorant people- employee or customer. Its not fair being on the clock and you have to keep everything professional in order and ignorance comes along. The best part was being able to work and laugh and the same time, and making customers laugh as well",4,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Cairo, GA",11/21/13,2013,11,21

A perfect job for a student,"I went through a couple jobs before I found this perfect job. I wanted to further my education. I realized that not everyone respects that. Walmart has helped me to further my education by giving me a stable and flexible job in their deli. They worked around my school schedule. They let me leave early to study for my exit exams, they let me change my availability when my school schedule changed, and most of all, they understood when I came into work exhausted from going to school and work back-to-back. I am really grateful for Walmart being there when I really needed them. A typical day for me started at 8am. I got up, got ready, and headed to work. I had a 37 minute drive ahead of me. When I got there at 9am, I would say hello to my manager, and we would talk about anything that happened the day before; good or bad, Then I would go into the freezer and get all the food that needs to be cooked for that day. At the end of the day, I would feel accomplished. I made all the food, and the rotisserie chickens for that day. I cleaned the ovens, started the dishes, and then went to clock out. My co-workers are hard workers. We had the most tasks in the morning, then the other shifts do. We worked as a team to get everything done in a timely matter. The best part about this job is the customers. I enjoyed talking to them and getting their orders ready. The hardest part of the job is the stress. It wasn't easy some days. If someone called in, we picked up the slack. I didn't mind having extra on my plate, but it would make my manager stressed out, which in return stressed us out too. - more...",5,Current Employee,Deli Clerk ,"Corpus Christi, TX",11/21/13,2013,11,21

A job not a career,"Besides being under paid for the work assisgned by management. Walmart is a job. The benefits are unhelpful.

Very productive environment,A typical day at Walmart is satisfying the customers and getting ones assigned task completed. I've learned that alot of things can be handled by cooperating with a customer instead of going straight to management when a difficult situation come in to play. The management here is very willing and time driven. They make sure that things are done in an orderly manner. One of the hardest part of the job for me is speaking up and suggesting new ideas.

Another day at Customer Service,"A typical day of work at Walmart is truly a lesson in patience and flexibility. It is being mindful that all the customers are different and their needs are too, that some have bad days, some have disabilities, some are coming from the hospital just down the road, some dishonest, and some wish you a good day and will pray for you that evening at supper. Your breaks will be early by 30 minutes, or will be overlooked entirely. The store manager is wonderful. When you have a question or do not believe you are being given a fair shake, he is a common sense man who will sit down and listen to you. Walmart is extremely lucky to have him. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is also the customers. Asking how they are preparing the groceries they are purchasing, hearing stories of who they are inviting over for supper, or how their grandchildren are picky eaters are the parts of my work day that make me smile.",3,Current Employee,Front End Cashier ,"Rockford, IL",11/20/13,2013,11,20

"Da Receiving Processor & RSR Lift Driver DC7034 Smyrna,De Sept 11th 2012-Oct 2013","You get to your department and have your daily start-up meeting. Stretch then your off to the races. They always have ""GOALS"" that you need to meet but NEVER enough Unloaders hooking you up with good freight. They always bring you hard to process pallets or pallets you have to look up that take valuable time away from your production standards they keep you on. In DA receiving they have been through 3 manager changes and multiple associates since my 7 months there. I later transferred to RSR B1 and they are even worse. They show you a few things and then send you on your way. This building doesn't tell you that you are not meeting production goals until its time for you to sign off for that Step. Since my time there they have had a GM & A HR manager quit and they fired a HR manager with 13 years under her belt for some BS. The new school of Managers and GMs that they have there now are out to ""Clean House"". They are not trying to better this place, they are making it worse. They do not value overtime nor do they appreciate it. It's all about production per hour there. You're expected to make it even though you do not have the materials to make it.

Only good as a last resort kind of job.,Walmart was very assumptive of what people were doing and never followed through with actual investigation of employee actions being taken to keep up or correcting mistakes. Management was often hard to work with and usually very unreasonable. Hours fluctuate constantly and they went through employees as though they were nothing. You never quite get recognition for jobs done to an exceptional level as long as something is being done. The pay is low for the labor they expect under the frequent stressful situations they put you through. Other employees tend to make it harder for you to do your job efficiently.

To properly scan it in and out of the bins also do Bin audits as well as palletize and operate the stacker,and to use pallet jacks.The hardest part of the job was to know that you were overworked and under paid.

Life as a cashier,"A typical day consisted of working with my team to provide the best experience for customers. I loved my co-workers and our management. I enjoyed helping and interacting with the customers. The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy every customer's need.

I have been with the company for 16 years overall and there are plenty of opportunities to advance.,"Every day at Wal-Mart is a challenge.  We are merchandising for upcoming holidays and local events.  We react to notes through conference calls on a daily basis and to playbook updates.  We have to check our emails for recalls and up to the minute changes.  We are responsible for our areas and our payroll and staffing.  I enjoy interacating with my associates as well as with our customers.  I work well with my associates and I have some great associates that are willing to go the distance with me on any given project.  The hardest part of the job is maintaining adequate staffing with so many jobs in our area paying considerably higher wages.  Through working with my associates my turnover is lower than the rest of the areas but I still hold my associates accountable.  I think that the most enjoyable part of my position is the interaction with my associates as well as with our customers because so many of them are in the store on a regular basis and you get to know them.  I have learned alot about the retail business and I have supervised up to 300 associates over the years.  I have learned to run the operations end of the business and I have managed every area in the store.  I do my own hiring, coaching for improvement, I manage the freight flow in my areas as well as the associates.  I pull the P-n-Ls from my areas to cover them with my department managers so they know where the areas of opportunity are.",4,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Flour Bluff, TX",11/18/13,2013,11,18

Nice place to get started,"I was nineteen when I worked for Wal-Mart. The managers were helpful, not too intense. The co-workers were friendly and very welcoming to me when I first arrived. The hardest part of the job is when everyone that works with you in your department called in except you. You would be responsible for everything in that particular department unless management brings someone over from another department to lend you assistance. The most enjoyable part of a job is clocking out, and going home knowing that all the hard work that you did for the day, payed off.",4,Current Employee,Store Clerk ,"McKinney, TX",11/18/13,2013,11,18

"Productive workplace with low pay. The benefits are good, and there's opportunity for OT. The bonuses are a plus!","A typical day for me consists of walking around the backroom and picking the merchandise that needs to be stocked. This includes lifting heavy items, climbing the ladder, and using power equipment. Then, it gets loaded onto a cart or a pallet so it can be pulled out to be stocked. Using the same techniques, I put the over stock away. The hardest part is climbing up/down the ladder with heavy items. I enjoy the fast-paced environment and always being busy. I don't see many co-workers due to being in the backroom, but we would crack jokes and play games at lunch time. There's many managers, and they have ups/downs like everyone else.

A day's work,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consisted of Baking bread starting at 5am. While the bread was in the oven, I did mark-downs for the day and thru out the old stuff. After done baking, I would package and put it out on the floor to buy. After all done, I would run product out on the floor when needed. I loved working with the co-workers there.

I was often acknowledged on how well my attitude and job performance was while working or just visiting the store on my personal time. There really was not any hard task on the job but if I must say it was trying to keep a clean station after customers repeatedly put merchandise in wrong places but I didn't mind taking up the responsibility.

"Fast pace, productive work environment","In the nine years I have worked as an overnight stocker, I have learned different areas of customer service as well as the importance of learning all one can learn about the company and the different positions available within the company. Management has shown great appreciation for employees who show initiative and willingness to move from one task to another. In the retail industry, co-workers are not just others who work for the company. Co-workers are team members who must work together to stock merchandise and meet customer demands. The hardest part for an overnight stocker is working to get merchandise stock during high volume times.

Stay Away,"The associates are awesome. As an assistant store manager at Walmart, I liked to interact with my associates.  I also had a great schedule of 3 days on and 3 days off.  But, sadly, these were the only good characteristics of my position.  I spent most of my 12 hour days sprinting across the salesfloor fighting fires.  We were terribly understaffed.  I often ran a cash register, stocked shelves, zoned, cleaned up spills, collected shopping carts, sold hunting licenses, and carried heavy merchandise out to customers' vehicles.  I came to truly understand the real cost behind the low prices.  We (all employees in the store) were overworked, under paid and led to believe we would get a bonus called ""My Share.""  Well, I never got a bonus.  This is because of all the ""shrink"" our store managed to acquire.  Shrink meaning the loss of profits due to theft and accidents.  As a manager, I was told to give my associates more work than they could possibly accomplish in one day.  And in turn, my shift managers and store manager overloaded myself.  _x000D_  The irony of my job was that I wasn't even a manager. I mean that I didn't have time to manage.  At our 8:00 Am meeting with the store manager, we would get a list of action items called ""notes.""  These were usually problems that she found on the salesfloor or in the backroom.  As assistant managers, we needed to delegate these notes to lower level managers and associates to complete by day's end.  These notes were usually about 20 to 50 items.  As I've mentioned, there weren't many associates on the salesfloor so I usually ended up doing half - more...",1,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Klamath Falls, OR",11/17/13,2013,11,17

I learned a lot about different types of plants and the things they need to survive. My managers where not that great they didn't do their jobs well ill just say that. My co workers where awesome.

There are many levels of management that work side by side with each other and makes sure the store is up to par with what standards are for Walmart. The hardest part of the job, is to maintain and balance the time we are tasked and expected to start and finish a job. In order to accomplish a goal, time management is the key.

The drawback is that Walmart doesn't like to pay you much, I made a bit better than minimum wage. You get to watch an extremely anti-union message during your orientation and let me tell you, DO NOT talk about unions with any positive air. If you are young (have the time to wait), and can deal with the low pay, there are places to grow within Walmart But I am older and don't have the time to wait It is, by far, the best low-pay job you can get, so get on here before places like McDonalds or other fast-food joints.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,South Carolina,11/15/13,2013,11,15

Experienced Alot,"I began as a back-up cashier over in the Lawn and Garden Department at Wal-Mart. The management team saw that I was a fast learner, easy going, and possed great communication skills. I was the only one out of the new hirees that, earned my forklift licence within two months, was picked to gain more control and experience of the other departments in the store, and was on schedule for 37 hours a week. Typically, a new hiree would only get 28-33 hours a week and would have that many hours until they were made permanent with the company. The aim was to get more hours, more training and experience; I was hungry for the work. I couldn't wait to get to work so I could do better than the day before. My customers loved me. I developed great conversations with them and they depended on me. At times, I felt like I was the manager. I learned so much. I became a plant specialist also. I am a multi-tasker and that's one of the reasons why I stood out the most. I miss working there. Some were sad to see me go, but my kids were more important. My roomate/sitter left unexpectedly and it caused me to quit. I tried getting a hardship transfer but i wasn't at my 6 month mark yet. Because I'm new to Atlanta, I didn't have family or friends to sit for my kids, nor did have make enough income for a daycare. I learned that it's OK to be myself and that alone shows confidence.

I did not mind this at all and was actually pretty excited to show what I am capable of but things were very short-lived with my motivation towards the idea. At first I was able to properly work in my departments and start moving things in a positive direction but my Store Manager, being new to our store, started loading a lot of different tasks on my co-workers and I. This was not much of a problem because the things we were asked (enforced) to do were just part of our jobs in helping out each-other as a team usually would. We would do things like work pallets of merchandise for another department that had excess freight from our truck we received the previous night because there wasn't enough help during the night-shift & we would also, from time to time, have to help out with the zone and front-face the products on the shelves to help give a clean and friendly appearance to the customers. The REAL problem is the fact that just recently, us department managers were told that the only time we are allowed to our selves is in the morning when we come in at 7am then from 9-9:30am onwards we were to do whatever needs to be done for the store as a whole.

Productive work place with opportunities to grow in company,"A typical work day at walmart depends on the area in which you are hired for. Theres the floor associates who zone, unload trucks, stock shelves, assist customers, and pretty much have a designated area they are responsible for but can be pulled wherever they are needed. Cashiers are in a way an area all in theyr own, they rotate from register to register and can be pulled onto the floor for extra help. Then theres the pharmacy, vision center, wireless, photo lab and TLE. Each area has a set list of notes they are responsible for completing each day while providing excellent customer service. I've learned patience, time management, customer service, problem solving and much much more from the years I've been with the company. Depending on the day and time of year can reflect of co-workers, for the most part we're all here for the same reason and everyone seems to work well together in order to make each day an enjoyable work enviornment. Our store inparticularly seems to be able to improve in the management area. There are great managers that are eager to help and do everything they can to provide help but others sometimes seem to just do the bare minimum to keep they'r title.

We all love to shop at Walmart, but being an employee is a completely different story. On the downside, I never even knew what an anxiety attack was until I worked for Walmart. After standing on your feet all day, breaks were not long enough. Not being allowed to use the bathroom when you need to go & when you finally get a mangers attention, they take hours just to get someone to cover you for a restroom break.

Fun Place to work,"Great Associates, opportunity for advancement if you are willing to work hard.  Management is great and readily available to assist when necessary.  The hardest part of the job is not feeling defeated by customers when they become agitated or angry with customer service.  This does happen quite often and can make someone feel overwhelmed at times.  The key is to understanding that there are circumstances beyond customer service that may be causing the initial onset of anger and to try to ease that frustration by giving it your best in quality of customer service.  Most times, bad customer service reflects more than the present situation in the customers life.  We must always exceed their expectations when it seems they are having a ""bad day"".

My Experience,"I have gained five years of customer service experience while working at Wal-mart. Most of my experience at Wal-Mart is through cashiering. I was also trained in the key- making, fish licensing, customer service, overnight stocking and backroom inventory departments. Wal-mart is a work place that definitely provides different scenarios pertaining to customer related issues. The biggest problem I encountered was management and lack thereof. Manangers are supposed to be appointed leaders that show diplomacy, respect and support for the employees of the company. In my experience there would be one to two managers to demonstrate these efforts. Wal-Mart is infamously known for catering to ""family needs"". Wal-mart is too big of an establishment to lack management with proper managerial skills.Management does not emphasize the importance of teamwork and support to one another. In instances such as these it results in rapid levels of diminution in success of large projects and especially the morale of their workers. Suggestions were made pertaining to methods of enhancement but the management failed to apply or even take them into consideration.Granted everyone has experienced favoritism at their workplace whether it was through them or a co-workers but if the favoritism degree becomes so extreme it nearly cause the whole operation to implode the clever idea would be to evaluate the virtuous employees from the corrupt employees. I would what I enjoyed most about working at Wal-Mart is the rapid pace it required especially during the first half of the month as well as the holidays.

Never a dull moment,"Everyday was different and I met all kinds of people from all around the world. I learned a lot from customer service, piercing ears, and learning the merchandise in my department. Management would constantly stop and chat and watch as I was waiting on customers. At first it made me nervous, but then when I asked a management about it one day his response was the evaluation was coming up and he was checking to see how I provided customer service and if the customer was happy. I had great coworker and we worked well as a team to get everything done that needed to be done that day plus more. The hardest part was to please every customer that walked through the door and with working in jewelry there were certain watches we could not replace batteries for, not because ewe did not have the batteries, but because the watch was very expensive and if the watch broke in the process it would cost the store to repair the watch.

"Great benifits, job security","Wal-Mart is a great job to begin with, they're very flexible with you as you may find yourself being with them. I say this because one thing I loved about wal-mart was how well management worked with me and/or around my being pregnant. It was nice working at such a facility because when I wasn't able to work in one department anymore due to restrictions (whether they be weight or just standing/exercise in general) it was easy to work around because there were so many other departments I could be worked in to that may not of interfered with those restrictions at all. Though on the same hand, one thing I never grew to like was the always changing unpredictable hours/schedule when working on the sales floor. Granted it was I who was always the one willing and agreeing to pick up extra hours or shifts to help my managers as I was young with not many responsibilities yet and always in need of a bigger paycheck. (There may have been no family yet to support, but bills always needed paid.)_x000D_I will say it was depressing only getting a 40 cent raise each year as it seemed it would take a century before I could afford to really be able to support for my future family when having to start at minimum wage. But at the time, I did love the job security in the sense that wal-marts are located literally all over so if ever for any reason my family and I needed to move, losing my job wouldn't be an issue. I also absolutely loved all the benefits wal-mart was able to provide such as insurance, vacation, stock, and memberships such as Sam's Club._x000D_I never felt co-workers or management were an - more...",4,Former Employee,"Inventory Associate, Sales Associate, Cashier ","Indianola, IA, Altoona, IA",10/28/13,2013,10,28

A day for me at WM is managing three depts which im still learning more each day. Management is fair, and informational when teaching us on how to run our depts.

I enjoyed retail and working with the public.,"I generally worked a six to eight hour day with two breaks and an hour lunch.  In the first year I worked in the Health and Beauty department.  The most important thing was good customer service.  If a customer needed help any where in the store it was our job to assist them, not just in our department. This is always important to both the company and the store.  It is the right thing to do for the customer by making them feel welcome and important.  I further worked in the Craft and Fabric department.  I enjoy crafts and sewing;so this fit very well with me.  I learned scanning, zoning, department resets, ordering and how to manage a department. I filled in when the department manager was gone.  I like people and work well with others.  I also worked to resolve any conflicts as soon as they came up.  I had a lot of good relationships with co-works.  Management changed quite often so we had to get used to a lot of different personalities.  Some were difficult and some were a joy to work with.  Just having enough time in the day to get eveything done and do good customer service.  I enjoyed helping people find what they needed.

Good Job security but lacking compensation and management,"Walmart offers good job security and a fairly flexible schedule.

Sometimes employees are forced to work in departments that pay more to the regular employees of those departments.  But to balance the budget those normal employees of sad departments have their hours cut and lower compensated individuals are required to work in those departments and half of the time.  Also management lacks the ability to communicate with each other.  Some managers seem o have little to know idea about how to manage while others seem to know exactly what they are doing.

I also worked with Department Heads to get the merchandise out on the floor.  The invoicing clerk taught me how to enter unidentified products into the computer system.

It is very demanding and what makes it worse is you have over 5 managers that act like sharks constantly putting you on new tasks for the most part of your day... When they tell you to do something, you better get on it fast and work, or they will start to eyeball you... Most of the time, I have little time to slack off... Bathroom breaks, sitting breaks, ect.... you get the point... If you work for Walmart, stay out of grocery because you will have more than one boss that will be setting you to a task every 30 min to an hour... The worst part about the position I am in is that  they time me... When they give me a task, they say "" you have 20 min to complete this task"". Half the time I think they are joking, but thy are not... I learned this the hard way... It is not a chill job... Everyday I have to work hard for them or risk getting a warning for not being up to pare... It is really hard sometimes, even when I am at full speed, and doing great, no one notices my hard work to say ""good job""...I think they are targeting me because I made school my first priority and made Walmart second due to my availability.... they tell me that sense I have experience from my other job that I should work faster and better than the other two guys in my department... They tell me that they expect - more...",4,Current Employee,Grocery Stocker ,"Toccoa, GA",10/26/13,2013,10,26

Good company with some downs,A typical day at work includes putting out stock and helping costumers find the items that they were looking for. I learned how to best aid costumers in finding the items they needed. For the most part the management was good except for the lack of communication between them. The co-workers were very helpful and fun to work with for the most part. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the bad costumers.

Decent job with Decent Pay,"During my time involved with Wal-Mart, the job came as part of my daily routine.  I went to work at 4, started unloading a truck, went to lunch when it was finished, then hauled all the freight to the proper departments.  My team was a group of amazing guys, always willing to lend a hand.  As for the ""management"", and I use this term lightly, they were less than helpful in any way, shape, or form.  I did develop a keen sense for memorization while working with the company, and improved on my physical strength.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with a member of the management team who refused to do anything, and was always complaining about something, regardless of the day.  The most enjoyable part?  I would have to say meeting the team that I got to work with, and spending time around them.

When management was approached with the details, they often didn't respond or handed the problem out to another manager which did not help us associates. the pay in my opinion could have been better, i worked there two and a half years and was being paid what most people start with.schedules were a nightmare and when i asked for Sunday off for church i was told too many people lie about attending church and too many already have it off, i didn't think they were allowed to do that but i guess so,  overall i worked really hard to figure no one above my position really cared.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Saginaw, TX",10/24/13,2013,10,24

At ten p.m. I have a meeting with all the associates and tell them what is expected of the evening.

Retail,A typical day at work included assisting customers in the fabrics and crafts department.  This included helping the customer find what they needed and restocking shelves.  At this job I learned how to measure and cut fabric and how to better assist customers by taking the time to listen to their issue and work with them to determine the best possible solution that would be satisfactory.

I enjoyed work when i first started then i only enjoyed my fellow friends/employees,"When I first began in 2006 I was hired full-time,benefits were good,we had work incentive bonuses and management was very kind and cared about me as an employee and person. Thru the years hours were cut, bonuses and incentives were taken away, I had to take a leave of absence due to having cancer and on the date I was to return I had to have reconstructive surgery and needed a few more weeks leave of absence due to the fact I could not put the surgery off. I was told if I missed even one day upon my return I would be fired. I was also told that even though I was a full-time employee that upon my return I would be part-time and now you don't work in one department you never know where you will work so in my opinion that makes it difficult for anyone to become proficient at their job it also is not fair to be paid a lower rate for a job that should be paid more. After the hours and bonuses went away the only thing I enjoyed about my job was seeing my friends. I still get a good reference from there b/c I did my job plus my department managers job for a very long time and they knew I was one of their best. That was another thing I didn't like was while my department manager was out on medical leave for 6-8 weeks I did her job..everything she did I took over but instead of temporarily moving me up to that pay rate during her absence they kept me at my basic sales associate pay rate but doing the job of a department manager. I was commended by managers and customers for my excellent customer service on more than one occasion..that was the other thing I enjoyed about that job, working - more...",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Eastland, TX",10/22/13,2013,10,22

Other areas while busy tend to be left with little or no help to the associate(s) in that department. I learned a lot of detailed work within the Money Center that led me to feel quite independent even with numerous clients at one time. I have worked with some really great co-workers in the Money Center and assisted training others who caught on well. The hardest part of this job was sometimes being over loaded with a room full of clients waiting .

"Overall great place, so long as you don't have to deal with upper mngt or home office.","I love working in public with people and you certainly get plenty of that here. When I started with this company in 2009, it was almost perfect. Everyone was friendly and always willing to help each other. _x000D_ However, as with every large work place there were still plenty of rumors and a few associates who would become jealous and take credit for what you accomplished if you weren't careful. These are easy to get past. _x000D_ In my last year there, nearly all of the upper management had been replaced. Most of these new managers are rude, insensitive, and careless._x000D_ I'm a single parent with a child who has a bladder condition I had then just noticed. During the months of testing and out of town appointments to see specialists, I would inform my manager of the dates I would need off, and even putting it into the electronic system, nearly a month in advance. I would be told they would take care of it. However when that weeks schedule would come out I would be on to work that day. Repeatedly I would go to my manager first who would then send me off to another because he/she was otherwise busy, and in turn would be sent see another manager continuing a cycle. I would become beyond frustrated. Eventually getting with my immediate department manager, not someone who can change it but take any responsibility for me switching with another associate in my area to have that day off. _x000D_  Unknowing at the time, it was being counted against me.

Bad hours and managers are a Joke.,Working at Walmart is some place you only gain experience from. A typical day at work for the most part is you are constantly doing something your schedule on the day to day basis is never the same managers will ask you to do something in a tone of voice like you are looked down upon some will walk right past you and won't even speak but when they need you to do something they will get on their walkie and say tell such and such to do this or that right after they walked past you. The reason I stayed so long was because of the people I come in contact with meaning the customers and the associates that work side by side myself. The hardest part was to reframe myself from totally just losing my head although most of the customers I come in contact with are a pleasure to be around you still had some that come and can make your whole day go bad and then when you go and get a manager they side with customer telling you their right after the customer then called you everything but the child of God.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Sterling Heights, MI",10/21/13,2013,10,21

When i first started the store was in the middle of remodel. I had got hired as Store Set-up, and got the chance to learn about all the setup  of the product and departments.

Their I learned all bout the electronics department. From electronic, Site-2-Store(online orders), to the departments i was actually placed in Photo center.

We would have to collect the resources that we needed, such as, carts, trash bags, pallet jacks. I would separate by isle and take the department isle by isle. I believe that the hardest part about the job was trying to get the department stocked within 8 hours when the department(s) had longer than that for the stock time.

typical workday,a typical work day was working a full shift with in unloading freight with a crew of about 4 avg. What I learned is that managment nor fellow crew members where not eager to help me learn anything new that I needed for my job. Mangagment was the most unhelpful as we stated our concernes and gave our input when asked but all they did was take it under advisement and that was as far as it ever went. The hardest part of my job was the lack of team spirit as some didn't want to do their job and wagged behind and others wanted tell everyone else what to do while going off themselves and doing nothing leaving the rest of us to pull for the rest of the shift.

Fun place to work,I worked there for a year and a half. I started as a clothing associate and was later moved to night stock. I enjoyed night stocking so much. During night shift I got to move around the store and learned all the departments. I learned how to mix paint and make keys so I didn't have to hunt down someone else to do things for a customer. Yes everything was timed but that was the fun part because it was always a challenge of beating the time and doing a great job. Management was amazing. They tried to help in everything and really  cared about how you were doing and always tried to balance your life with your job. The only thing that was tough was the point system. If you missed a day you got a point but you had to wait for six months for it to fall off. It would have been nice to be rewarded with the point falling off earlier if you happened to improve on your attendance or times or something. Also almost every month managers would try to do fun fundraisers to help the community and charities.

My co-workers were very helpful when training me, they helped to understand how to put information into the computer, how to put up shipment, how to fill medications, where to locate certain medication and were just very nice all together.

I do a variety of different things. Anywhere from cashing checks to just assisting with any questions or concerns. Surprisingly I do tend to learn new things almost everyday.

With management comes different personalities so you learn to adapt according to who you are working under for that particular day., I absolutely love my co-workers. They make my day go by quick, while at the same time making it a friendly environment. I would say the hardest part of my day are dealing with the unpleasant customers.

Co-workers were positive and always helpful when it came to customers and other employees. Hardest part of the job was doing the task in your department and the task in other departments that management may assign to you without their help when you call for it.

You see many different people and get to hear about things in their life you probably experienced before. My experience with my managers and co-workers has always been a good one. I learned even if your having a bad day you have to put your best effort out and typically the customers will make you smile. The hardest part is dealing with the customers who haven't had the best day or have a bad attitude and no matter how kind you are they don't appreciate it.

"Wonderful co-workers, amateur management.","My typical day at work would begin with giving associates breaks that work first shift, sorting out clothing and assessing how badly my assigned area needed attention. I would then plan out how to make the area more presentable and allot times for certain tasks (giving lunch breaks, taking breaks myself, etc.) On certain shifts, I would be required to pull items from the backroom to replenish shelf stock on the sales floor. Also, I would be asked to cover the jewelry department with no training for the position (I ended up teaching myself by watching co-workers) and was never compensated for wage differences. On occasion, I would unload trucks and sort merchandise boxes in the stockroom. The most valuable skill I learned was customer service while working here. The management staff at my workplace were very rude, unapproachable, nonchalant, unreasonable and oblivious. I have overheard management staff making fun of associates, and have witnessed them sitting in the management office playing solitaire when they were purposely ignoring the staff that needed their help. My co-workers were like family to me and I still talk to them regularly. The most enjoyable part of the job would be befriending my co-workers and satisfying the customers I helped. The hardest part of my job was advancement. I spoke to my manager on several occasions about possibly getting an interview for higher positions and was told I would get the position, then a few days later they had hired a new associate for the position.

Fun co-workers.,"Wal-Mart has very loyal employees and staff. Other than that, it isn't a very good company to work for. No good benefits are administered and the higher level employees such as supervisors and management are not interested in employee happiness with the job or with them. Their only concern is with the sales and what the customers complain about. If an associate is leveling a shelf (stocking) and doesn't stock or level as taught and leaves holes or unfilled spots, the management never notices or tries to correct this. Causing a poor outlook on the store.",3,Former Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Vero Beach, FL",10/16/13,2013,10,16

I'm very fund of the word team work because without team work no work is being done and the customers are very un-happy...To me customers are very important so its up to the staff to work at a fast paste to keep customers wanting to order more. My personal opinion about good management is making sure staff is for one comfortable as well as making sure we are up to date with very important information that is needed.

Walmart could do better,"So far I have worked at Walmart two times in my life, the first time when I was in college and recently for a little over a year. I would have to say the latter experience was the worst of the two due to the management, working EVERY weekend, and the fact that it was a second job. The recent administration that runs this company clearly does not care about its employees as much as it did in earlier years. In saying that I also feel your experience rests on the people at your given location. At my location, I felt like there were two problems that bothered me. Being constantly understaffed and having management that was inconsistent. Most days I felt like I was everywhere but my own department and most shifts I was the only person assigned to my department so it stayed unattended. When I worked nights I would have to cover 2-3 departments because no one had them covered. Also if you worked during a shift change, the incoming managers would often want you to stop what you are currently doing and do something different. On a positive note, my coworkers were pretty nice and most customers were pretty good as well. I would think as much money that Walmart makes, they would could afford to have effective people, great pay, and excellent benefits but what do I know. Walmart did, however, teach me one valuable lesson: Avoid retail unless it's something you really want to do.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Warner Robins, GA",10/15/13,2013,10,15

All cashiers got along well, if we had the chance we would help each other out with our customers, by bagging groceries,checking prices,giving upc codes, or by answering questions about things they didn't know, of course there were things none of us knew, because when there were store meeting, we the cashiers were never told what went on in the meeting that affected us,it went to the css (the managers over the cashiers)and that's where it stopped.  The hardest part of my job was telling a customer that I took care of their request/complaint by giving it to management that I didn't know what was going on with their problem I gave it to the manager but I would check into it again knowing the manager discarded the complaint for lack of not knowing  what the customer was talking about.

I was expected to know our products and be able to direct the patients to the best purchase for them. I was taught to listen and get to know the patient, so I was just selling them any product, but something that was best for them and their needs.I really liked being a part of a smaller group of people that worked closely with each other and developed friendships, and also the one on one with the patient, and ensuring their satisfaction._x000D_From there, I was given the opportunity to spend some time in the pharmacy and in November 2012 switched to that department.

Great experience,"Working in a field which touches upon the healthcare side definitely benefited me. In such a fast pace aura, I had to time manage my day. Constantly dealing with drugs the whole time, I got the opportunity to learn about the contradictions of drugs. In addition, dealing with insurance companies opened up a new window on how finance is processed. Furthermore, I am a very social person, hence I love dealing with customers and doctors throughout the day. Helping the patients get what they want in a professional timely manor gives me the pleasure of working there.

No home life.,"When I began with the company I enjoyed the work. It was fast paced and could be challenging at times. I worked for the company for three years and can tell you that what Sam Walton created with this company has gone out the window. This is partly because the company is monopolizing the retail industry but mainly because the company no longer cares about the employees that run the stores. Corporate leaders that are in charge of the company have not spent required time in the store to know what it is like on a daily bases and still require more and more from their employees. It is a shame that it has turned into this and I challenge every corporate employee to work in a struggling store for a week. I believe over half of them would not survive an entire week. I promoted to assistant manager and went to a month long training that was a joke, I learned more about management from a 3 day shift management course through McDonald's. I graduated the training course and was placed into a struggling store. Why was this store struggling? Because the lack of training! When you do not train associates you cannot expect to get much from them. It saddens me that this is how a company that hires 300+ associates per store treats its people. As an assistant I was expected to work 5-6 days per week and 12-14 hours per day. I had no life outside of the store and was not compensated for it. This company is a billion dollar company and chooses to not pay associates accordingly; they treat associates like slave drivers would treat property.

Nice place to work at.,"A typical day at work: Make sure to arrive to work ahead of time, with badge and ready to clock in and walk away from time clock because others have a certain amount of time to clock in before being marked as tardy. Be friendly as your walking to the front of the store where the cashiers are and check in with Lead or Manager on duty that day to find out which register to work at and keep stocked with plastic bags and make sure work area is cleaned at all times, anything that does not belong at the check out get put in a cart for someone to pick up and take to customer service and sorted to be placed back in the proper area, anything that is dairy or frozen gets called to be put back asap, Always always make sure cash register has enough change. What I learned: Some people can be sneaky and try to distract you from looking in their cart and under heavy objects and inside plastic storage containers. Management: were very busy, assisting cashiers with voids and questions from customers. The hardest part of the job for me was Time Management, not giving myself the adequate amount of time to sleep in between jobs, I worked graveyard at one and came straight to work here. The most enjoyable part of the job: Was meeting people talking to them and helping elderly put what they purchased into their carts and make sure that they weren't heavy.

I worked in the produce department and although that was your primary function, they make you cross train with all surrounding departments, which allow you to learn new things. The people you work with were either very good at what they do, or was just plain lazy.

A very nice place to work.,"A typical day is a day when customers behaved very well to employees, and employees worked as a team with a lot of fun and laughter.

The Hardest part about the job is pleasing management; no matter how much we get done they still want more done, which is hard to do on Five out the seven days of the week because the lack of workers, which 90 percent are partime and only ten percent are fulltime.

I could barely deal with the managers. When they are on the bottom they try to be your friend and once they get a higher position they change. I'm the same all the time. Their management team including the store manager do not care about their lower level workers which is not fair because they are the ones that do all the work and the reason the management get all of those promotions and recognition. My co workers were messy and tended to mind others business before their own. Beyond that I got along with just about everyone I just knew what and what not to say. The job itself I can say was not hard. The most enjoyable time was break and lunch.

My coworkers were always willing to give a hand if needed. The management was good at times and not so good at times. They got moved around a lot. So it was hard to get to know them. They all knew what they were doing. Just have to say miss the people and loved the knowledge I took away from working at Walmart.,3,Former Employee,Photo Technician/Cashier ,"Bryan, OH",10/4/13,2013,10,4
Most stressful place.,"You do not have a life outside of Wal-Mart.  Management get called in on their days off.  Always work beyond your shift.  There is no job security.

Excellent Employer,"Wal-Mart is a wonderful place to work! A typical work day starts out with an employee meeting (usually mangers and employees). We discuss our strengths and areas of improvement and our action plans for future success. Then I go off and take care of the back room for the remainder of the shift. Wal-Mart is a great place to work if you are responsible, goal oriented, and driven. We have time sensitive goals to meet each night, and it MUST be done. Sometimes it is like a race to see how fast things can get done, but that is the exciting part of the job. I believe the hardest part of the job is being able to stop. Sometimes you have to find your stopping point and except that there is just no way it will all get down (due to call outs, low staffing, or unexpected freight.) My co-workers are excellent and we work like a well oiled machine. All of us know our work places and we each jump in and help one another out if needed. The best part about my job is the ability to learn and grow. I have learned so much about big box retail and about management that I now want to pursue a career in retail management.

im sure there are other walmarts that are better than the one i worked at,"a typical day at walmart was assisting customers with choosing the right electronics and accessories they needed. Working items onto the floor and organizing the displace to make everything fit and have items relating to the product near each other. I learned that alot of people dont really know the difference between electronics and what most of the contents in them are such as lcd led and the processors in lap tops and tablets and cell phones. Management was overall lack luster they didn't treat the employees that well, but there were some managers that seemed real interested in there employees and they always kept up to date with them but that was very few members of management. My fellow coworkers were for the most part great to work with. Some of them didnt really comprehend their job to well but were still good people and friends. Friendship was easy to find among the workers of walmart. The hardes part of working at walmart was that they were always short staffed so you would be pulled away to assist other areas of the store witch normally isnt a problem but when your area also doesnt have the appropriate amount of workers  you really fall behind in your area.

Great starting place to Work.,"A typical day is fast paced Customer Service making sure the customers gets what he/she wants. A lot of cleaning is involved on a daily bases. Stocking shelves is also a huge part of the job. What I have learned is you must trust your fellow co workers that they do their share, and if they don't finish always be able to lend a hand, because if their job isn't done then the work area will fall apart. Also the basic experience of cleaning, proper use of a Fryer, Slicer, and Rotisserie. Managers care that you get your work done, they are hard on you sometimes but they know what is best for the company and for the workers. My co-workers are a fun bunch of people, all come from so different backgrounds which implies challenges every once in a while, but overall we get the essentials of what needs done. I say the hardest part of the job is anything can happen at any moment that can throw us off from getting our daily job done.

I got my first advancement by my manager not wanting to wait in line for his break and asked if anyone ever offered a electronics associate position which not only made me a merchandiser but a cashier. Wal Mart then started a new POS system which required more work load which I did not mind I learned how to operate a forklift no Receiving Lead so me and other employees rotated between job so was not required to pay for position but held all the responsibility.

"Productive, busy, and fast paced","A day at the store that I worked at was a lot of freight to be worked to the floor, cashiering, and covering other departments.

I also learned a lot about managing others that I work with, mainly the new individuals that don't know what they should be doing. My management was hard to get a hold of so you had to make sure that the customer is taken care of at all times no matter what the situation is. This brings me to the next thing that I learned a lot about which is dealing with customers. At Walmart it seems that you get a lot of individuals that already have a bad perception of the store and therefor aren't happy so you have to learn to deal with a lot of different individuals that are happy or upset. The hardest part is making sure that the customer gets what they are looking for and that you go above and beyond to make sure that happens even if you have a lot of other tasks to complete.

Also I am enrolled in college online which requires a lot of time as well and with me staying over all of the time, having to sleep so I could go to work and do it all over again, I fell behind on all of my classes.

A Flexible work environment. Easy going on the weekdays.,"The hardest part of the job would be when customers would come in to return merchandise that was not refundable. Also, when they begin to accuse that we had fault with the service. Of course, we try to accommodate to their request, but a lot of customers would lie. It happened on a regular basis. I feel as if a lot of people abuse the policies of Walmart. Walmart tends to give refunds for mostly everything. Co workers were ok, some were arrogant, but i tried to make the best of my work environment. I learned to have patience with customers. Patience is the best way to win them over.

Not as good as it seems on paper.,"It seems like a great job but it is not as great as it seems on paper. While yes you can make 20 dollars an hour working at the distribution center you will almost never work a full work week, much like the stores. The 20 dollars is only on weekend shifts that are only scheduled 36 hours and will rarely see that many hours. This is one of the reasons why so many walmart associates are dependent on government assistance, yet the Walton family is worth 100 Billion dollars, but I digress..._x000D__x000D_Everyone is paid the same once they reach a certain time in, so a 20 year associate essentially makes the same as a 3 year, showing no return on the loyalty that they have shown to the corporation. _x000D_Also there are jobs that are ridiculously easy (hauler) versus jobs that are literally, physically destroy your body over time (shipping, order-fillers), and they also pay exactly the same. _x000D__x000D_Management is spotty, there are your desk jockeys and those who literally will sweat and bleed right beside you.

Poor production and very unorganized and stable environment,A typical workday in my position is spent filling in for 4 or more different job codes due to faulty lack of staffing. While working with this company I have progressed as an individual in my customer service skills as well as my attention to detail. Management in this company have a very different prospective when it comes to treating their team equally. It just isn't an option for most. My fellow co-workers are a delight to work with and I as a member of management enjoy helping them excel and learn all of the things I have in my journey. The hardest part of working with the Walmart company is trying to get the outsiders looking in to see that every community is different and the demand for certain things are different as well. The most enjoyable part of my work day is being able help people. That is being able to help my associates with any problem they may have as well as helping our clientele find everything they need in their shopping trip to leave happy.,2,Current Employee,Over Night Support Manager ,"Norristown, PA",9/25/13,2013,9,25

Plenty of work but you'll never finish.,"The store that I worked at (Benton Harbor, MI) has many very dedicated employees and managers within it.  The major problem with Walmart is corporate not scheduling enough man hours to finish your tasks.  This in turn effects customer service and creates out of stock situations where the product is in the building (stockroom) but with a lack of employees it is not put on the sales floor.  Hopefully this will someday change a bit for the better, as it is getting to the point where it is affecting sales and vendors may not give the bottom prices due to the fact that their products are not being stocked.",2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Benton Harbor, MI",9/24/13,2013,9,24

A typical Wal-Mart,"A typical day at work started with a meeting giving us an idea about daily sales and how many pieces of freight to expect on the truck on a given night. At the end of the meeting we would be told which aisle we were to be working and how much time we were being given to work said aisle. After leaving the meeting the employees were expected to work together to sort the freight to the aisles before beginning working on their own. Once in an aisle we were to take the freight to its location on the shelf, rotate it close dates were in front to be purchased first, then 'zone' it to make it look good. Any left-over freight was to be placed on a 'rocket-cart' and sent back to IMS to be binned. Employees were expected to help other employees finish their aisles once finished, and if any time was left after that, help IMS bin._x000D__x000D_Management- To be quite honest, it was hard to keep track of what management wanted at a given time.

If you're willing to be hard working, honest and responsible, Walmart is the place for you.",4,Former Employee,Inventory Management Specialist ,"Cañon City, CO",9/19/13,2013,9,19
not a good place to work,"The only real good thing about working at Walmart is the ability to have a life outside of your job. I come in every day, look at my tasks, stock shelves, build endcaps, zone, bin merchandise, whatever they want me to do and we never get any recognition or thanks for what we do. Management will always look down on you as inferior and the zone managers spend more time on the computer than they do on the floor helping you. When you work in a shorthanded department, there is absolutely no opportunity for advancement because they will keep you there in your position and say they are too short to afford losing you even if you are qualified to move up or to another department. I've been turned down on promotions four times and each time they tell me it was for that reason. Coworkers are generally easy to get along with but also are rarely happy with their jobs.",2,Current Employee,Housewares Sales Associate ,MO,9/19/13,2013,9,19
Dont do it!,"Been working at this dc for 3 months. Mgmt doesn't care abt their employees (at least in this dept). Difficult to make production. High turnover.

Check the associate call out list to make sure I know what type of coverage I would be having for the day/night.  Assign associates to their designated areas and have an associate meeting to relay the expectations for the day/night.  I would do a walk through the store with my support managers for a plan of action.  I would say the most challenging part of my job would be when we get a high number of call outs, knowing that the outcome still needs to be good. I would have to make business decisions and get the best possible results.

I personally just don't let things such as that get to me. Besides being stressed out on the job, it does have it benefits. I enjoy the 14% off on my phone bill as well as items in Wal-Mart.

stressful and unappreciated work place,"Walmart puts itself out to the public as a family oriented business who truly cares about their associates but after working there for 14 years I saw it more as Walmart is only out for the money and really doesn't give their associates the credit they deserve. Without all those hard workers, there would not be a company. I believe their associates are underpaid for the amount of work that is expected of them . Bonuses were given to employees on a quarterly basis depending on how well your store's profit was. If it was low, then sometimes there would be no bonus and employees were expected to do more to increase sales. Management always got there bonuses   regardless.

A fun environment with lots of customer relations.,"A typical day at Walmart for me was overall very busy, I worked in the photo lab, connections, electronics, and dotcom. I learned a lot from this company. They taught me that no matter what day you are having, the most important part of retail service is that  your customers are happy at the end of the day. Management and I did not see eye to eye on some things, I think the major factor was a lack of communication within the management team, without it something is going to go wrong. My coworkers were awesome, I am huge on being able to work efficiently and effectively with fellow associates. The hardest part of my job was being able to calm down customers who were treated badly, but the most enjoyable part was seeing their smiles when they walked away from me happy.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Electronics ,"Livingston, TX",9/17/13,2013,9,17

The hours were flexible and the training was thorough. The managers however were not trained as well as the people working directly with the customers. They were always switched from department to another without properly learning the previous one. The communication between them was beyond terrible as what was discussed with the manager of the front end at the time of discussion was not relayed to the manager that was taking over causing some employees to lose their job as the new manager did not know the issues at hand with that cashier.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Elyria, Ohio",9/13/13,2013,9,13

Fun and enjoyable work space,"A typical work day depended on what shift one was given. When I worked there, I normally cooked. Each item on the hot bar had a specific time it was pulled, weighed up, and thrown away. Once the time was getting close, one would recook the specific item and replace it. Also, we loaded and unloaded the rotisserie oven. We packaged and placed the hot chickens out for customers while chilling the older chickens so they were able to be bought with EBT. Customer service was a large part of the job. We would serve the customers at the hot bar, but also on the slicing side.  We would get the order, and fill it promptly.  As well as cooking or serving the food, we would prepare the food for the store. We made sandwiches, salads, lavash, and wraps. These items were made throughout the day for the cases and as backup for the next day._x000D__x000D_I quickly learned how to run a slicer, an industrial deep fryer, and a rotisserie oven, which were essential to work in a deli.

A hard life but a decent one,"during my time at walmart ive had the opportunity to work in pretty much any job position, from sales to instock, and cold storage.  But once I learned all these skills I found I rarely spent time in my actual department doing my assigned tasks, and tho i understand the importance of helping the ""team"" there were times where i was doing the jobs of 5 other people due to short staffing and during my time as an overnight stocker I was disciplined for a mealtime violation after being asked to work overtime, because of this I was declined further advancement for a full year, regardless of superior work ethic.",4,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Dinuba, CA",9/11/13,2013,9,11

Nice place to work,"As a cashier you have a tedious job. That was the only downfall. It was an easy job but doing the same thing 8 hours a day got old.

Sometimes customers were just rude and that could ruin anyones day. They were very nice when I called in sick for work though.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Lexington, TN",9/11/13,2013,9,11
Hard work but very productive and quick,"I was an unloader, the most physically demanding job at Wal-Mart I believe. It was simple enough work. I had long shifts but they went by fast because of my position. The managers were annoying from time to time, but that should be normal with managers until the one time a manager tried to deny all of us unloaders a break one day. The situation was fixed very quickly. They had a kind of military attitude, that meaning, shut up and do your work and do it efficiently.

I was not trained outside of watching computer videos. They were not willing to work around my life schedule. I worked overnight. The coworkers were unhelpful, as was the management.

I would go between my duties in lawn and garden to having to do whatever needed to be done in pets, hardware, toys, sporting goods, housewears, fabrics, foods, to the back to unload trucks, and even outside to bring in carts for customers.

Since I have been there I've learned how to do special orders for customers, and how to put data in the computer, and change batteries in watches and do watch bands.The management is ok too for the most part they are pretty nice. The co=workers are pretty nice too and most of them are fun to work with. The hardest part about the job is that the rules keep changing day by day. They tell you to do one thing then turn around and tell you to do another. Sometimes the rules get confusing. The most enjoyable thing about working at Walmart is meeting new people everyday and trying to make customers happy.When I know that I made a customer happy it makes me happy. That tells me I did my job correctly.",3,Current Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Louisville, KY",9/11/13,2013,9,11

I think for me the hardest part of the job was trying to stay on step ahead of the shoplifters on determining what there next moves were.

"Very active job, you never get bored","A typical day at work start with a meeting to get everyone organized in their departments for the night. Once you receive your assigned department you immediately go to work down stocking the freight left for you there by the unloaders. Once this is done you start breaking down boxes and stocking the products. Most nights a feature is also included in your freight, when this happens you have to use your judgement to place it strategically. a good placement will ensure the product moves quickly which makes room for your next feature. This was the part about the job I loved most. The other great thing about working overnights at Walmart was my co workers. some of the best people I've ever known and im still close with them today even though i no longer work there.

"Good pay, but hard to balance two different lives","Working as an overnight associate, coming to work for the entire group was somewhat of an unwanted hassle. Associates view it as a chore that they are bound to because of the benefits they receive. Students especially have hard times with the shifts due to early morning classes or school activities. The shifts are set at 8 hour days. Thus, it is easy to gain more hours in less days, however, covering shifts is difficult. Management tries to keep morale up but does not always succeed or even show it themselves. It is somewhat easy for certain people to get in trouble, which can determine whether or not you can move to any other positions or even other locations.

Every day is a learning experience,"A typical day at work usually begins with filling scripts or inputting new scripts into the system, then going through everything that needs to be called on or fixed.

Always staying busy,"Customer service is always busy, if not helping customers, we are helping department associates get their returns to the floor, or out on a register helping get lines down. I have learned to be very patient and understand with customers, and other associates. The hardest part of my job was having to tell customers that there are certain things that we can't help them with. For example, certain returns only have a limited amount of days to do an in store return, and certain items like breast pumps or blood sugar meters can not be returned at all. Although customer service gets many customers that aren't happy with the service they got either on the floor or at the registers, it was always enjoyable to help them leave with a positive attitude and still come back to shop.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"North Richland Hills, TX",9/6/13,2013,9,6

Met alot of market managers from other cities. I would say the hardest part of the job was to ""think outside the box"" .

Core Values are Expressed but not always Practiced,"Everybody has their ups and downs when working with Walmart, but the core values have always been to treat the customer as top priority. Depending on management and staff, this value can sometimes be neglected. Walmart is a good company, overall, with low prices to help consumers. However, the employees are nonchalant when it comes to customer service. A major reason for this could be the lack of compensation that Walmart offers for its employees. A company that makes so much money should distribute their pay a little more on the lower end. What I enjoy most about working for Walmart is the ability to show employees and customers that whatever they believe about Walmart and the way the company has became over the years can easily be detoured. For example, I come across people everyday who are impatient with long lines and dissatisfied with the customer service. My job from that point on is to make a difference in the customers' minds that someone is at least trying to maximize effort. Even at times when the store is understaffed, I can find a way to get customers the service they've been waiting for.",5,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Pineville, LA",9/5/13,2013,9,5

However small or big it is, everyday I learn something new because I am curious and always willing to ask for I know my managers are always willing to help as well as my co-workers. Honestly there isn't a part of the job that I find hard because I have learned everything needed to do my job throughout the years I have worked with the company.

Bitter & Sweet,The company has had many opportunities that seemed potentially attainable. The only thing holding any associate back is the lack of mentoring and having associates working more positions outside their pay grade that they do not get to progress and learn as they would like.

Most of my co-workers were awesome, but a few of them didn't want to do any work, they were just there to get a paycheck.  The hardest part of the job was the stress of having so many people waiting to speak with you while still having a list of tasks to accomplish.  But at the same time, seeing the customers walk away satisfied with whatever service or information I provided them with was probably the best part of the job.",4,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Floor Associate ,"Cleveland, GA",9/5/13,2013,9,5
"Overworked, underpaid.","A typical day at Walmart was like a day in prison.  Everyone there was so demoralized that they wouldn't even speak to most people.  Upon saying ""Good Morning"" to someone, they'd only reply with, ""hey.""  If you asked anyone how they were doing, the most common response was, ""I'm here.""_x000D__x000D_Most people at walmart did not like the way the company ran.  They felt as if they were not given their fair share.  No one wanted to promote to a leadership position because everyone saw how overworked and under appreciated they were.  I had an assistant Manager stay in the store for 4 days straight without going home just because he needed to finish his job._x000D__x000D_Walmart does not have good benefits, they insist on paying the lowest wages possible and even cap wages at 17.50 per hour regardless of how many years you have worked their.  Walmart does offer healthcare and other services at an affordable cost but they aren't near as good as any other provider._x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job was actually motivating myself to finish the work I had to do.  Promotions were also hard, the highest rating for someone's performance is called 'Role Model' however the store managers will never approve that rating for anyone because according to them, ""no one is a role model.""  Working with others was often difficult as the lack of professionalism meant that asking anything of anyone would almost always result in an argument or them expecting you to do them a favor later on._x000D__x000D_Another very difficult thing to deal with at Walmart is ethics.

At my location management has been known to show a large amount of favoritism, and those to whom it is given can get away with almost anything. While working for them I have seen employees fired for first time infractions while others have shown an alarmingly blatant disregard for policies, coworkers and customer. _x000D_Management shows a lack of empathy for their employees, to the point of disregarding their safety and well being. Little to no appreciation is shown, at one point in time I was told that my job was not important. Some parts of the store operate almost like a high school, cliches are formed and sometimes used to harass and scare those who are outside them._x000D_The pay is laughable, and the customers know they can get away with anything._x000D__x000D_Pros:_x000D_While some employees are horrid, there are those who almost make the whole job worthwhile.

"Great place to work, with plenty of opportunities for advancement.","Whether busy or not, Walmart is full of things to do.                                   A typical day includes interacting with customers, keeping a clean and  acceptable work station and, completing delegated tasks. I found management to be a little hard to communicate with at times, but one has to realize, that they are human beings just like anyone else. They too have deadlines and tasks to complete as well as overseeing subordinate associates. Co-Workers at Walmart were like a family. I enjoyed my co-workers as much as, or even more than the job on certain days. We were like a family, and I made life-long friends in my time with Walmart. The most difficult part of the job, may have to be getting large tasks done with little notice or little help.

Great Place to work for but bad management,"Wal-Mart is not a bad place to work for. With what other workers are saying about them not paying while on the clock is not true. What I have learned is that some wal-mart stores are not so great such as my location. Some of the management is rude and some are nice but it just depends on the location. The most fun part on the store is working in the backroom as an Inventory associate which is picking the merchandise, scanning counts and floor counts and audits. The not so fun part about working in the back is unloading the GM trucks which is very stressful with many damages and things falling on you. It depends on how the truck is delivered and everything gets shifted around. The other part is many favorites in the store which is where a manager would select their favorite on who they think would  be great to move up to a dept manager. This depends on the store also and many other managers go by the policy which is not favoritism. I have seen and witnessed many things that should not happen in a store and it does and I have seen this happen to almost every retailer I have worked for",4,Current Employee,Inventory Associate ,MI,9/3/13,2013,9,3

Management insult employees in front of customers.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Vancouver, WA",9/3/13,2013,9,3
Busy and Interesting days,"A typical day at work would normally start at 5:30 am . I would set up 22 registers and 4 service desk registers for opening time 6 am. Made sure everything was up and running, by everything I mean the 5 bathrooms, bottle recycling room, ATM's, doors, and of course the registers. In addition, I had to organize and take back all the merchandise that customers left around the store, we called that overstock and zoning. Throughout the day I attended to customer needs and associate concerns and managers to do list, all while making sure the bathrooms stay clean and every one performed their duties to the best of their abilities. Also, I needed to make sure everyone took their breaks on time and assign them registers. What I learned from Walmart was to delegate tasks more effectively. I always stressed about doing it all until my supervisor explained to me the delegating concept, things ran much smoother for me after that. I love customer service so that's what I enjoyed the most. Being able to help customers find what they came for and putting a smile on there face meant my job was done.

Management taught a lot and really allowed you to develop. if you weren't on a team assignment, there was limited co-worker interaction.

Hard work but with job security.,I must say Wal-Mart D.C. 6054 in LaGrange  Georgia is a good place to start as a young person that is seeking good pay and time to go to school.

Very slow but productive at times. Fun and serious work place. The main problem is how the employees are mistreated and under paid.,"A regular day working at Wal-mart, the feelings can be neutral, fun at times, and depressing. About 60% of the staff, employees, are very lazy and its very frustrating to see when your a hard worker. The work is quite easy but the quantity is often huge, and the time is short. I truely enjoyed working there, but the hardest part of my experience was to work very hard for a small pay. My years of experience in this field should have given me a great starting pay, but I was basically looked at as a new hire, with no experience, getting minimum wage. Although I was suspected to work with my years of experience. Very unfair. I did learn alot of things dealing with the company and how to operate certain machines.

Retail Experience at Wal-Mart,"I work in the produce section.  A typical day consists of stocking all merchandise in the Department and making sure the sales floor is fully stocked.  Completing claims on expired food.  cleaning the Department.  Culling or ""picking out bad fruit and vegetables and expired merchandise.  I learned about inventory management, ordering merchandise, stocking and rotating, compliance issues.  Like any other job, there are good and bad managers at the store considering approximately 300 people work at any given store.  I will state that favoritism based on race and ethnicity is a MAJOR issue at this store which really lowers morale.  It also amazes me that Wal-Mart places no merit whatsoever in the fact that I am educated and have a Bachelor's Degree.  They only focus on job performance, and attendance, seniority and experience for promotion.  The hardest part of the job in my department is the constant ""physical labor""  all throughout the shift being required to constantly life 40, 50 and 60 pound boxes and ifcos.  There is a lot of pressure to get the merchandise to the sales floor quickly, thus leaving you exhausted by the end your shift.  If you are a 20 year old male with strength and stamina, then you are good.  If you are a middle-aged woman, it is very challenging.

Professional Workplace,A Typical day at work for me i dealing with customers right off back. Greet the customers make sure that they were satisfied with the items that they were purchasing and make sure that the leave the store with a smile.

Productive and fun place to work,"A typical day of work changes for me because I have learned how to do so many departments in the store that I go help out all over.

Hardest part of the job is feeling like I chose to learn all the departments to give better customer service in the store but don't get a pay increase for it. Most enjoyable part is my co-workers and knowing that I helped a customer to the best of my ability. My opinion is there is to many managers and they tell the associates different information which gets everyone confused.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Photo Technician ,"Fishers, IN",9/2/13,2013,9,2
Management is self contained,Due to several shift changes and permanent removals of my supervisors in my time working at walmart who all demanded various wants and needs throughout the months inside the store I learned that any foundation I attempted to build couldn't be made. Co-workers where only interested in self preservation and outside of worthless bantering I couldn't connect with most while I also tried to assist newer employees it became impossible to please the newest supervisor that lended to greater difficulties. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I completed my tasks while also improving the area I was assigned too.

A good place to work with a few drawbacks.,"I would, on a typical day, go in for my shift and begin by tidying my aisle to keep it free of clutter and debris. I'd organize my shelves and make sure they are stocked well. This job taught me that there is more to providing excellent service than just asking if ""that will be everything for today,"" or closing a sale. I learned to communicate efficiently, to product promote, every customer deserves 100% and to manage my time wisely. I would take on extra jobs, outside of my intended job specifications (i.e.- re-stocking various departments, staying extra hours voluntarily, working in different parts of the store, and working as the door greeter/ security.) Management left a lot to be desired from my superiors as they didn't always write people's schedules down correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people out and gaining that invaluable experience and various skills. I learned a lot about teamwork, communications and time management.

I inventoried Ipod, Laptops, Ipads, and other tablets.  During these tasks I would help customers with technical questions, location assistance, and honestly, I got to know a lot of regular customers.  Knowing a customer enabled me to better serve them with their needs, and sometimes new products._x000D_I learned a lot about the theory of inventory, being heavily involved in 5 store inventories.  _x000D_The hardest part of the job is when someone tells of a problem, and they way they state the problem, you realize that that customer really needs a solution, and there is not a product that is available to help them._x000D_The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of helping someone that does not think there is a solution to their problem on the shelves, but we find one that works.",4,Current Employee,Electonics Associate ,"New Richmond, WI",9/1/13,2013,9,1

I ended up getting whole weeks off and other coworkers were getting two weeks off at a time. Management was horrible also, no one listened to what you had to say. One assistant manager would tell you to do something and the other would get mad at you and tell you to do something else. One time I was very sick, but I thought I could make it through the day, I kept throwing up all over the store and in front of all the assistant managers. When I told them that I should go home, or actually to the hospital, they told me to sit down at the fitting room with a trash can and keep working my last two hours.

We didn't have a store manager for such a long time, so none of the assistant managers or the co-managers knew what they were doing.

Fast paced enviroment that requires a great deal of self control,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is very fast paced. In this environment I have learned to efficiently use a cash register and how to deal with customers with the utmost respect.  Unfortunately, the management is very unorganized.  Some managers are always on top of things while others slack at their responsibilities and duties.  If every manager does not have the same mindset the store will continue to be in an uproar.  However, my co-workers are what makes the job way easier at times.  My personality allows me to meet numerous people and develop relationships with them with no problem. These relationships make me feel more comfortable while working at Wal-Mart.  The hardest part of the job is when you come across a problem at your register and the manager does not react fast enough.  This causes your line to back up and customers start to complain about the length of the lines in the store. However, I believe the most enjoyable part is the satisfaction of having a job.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Norfolk, VA",8/31/13,2013,8,31

They are very good at recycling - their employees!,"This was one of the worst places I ever worked! I applied at Walmart #1677 in the hopes of being able to advance in the company, and expecting minimum wage was excited to hear I'd be making $8.30/hr, but was sadly mistaken after being there a few months! If you're hired at any position - besides cashier - you're able to cross-train in almost any department so you have some great advancement (and pay increase) options, but if you're a cashier like I was they won't let you switch anywhere in the store. They are so understaffed with cashiers that they don't let you switch anywhere else in the store, but they do cut your hours so that they can train all of the Sales Associates on the registers so if they are getting long lines they can just bring up all the associates instead of getting more cashiers. They treat you like dirt, and if you don't kiss their behinds you're treated even worse! The Customer Service Managers (CSM'S) that run the cashiers are a bunch of young immature barley out of high school kids who are best friends and play favorites with the cashiers and hardly ever do their job, and if you're not in their ""group"" of friends than you better not even sneeze wrong!! If you do you'll run the chance of getting fired for something you didn't even do! _x000D_I was beyond excited when I was able to put in my two week notice and able to leave the store!

If you're looking for a way to become register trained I would definitely suggest working at Wal-Mart on Arlington because it is a super center and they have all brand new registers and train you in everything you need to know. _x000D_A typical day would usually be busy, our busiest days were thursday, saturday and sunday. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a customer who is angry, but only when you're new. Once you get the hang of everything you learn how to handle certain things, and you don't become so overwhelmed. The most enjoyable part about being a cashier in my opinion, is providing a very fast and accurate checkout for the customer and bagging all their bags appropriately. A lot of customers would compliment me on my bagging because I was so good at it. That was the best part for me. While I was at Wal-Mart I learned how to open up and start conversations with people I didn't know, I also learned that if one thing goes wrong or if I make one mistake it's not then end of the world and I don't need to get angry about it.

The management on duty is often described as organized chaos but gets the job done none the less and is often the hardest part of the job mixed in with high demand from the customers and adapting to meet every need and expectation. The most enjoyable part of this job is the high volume in customers which helps keep me busy and  being able to create the team dynamic in my department.

Awful Place to work.,"Wal-Mart has to be one of the worst places for employment.  I started working there as a cart pusher and not only did I have to push carts I also had to do maintenances job and had to work in the bottle room.  I was only paid minimum wage but I had to be in so many places at one time.  And had so many tasks that were part of the job.  I would be gathering carts out in the parking lot and I would get called inside to fix the bottle machines or take out the garbage or assist customers with carry outs.

You however can find stores where the culture is not as prevalent. This can be a very rewarding place to work when you are prepared to come in and actually work.

My fellow managers, we all work as a great team, by helping one another if needed in certain situations. I have a great rapport with my associates, my associates are the work force behind success of the area that I am over and without them it would be impossible to get all the necessary daily task completed. I would say the hardest part of the job is within my area which is consumables, that consist of grocery, paper goods and chemicals, health and beauty, cosmetics and pets, the issue is keeping the side-counters filled because these areas are constantly shopped. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is, I take pride in motivating my associates, using my leadership skills, demonstrating the highest level of Integrity and ethics. I really enjoy being a role model for my associates, it makes me feel like I have accomplished something when my associates enjoy working for me demonstrate the same level of Integrity and Ethics.",5,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,Shreveport LA,8/24/13,2013,8,24

It was not just working with the Pharmacy Team, but also the whole Walmart team. Everyone guided and helped everyone out. Things were not to complicated, everything was simple once we got our full training and picked up on the floors. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with questions which were not related to our field of work and expected to literally take them where they needed help to which slowed down our work flow.",5,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Bakersfield, CA",8/22/13,2013,8,22
Great Place to Work,"A typical day as a cashier is a pretty simple. Mostly you are just behind the counter ringing up customers. It would be a very interesting thing to do, but it is the customers that make this job worth while. You talk to so many people throughout the day and they all have something different to talk about. Other than ringing out customers you will clean your area whenever you get the chance. This is really a plus because it keeps you from having to constantly stand behind the counter for hours. What I've really learned at this job was great customer service and patience. When I first started working at Walmart I was very shy, but now I am a very open and talkative person. Patience, with some of the customers that you will get patience is really key. I mean we're all going to have that once customer that is just going to rant and rave and the best thing to do in that situation is stay calm. It used to be very hard for me to deal with the upset customers but at the moment I have no issue with that. Just let them explain what they're problem is and help them to the best of your ability. My co-workers are also who helped make my job as fun as it was. They were just extremely sweet people. Some of them will end up being your friends for life. Even though Wamart was a very enjoyable job for me, the worst part had to be the upset customers and the best part had to be your upbeat customers that would come and just make you laugh and have a good time to the point that you kind of forgot that you were even working.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Ocala, FL",8/22/13,2013,8,22

Over-worked and under-paid,"Considering I was attending college while working at Wal-mart, the steady work hours and flexible scheduling was a huge benefit to working there. Unfortunately however, the amount of work allocated to the understaffed departments, along with poor management, poorly maintained equipment, group evaluations and a yearly scheduled raise made it a highly undesirable job for me. It is near to impossible to get overtime, let alone move up in the chain of command at the store and because they cycle through dozens of employees every month, it was hard to stay motivated while working there. Worst of all, they would force you to stay past your scheduled hours, force you to leave early or take an extended lunch to compensate for your extra hours and threaten you with termination if you receive overtime.",2,Former Employee,Inventory Control Service Associate ,"Pasadena, TX",8/21/13,2013,8,21

Flexible Work Place,"A typical day at work would involve clocking in, going to a register, getting a break every two hours or so which was beneficial. On average, I work about 7 hours a day. It is difficult to get a full time position. My favorite part of the job was my coworkers. They are comical and fairly easy to get along with which made the stressful days easier.

Working there was hard between having numerous bosses wanting you to do certain things and having those things done at a certain time but it really has showed me the value of hard work and to appreciate working period. A lot of my co workers were blue collar workers, they came in  and did there job for 8 hours. I liked them. The most enjoyable part of my job was when my shift ended.

Great Benefits but very unorganized management team,A typical day working at Wal-Mart was constant drama and never knowing what was going to be thrown your way. I have never seen so much back stabbing and back biting in my whole time of working. Every day you never knew what was going to happen. The Store manager was terrible. I never knew that that being two faced and keeping mess stirred up was expectable as a Store manager. There were so many unfair things going on behind the scenes that it was ridiculous. I remember management firing all of my employees but one and they expected me to get the same work load done. That was totally impossible. The proper thing that should have been done was the hiring of more employees before firing all of my current ones. That's just common sense.,4,Former Employee,Bakery Supervisor ,"Little Rock, AR",8/20/13,2013,8,20
Poor management and associate caring,Walmart has changed alot throught the years. When I first started it was a very positive fun place to work. They really cared about the associates and their families. There were oppurtunities for advancement based on your knowledge and abilities. You really felt that they would take into consideration your knowledge and abilities when offering suggestions to improve productivity or better customer service.You had managements support of you and the decisions that were made. Now there is little to no training for new associates.Management is mostly invisible and rarely speak to you.Everyday is an uphill battle to provide good customer service  because of lack of trained helped in all areas of the front end.

Productive and fun,A typical day is clocking in and jump right in to where the last employee left off depending on department. You can learn A lot in retail if you are open minded about it and have urge to want to learn they will teach you. A few managers jump into management and become not so good because most of them do to others what was done to them.

productive workplace with much hard work,A typical day at work in Wal-Mart is VERY different than any other place i have been. My job dealing with cold to sub-zero temperatures everyday takes a huge toll on the body which affected moral. Management in the store was more like boot camp instructors which was quite amusing but none knew the terrible conditions my co-workers and I had to deal with. Having to work in extreme cold temperatures was the toughest part of the whole job because almost everyday my co-workers and I was sick and could barely get our job done but we did without complaining and we could'nt call in because Wal-Mart has a policy that they do not accept a doctors notes and give 3-days a year to call in with consequences for call-in after your 3 days. Through all the bad the things about the company there was a two bright lights in it all and that would have to be my co-workers and the ability to buy stock in the company while working there which they took directly out of your check.,2,Former Employee,Frozen-Dairy Associate ,"Norwich, NY",8/20/13,2013,8,20

Graveyard shift is not for people who want to move up.,People on the graveyard shift are not asked to advance and are often overlooked when promotions become available. Management never has anything positive to say. They always find something wrong with whatever you did. They now time your task. Put you on a production based schedule but don't pay you for the more tasks you complete. I've been there 8 years and the raises are all ridiculous. The average raise is .40 cents a year.

"Expectations and Stress Level Very High, Terrible Technology","As a staff pharmacist at Walmart, I am supervising 6 to 8 technicians at a time while the pharmacy produces 600 to 700 prescriptions in a 12 hour day. The work load is very heavy and the phone rings non-stop while the customers come at you from all directions. The company requires pharmacy to interview and/or hire techs from within the company before looking outside the company for more qualified or trainable persons. The pharmacy currently has a staff of 12 techs, 2 are high school drop outs and none of them are nationally certified. Several are transfers from other departments within the store and they are very nice people but simply do not have the mental aptitude to be quality pharmacy techs. There is no advanced tech training or incentive for techs to become certified or gain extra knowledge. Walmart has a CYA company culture and therefore has more policies and rules than any company I have every worked for and does not support pharmacy as a profession or pharmaceutical care whatsoever. They do not allow professional judgement or any decisions to be made regarding what, how, when, how much to dispense to a patient. The computer system is better than PDX but not nearly as fast or user friendly as competitors computer system and there are not enough computers, cash registers, no counting machines, robots or baker cells. Prescriptions each take a minimum of 10-15 min and the workflow is very labor intensive and frustrating. Techs are obsessed with 15 min breaks and 60 min lunches like no other pharmacy I've worked for. It's almost a union mentality with all the rules and breaks. - more...",2,Former Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,"Richmond, MO",8/20/13,2013,8,20

My work day consisted of frying all the food for the deli hot case and the family meals. I also helped cut fresh deli meats and cheese when it became very busy. I often closed the deli down on the days I worked which include cleaning everything from dishes to the floor. The toughest part of the job was holidays and filling all the orders people place while still serving walk-in customers. I really learned well how to control stressful situations while working here.

We end up having lots of overstock that piles up in the backrooms for days until our managers notice it and decide to pull it out so we can try and put it on the shelf's, but most of the time it doesn't and we end up sending it all back again. _x000D__x000D_The management in all honestly could probably do better, but most are to scared of loosing their jobs that they try to push us more so they can say later to their bosses that they had us do this and that. _x000D__x000D_The micromanaging of the store management IS KILLING WALMART and the fact that walmart doesn't treat its employees like an asset makes people more likely to avoid walmart as an employment option unless they truly need a job and I mean badly!

I enjoy working for this company,"Wal-Mart is good to work at especially with the customers and fellow employees.

"Very poor work environment, management not professional",Walmart in a nutshell was the most clicky environment I personally have ever worked at. The Assistant Managers were terrible to work with.

I recommend strongly to reconsider this company.,1,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Socorro, NM",8/17/13,2013,8,17
I like helping customers.,"My typical day at work starts by checking my scheduled tasks. Then go-backs have to be put away. I start straightening the shelfs that are  the messiest (like rugs and waste paper cans or towels on the floor). Product on the floor can be a safety issue if not taken care of right away. Then I check to see if critical picks have been pulled for my departments, and put them away. When zoning, if product has been put in the wrong place, I will correct that before going on to other products. I am very detailed oriented. I really enjoy the team work I have with my co-workers. It gives me a feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day. The hardest part of the job is having a closing shift one day then pulling an opening shift on the next day. My greatest pleasure comes from helping our customers. Many customers will come in the store and ask for me to help them. When I have finished with them, many times I will turn around and there are 2 to 3 more customers needing help. As the economy has changed, many stores are having fewer people on staff, so it is essential that we can help the customer locate their products. Happy customers bring in repeat sales. That's how we grow our business.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Foothill Ranch, CA",8/17/13,2013,8,17
Good Job,"I like this job, i love doing warehouse work. My team is awesome, well my team was awesome but after a few of my top members left management fail to hire replacement. By company standards I should have a crew of 7 associates daily. i only have 6 associates in total. Try spreading 6 associates over 7 days. on a good day i have a 5 person crew. That isn't enough to complete the amount of work that they put on my shoulders. But somehow we get everything done. Half of the time I have to make decisions on freight weather it will go to the sales floor to be stocked or stay in the backroom to be stored. A decision management should make at their 2 pm meeting. I really have no complaints about the job, but just wish there was more communication between management and supervisors or more like the lack of common sense in the management",4,Current Employee,Inventory Supervisor ,"Laredo, TX",8/17/13,2013,8,17
Great place for a first job but not good for long term,"On a typical work day I was outside working to fetch all the carts throughout the parking lot if I was not asked to do anything else. I learned to further tolerate people with attitude and appreciate customers. I also became more social than I already was. Management was at times great and at times bad because although they did try to accommodate for us, they also were very strict such as when us cart pushers needed a water break and they started limiting when we can get water. I loved my co-workers everyone was friendly and fun to work with they were just a great group of people. I would say the hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all the customers because Walmart is a heavily busy establishment.

Lower management is not very knowledgeable,"This company had good plans and procedures in place but the lower level manager did not follow these.  It is very hard as a new associate to get needed information about company procedures and practices.  I came from a company before where team work among supervisors was a very big thing and I noticed Walmart was the opposite.

The best way to describe management at Wal-Mart is ""the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing"".  While one member of management expects one thing of you, another expects something different.  I have learned the importance of networking at Wal-Mart: a valuable lesson that is unfortunate but true as it is not your ability, work ethic, experience, or education that will launch your career to new heights at Wal-Mart, but simply with whom your may or may not be friends.  The hardest part of working at Wal-Mart is stomaching the revolting amount of disrespect that is shoveled upon one's shoulders as a mere Sales Associate.

Strong corporation with little value for the people who make them what they are.,"I would have to say that I assumed WalMart would be a better corporation to work for but it seems they are not. I made better paydays working for fast food corporations than for WalMart. Mainly because I am only part time, I have had to wait now 2 years before ever getting a paid vacation plus no sick time for part time people. Over the two years I have worked for WalMart it has been a slow downhill slope. It keeps getting worse with even more work always being had and fewer people to do the work.

My life at WalMart,"I truly enjoyed my job at WalMart.  I believe that most of us that worked there considered each other as you would family.  This was our work family.  When one of us was in need, we stepped up to the plate to help each other out.  Not just at work but in our personal life as well.  I was good at my job and well respected by the employees at WalMart.  I believed in being a team player and that the manager or supervisor should work along side their employees instead dictating and sitting back.  I tried to do this with my employees.  The hardest part of my job was when I had to let someone go, not for gross negligence but for simply they were not working out through no fault of their own.  Of course in saying that I have no problem with ensuring that my job is done. I would not put that off on someone who was not their supervisor.",5,Former Employee,Zone Manager ,"Asheboro, NC",8/14/13,2013,8,14
Poor,"They work you like a slave, with little to no appreciation. I learned how to talk to people easier and start a conversation out of little to nothing.

Not So Enjoyable Job,"The job I was hired to do, I actually enjoyed. I organized, stocked, color-coded and displayed clothing. I also assisted customers. However, during a typical day at work, I did none of the above. I spent most of my time doing other peoples' jobs. I'd spend time in grocery stocking shelves. I'd spend time at the jewelry counter helping customers. I'd sit at the fitting room and answer the phones and let people in the fitting rooms. We were extremely understaffed in the store, so I would be assigned everything else to do besides my actual job. So when I got back to my area near the end of my shift, my sections would be a mess and there would be mountains of returns that needed put away. And the management would get upset with me for not doing my job, when they were the ones who assigned me to another area. Management were often scattered, and rarely did any work on their own. They were unorganized, and would rather the associates worked in the back or in grocery than in our own areas, and they didn't care at all about customer service. The managers were continually rude to everyone around them. My co-workers worked as hard as I did, and they too felt the same way I did. The hardest part of the job was simply trying to please the managers, who were never satisfied. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I occasionally got to work in my sections with the clothing, and come up with display ideas.

Management, they are great sometimes I mean hey will come out and help sometimes and f course Wal-Mart isn't a place where you would be able to support yourself let alone your family with. What really made me mad the other day is when they wanted to train me for the service desk and everyone knows you get paid more money but then my manager told me that its only about 30 cents extra and it has to be your permanent position, for example if I'm a cashier and I am mainly a cashier and I help out at the service desk occasionally I will not receive the 30 cent raise. Of course this other incident that happed yesterday was after me and another employee were finished getting carts which we always do even though its nowhere in our job description and hey have cart pushers who are always calling out. Anyway when we came in from outside our customer service manager gave us a slip for doing a good job and you need 3 in order to get 10 dollars cash for a free lunch but he told us that it went down to 7 dollars and that we had to buy out own lunch then take the receipt to the service desk to prove that you bought lunch and they will give you the money back.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Abingdon, MD",8/13/13,2013,8,13

Would also have to manage the front end to ensure that customers are getting through the cash registers in a timely manner, opening other cash registers when needed, and therefore calling up associates from other areas of the store to help. That could be a challenge. I would come in contact with associates who did not want to help up front because they would say it was not their job and therefore had to tell them that it is part of their job. In a non-union environment everything is your job. I would also have to troubleshoot computer, customer, and associate problems. Mostly with successful outcomes. I've learned in this business that you cannot please everyone no matter how respectful you are of others opinions and try to empathize with them. Writing and giving associate evaluations was also part of my job. It was enjoyable as well as difficult because I worked with friends as well and was many of their supervisor. Writing an evaluation on their job performance is tough.

Fun and Dynamic workplace,"After I clock in for the day, I go to the deli and assess the overall condition: does anything need to be prepared, does it look clean from the customer's point of view, etc, then I go in and assist with any cooking or preparation that needs to be done if there are no customers to serve. If there is nothing to do, I go find my supervisor and ask if there is anything that needs to be done or anything new she has time to teach me so I can increase my overall knowledge of procedures. Working at Walmart has taught me how to be more patient and cooperative with customers and coworkers while still encouraging me to be myself and stand out from others. Members of management are also friendly and willing to assist with problems and answer questions in a timely manner, often teaching me about little nuances of a procedure I hadn't noticed before. They interact well while still maintaining the necessary degree of professionalism required by their position, which I can wholly appreciate and admire. My coworkers are also friendly and cooperative, all of us working together to make sure our section of the store is always in a state of cleanliness and order of which Mr. Walton himself would be proud. The hardest part of the job, for me at least, would have to be remembering when to take my breaks; I get so caught up in the rhythm of serving and preparation that I lose track of time and almost miss my appointed break times.

I've learned how to adjust to different situations quickly & how to cater to customer needs based on customer and situation while working at walmart. The management team is okay but it could be better. I enjoy my coworkers because everyone helps each other and looks out for the best interest of the the company while trying to satisfy the customers.

The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smiles on the customer's faces when I have helped them resolve a problem.,4,Current Employee,Customer Service ,"Batesville, MS",8/8/13,2013,8,8

Fast paced and very productive work place,"A typical day at WalMart for me is to go to the fitting room and check what daily tasks are assigned to me,usually I will cover the Fitting _x000D_Room for the other associates lunch and break times, afterwards I usually put away all the customer returns, and make sure the department is clean by picking up things off the floor., If the store is really busy I am called on to run the register and help to get the lines down., what I have learned at work is to be flexible in all aspects of the job, the hardest part of the job sometimes is being switched around so much on the working schedule, I will be scheduled anywhere from 7:30 to 4:30am and the next day will be 2 to 11pm., It is a little difficult to plan anything sometimes because of this.

Nice place to work,always busy helping costumers and stocking freight. Managers changed store about every 2 years so u were able to see different managing styles. My co-workers were always easy to work with. I would say the hardest part of the job was when a delivery didn't arrive on time and we had a very short time to get the freight stocked before store opened in a.m. the most enjoyable part was getting to help costumers on a regular basis,4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Turlock, CA",8/8/13,2013,8,8

Sam Walton's influence exists no more,Wal Mart was what kept many small communities going years ago with it's tax base to the community and jobs provided.

Very fast-paced environment,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers, ringing transactions, closing out a sale, and zoning register aisles.  I learned how to be patient when dealing with extremely rude and obnoxious customers by waiting for a member of management to handle a predicament and learning how to get customers to apply for a Wal-Mart credit card.  The management there is pretty nice and loose, but due to the high traffic volume (esp. on weekends) and lack of organization within the store, they don't really address a cashier's or customer's request for assistance in a timely manner and end up angering or upsetting the customers to the point that their issues never get resolved.  As far as my coworkers, they are pretty nice and understanding and almost always help me when I need help, but sometimes, like customers and myself, they can also get stressed-out and frustrated and tend to not be as friendly during peak times when things start to get a little too rough and hectic.  The hardest part of the job is learning how to be patient and calm when things get very hectic, esp. when I have to deal with a rude and obnoxious customer and a member of management doesn't come in a timely manner to address and resolve the situation.

"Hard work and Priorities,","The ideals at Wal Mart are great. They believe in customer service, friendliness, personable faces and attitude. I was a temporary employee for the holidays. I learned a great deal about prioritizing. The management were good, stern and knew the best way to get things done. However, I do feel management could have listened a little more to their employees. There were times that I felt that employees were brushed off by management, however, things are run smoothly and as needed to keep the store efficient. My co-workers were all hard working, honest and decent people. A joy to work with. My co-workers communicated in order to keep things running smoothly, and that was what helped the most. The most enjoyable part of the job, honestly, for me was helping the customers. Considering it was Holiday season and customers were in a rush to get their shopping done, it was a pleasure being able to get what they were looking for, for them. A typical day at work started off slow, putting away returns, and doing zone work to make sure the area was clean and safe for customers to move through. Then the rush of customers would start just before lunch. Second shift was busy right from lunch on to about just an hour before closing. It was difficult managing responsibilities, opening and closing fitting room doors, locking them, separating returns, repairing damaged goods and reporting damaged products, returning items to their designated areas and answering telephone calls, and working with customers in person at the same time. But it was during this that I learned to organize myself even more, - more...",4,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Bellingham, MA",8/2/13,2013,8,2

Walmart - Are you ready to forfeit your worth?,"To start, Walmart is a fantastic company for everyone in the world who doesn't work there.  If you ask any employee - they will tell you that they hate their job and they wish that they could find a different one.

I never get many chances to work day shift and I am always stuck working mid shift or second shift. That is fine by me though. It is always so busy and especially on the weekends, the front end is always backed up and all register trained associates are required to come up and help get the customers checked out and about their business.

"Very hectic, very crazy, very overwhelming...","Working at the front end is not for the faint of heart; the lines are always long or its so dead that you'll have nothing to do at all. People are often rude and there's very little you can really do to fix some of the problems that arrive. Customers come to you wanting to know where things are, but there's little chance you'll know since you are only ever at the front end. If the register locks up or something goes wrong with a transaction, you usually can't do anything but wait for one of the CSMs to use their key and code to fix it. The policies also often change and there's barely any time you'll ever get to do the CBLs or attend meetings unless you come in on your time off--though they do compensate you for all meetings._x000D__x000D_Also some of the higher-ups you deal with in the front end have different ways of doing stuff and it can be confusing working to every one's specific expectations. And you often have to work on holidays and shifting hours since it never closes. Breaks and lunch is mandatory depending on how long your shift is, but generally 90% of the time you have to be relieved by another cashier and waiting for somebody can take quite a while. Being late for lunch gets you in trouble, though sometimes its nearly impossible to get off the register on time._x000D__x000D_But if you get hired full-time or work there long enough, the benefits and pay are pretty good.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Redding, CA",7/31/13,2013,7,31

Wal-Mart is a great entry to the workforce.,"As an electronic and wireless sales associate working mid and second shift is all about stocking, cleaning and selling. At the Turkeycreek store a typical day in this roll can be hard and discouraging. The freight that comes in for third shift is pushed to the back by the morning shift due to the morning shift department manager taking all but one or two associates to the back for “cleaning, inventory, picks and whatever they can do to stay off the floor.” Picks are done in the morning where the department manager, with their “help,” scan the department for items on the shelves that are low and go in the back to pick them from the bins and roll it out to the floor for the morning associates to put up.  This is also where most of the cleaning and setting up displays are performed.  Around 11am the directs arrive to be checked in. directs are the boxes of movies, music, games, MP3 Players, cards and other items. Remember there is only one or two associates out on the floor doing all this. At 11am morning shift associates begins lunches. A mid shift associate comes in around this time and then they roll out the freight from the previous night. All stocking should be done by 5pm and then your focus is on selling and cleaning. However, this is not the case… freight and directs are still being put out up to late night, around 9 or 10 at night. The reason, not only it is a lot of merchandise, but throughout the day you have to pick up and put away returns, talk to customers, sale and do the site to store.

Every store has issues but the one at 5500 Thomasville Rd. is down right awful. It starts at the top with store manager.  Once you become his target you are done.

It is really a shame they do not value the hard working employees over the lazy ones, I seen it over and over where they promote the person who is not best for the position but the one who can be controlled in that position the easiest. I also have seen managers with many many years experience canned for the littlest infractions. I am not bitter about Walmart at all - its just a job, I am trying to fore warn any one thinking about working for them to really weigh all your options. The managers for the most part we easy to get along with and I had no bad experiences dealing with them. You cannot work another job along with Walmart also they want to control you to flip your schedule around, they want to pretty much own you.

Not only on a single shift, but between shifts as well. No one knows what the other is doing or how to do even the most basic tasks. How can you manage and instruct associates if you, yourself don't know how to do the associates job? The company policy on sick days is set up to require you to voilate their policy in order to use your earned sick time. You must miss two contiguous days to get paid for one day, yet you are only allowed 3 call outs. So in order to use your 3 sick days, you must miss/call out 6 days.

Very awesome place to work.,As a cashier I enjoyed the many benefits of working in many different departments to help out. You could transfer to other departments on a regular basis as positions became available. I can't even begin to described all the different things I learned from typical cashier job to customer assistants in electronics to crafts to health and beauty aides.

Corporate Wal-mart has strong ethics.,"A typical day at work is to complete any/all notes given by the Store Manager and to follow Daily Routines per SOP's. Each day is different and based on freight flow, number of associates, holidays-just basically anything the entire store needs-be ready to do it. Must be versatile and able to change directions at any given moment. I have learned to 'turn on a dime', the hardest part of the job for me was lack of planning for upcoming events and scheduling which I adapted to the Wal-mart way as they operate although the hardest part of the job is knowing that I could make a difference with the planning skills I have. I could and would love to make a difference by incorporating a structured training program which would give associates more information to do their jobs with les frustration as well as set them up for success as well as lower the turnover rate and increas customer satisfaction and instock conditions.",3,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,Las Cruces NM,7/30/13,2013,7,30
fast paced,Being a cashier at Wal-mart is great way to interact with people. I scan customers items while having a positive attitude. I started out as a people greeter about 3 years ago.  I wanted to be promoted to a cashier position after a year being a people greeter. I taught myself by watching other cashiers for about 2 months. The store manager was impressed and so he promoted me. The managers are hard on employees because they want to continue the successfulness of the store. The hardest part about working at Wal-Mart is being around negative people because I am always positive. My most enjoyable part of being a cashier is when a customer tells me they love coming through my line to checkout.,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Flowood, MS",7/30/13,2013,7,30

Handling go-backs, shrink, coupons, ad match, action codes, credit card applications, and balancing the till. I learned a lot about how to talk to people, how to identify with individuals from many walks of life. I learned how to work with a register and manipulate it to preform the needed actions.

In this job I learned that there are many guidelines on how to deal with customers; however, you have to deal with them per situation.  Walmart, just like any customer service job, likes to be very customer friendly and make the customer feel special.  Management is very understanding of the associates needs and try and make you feel part of a team, which I really enjoy.  My co-workers could be a little hard to work with, as some did not adopt a team attitude, and would only really look out for themselves and not the company.  I would say the hardest part of the job would be balancing the work schedule, and trying to get all your work done on top of taking care of customers.  On the other hand, an enjoyable part would also be the customers.

"Great concept, poor execution","Walmart has lost its way in the corporate culture by allowing regional managers to bully and beat their store management into submission on issue after issue. The morale at almost any Walmart you go to stinks, and that is because they have quit adhering to the core values that made Sam Walton so successful. They have let the bottom line become everything and the customer is left out. Worse than that, if you think they treat customers poorly, you need to see the way they treat the average associate -- it's very bad. Everybody has to remind themselves daily: ""I am lucky to have a job,"" otherwise the urge to quit would become overwhelming. But that only goes so far and after the 1000th customer complaint, that you are powerless to fix, something breaks inside you.

My managers we're very strict and consistant on zoning the sales floor every twenty minutes.  After I did all of that, I would typically layout the frozen bread for the next work day on racks.  Everyday it would usually be something different that I would have to do. For example, one day I would do the ""organics,"" the next day i would be organizing the cooler or freezer.  Which was the hardest part of my job.  Managers would pull pallets of frozen goods which I would have to unload and stock in the freezer.

For transfers, I call their store to see if they are still interested and get the required information about them from their Personnel Manager.

The worst work experience I have ever had.,"My experience working for Walmart was not a pleasant one. At my time of employment, we had a tyrant for a store manager that made the assistant managers lives so miserable that the assistant managers would then take it out on the rest of the employees that worked in  the departments that they were all assigned and oversaw. I understand that some people like to give ridiculous goals to set in order to get more work done out of their workers, but at Walmart I did not feel like this was being used as a strategic approach to get more work done because it was like that in all the departments for one and for two every time goals were not met, you would be ridiculed for not meeting the insane goal they had set for you and your department. I also while working there had an issue with a fellow co-worker and it took me reporting the issue 3 different times to 3 different people including the store manager himself for any action to even be taken. They then went on to moving me around to all these different departments while they were figuring things out with the problem co-worker even though I wasn't the one that was the problem and was actually the victim in the whole thing.

not the best,"Work is ok , not full time and pay is minimum wage but the job should pay more.  Managers at my location show alot of favoritism and friends of csm's are interviewed and promoted but no one else hears about the position being available or is asked if they would like to apply.  Upper management is aware of some of the favoritism but nothing is done so its like talking in one ear and going out the next.  Some of the csm's over rule each other as far as delegations go.  Some associates don't really do anything all day then complain when they have to actually work.  when i first started no one told me temporary was 180 days did not find out until after the bonuses and then told that i didn't qualify because just recently became regular.  Its ok for the time being until school is over.  If i could stand to not have it i would have reconsidered had i known what i know now.",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,FL,7/27/13,2013,7,27

The attitude that you bring with you to work is what most determines how your day will turn out._x000D__x000D_My immediate CSM tended to treat new employees like idiots, which resulted in them asking other cashiers for help, rather than asking her. In addition, it was very stressful to have to approach her with a problem that only she could assist with.

The management was  willing to work with me on my schedule and the hours were decent while attending school. Walmart was a great company to work for while attending some college courses and for a small income during high school and after. I enjoyed conversing with customers while helping them with their purchases.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Fort Worth, TX",7/25/13,2013,7,25

this particular store is not a good work enviroment,"this is the second wal mart store i have worked.  I was so excited when coming back to wal mart i thought it was going to be like the store i had worked in years before..this was not so..the wal mart i now work for is full of lazy management, there is dishonesty among all the management team starting at the very top , the store manager, they treat you as if you are children, job loyalty,team work and going the extra mile here is not rewarded...it all depends on who you know here.  our department manager works whatever hours she wants to work and nothing is said to her because her husband that also works here and get away with stealing is the store managers sons little league coach..they have cut all our hours in the past 2 months...i now get a whooping 15 hours a week and i have worked there 3 years and only make 8.60 even though i have scored above average on all my performance reviews.  Management is not held accountable for anything it all gets thrown on the associates .  At this particular store they put a hold on supplies in the ad office so that the store manager gets a high bonus.  So things we need like hand soap, gloves, dish detergent, hair nets etc we can't get in for weeks at a time because there is a block on ordering. We are told to write down supplies needed in our area to perform out job then after doing so the DM tells us we don't need it and refuses to order it...therefore we then have to cut out 10 inch rounds out of half sheet cake to make 2 and 3 tier cakes and cutting half sheet boards in half to provide the board for 1/4 of a sheet cakes. or my personal - more...",2,Current Employee,associate ,"Lumberton, NC",7/25/13,2013,7,25

A Work Place Great for a Student,"At first its a little confusing to remember where everything is located, such as the Items, departments, and what person works in what area. Once working for awhile and getting the swing of things it becomes easier each day. learning how to fix and stock your returns, mix paint, create a hunting and fishing licenses, and knowing how to talk to customers keeps you active and makes the day pass by very quick, sometimes to quick. Walmart management treats there employs very well, just as good as the costumers, and live by the phrase ""the customer is always right"". At times where we as a staff have done great work through out the year they will reward us with bonus's and break party's, which made it the most enjoyable part of the job eating hot dogs, pizza and ice cream with your co-workers. And being a student while working is pretty tough at times and the management will always try to help out, if its giving you specific days off, giving you less hours or just working on the weekends. It makes it a great work place for a student.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"San Benito, TX",7/25/13,2013,7,25

A learning experience,When I first started working for this specific Wal-Mart I was excited for the numerous opportunities Wal-Mart gives its employees. I was pushed back by the lack of education which soon trickled into the lack of respect some managers showed to employees. This has been the biggest test of my life because of work ethic amongst management and my fellow co-workers.

It takes a while and a lot of hard work to move up in the company, but the plus side of it is they are willing to work with you if your interested in moving to different departments in the store.

"High paced, innovative company",Fast paced environment is an understatement.  A typical work day was never the same.  The company would have different directives everyday.  I  had to be able to change me direction sometimes in minutes.  I had deadlines to meet everyday.  It kept me interested and excited about my job.  I have learned to be more patient by more vocal in the goals that needed to be met.  I learned to work with a ever changing management team to meet the same goals and directions in purpose of customer needs.  We achieved our goals daily to ensure instock was there for the customers.  If it wasn't for the customers there wouldn't be a job.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers faces when they received the help that they needed and left with what they came to our store for.  I also enjoyed leaving feeling like I accomplished something everyday.  The hardest part of the job was to coach people for things they needed to improve upon.  But I knew that it had to be done for improvement of my area.  I did get better at it as time went on.  I believe that the people make the company a better place to work.  If you have good people you will have a good team.  If you have excellent people you will have an excellent team.  Training goes a long way to better improve my associates to ensure a smooth process.  Holding people accountable and being fair is on of the most important rules and standards to live by.  I do not ask people to do something that I wouldn't do.  I dig in with them.,3,Former Employee,Operations Zone Supervisor ,"Buffalo, MN",7/23/13,2013,7,23

The co- workers at Walmart are very hard working people who are courteous, helpful, and polite.

Productive if often busy workplace,"  A typical shift at Wal-Mart began with unloading the grocery truck, breaking down most pallets by aisle onto rollable carts for easier stocking.  I was usually assigned one of the more basic aisles such as paper or cereal, or else set to refilling and/or changing features.  I learned a good bit about store-level logistics and Wal-Mart's inventory control process, and where and how that process could break down.  Management was mostly positive, however they were given somewhat unrealistic expectations to hand down to us.  My co-workers were mostly good, steady people, able to keep the freight moving and stock their designated aisle within the shift.  Unfortunately, high turnover and inconsistent expectations from above meant that we were often asked, over and over, to do more with less.  The best part of the job was that each night, we had a way to measure progress (how much freight was left), whereas in more directly customer-oriented positions, there are no such markers.",4,Former Employee,Associate ,"Port Arthur, TX",7/22/13,2013,7,22

"The pharmacy at Wal-Mart is a hectic, fast paced environment","While working in the pharmacy I have learned how to speak clearly and calmly to customers and fully explain myself, even when they are irate.  Furthermore, I have learned valuable knowledge and experience in filing prescriptions, deciphering doctors' handwriting, navigating insurance billing, and the entire prescription filling process.    _x000D__x000D_I have worked shifts at all three pharmacies in Winchester and have greatly enjoyed the camaraderie and teamwork that the other pharmacy technicians provide.  The pharmacists are also professional, knowledgeable, and amiable.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with the customers because they often don't understand the pharmacy filing process (such as why their prescriptions aren't ready or why the insurance is not covering the medicine).  The most enjoyable aspect is spending time with my coworkers.   _x000D__x000D_However, unless you become a pharmacist there is no upward movement within this division and the rest of the store tends to think you're a snob, thus moving from this department is unlikely.  Plus if you did move back to the main store expect a pay cut.  The pay is on par with other retail pharmacy positions if you are certified.  If not yet registered, there is a training program available.",3,Current Employee,Registered Pharmacy Technician ,"Winchester, VA",7/22/13,2013,7,22
Walmart overall is a good company to work for,"I learned a lot in 8 years of employment; however, the people that are in some of the management positions show favoritism when it comes to promotions, and even who they wanted to keep around in the company. Furthermore some of the managers at the time at the store I was employed at didn't even follow company policies when it came down to coaching, and terminating employees. Having the wrong people in positions can corrupt a company sometimes.",3,Former Employee,Support Manger ,"Greensboro, NC",7/22/13,2013,7,22

Walmart is a company that truly cares for their employee's,"Working in the Walmart environment was a bit tough at times, some days were a bit more complex then others, but in the end it was still a business that was always achieving excellent performance. The hardest part of working their at times was when the store was busy, you surely needed to be on your toes on days like those, but their were also days when things were superb, service, work ethic, cooperation & communication throughout all employee's, it was a pleasure working for the Walmart Family",4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Hammond, IN",7/22/13,2013,7,22

I consider my coworkers very nearly family.,"While I did not work at Walmart for an exceptionally long period of time, considering I'd only intended to work there for a year or so, I feel that my 4 years there indicate that I am at least passingly familiar with the company and its practices._x000D__x000D_On the whole, I enjoyed my time at Walmart very much.  My responsibilities were very clear and consistent, my expertise was appreciated and utilized, and the coworkers that lasted more than a few months were competent and lovely people whose lives and happiness I consider myself invested in.

I went into the hospital and I was fired for a no call no show when I called the manager and explained the situation. I didn't have issues at work with being late or anything.

"Great company, Not a lot of opportunities for advancement",Wal-Mart has a great culture and does a lot of good things for its community.  My co-workers are a big part of making my day successful because we all look at our shift as one team.  A typical day at work would be organizing my crew for the expected amount of cases we will be receiving.  I have to determine how many people I will need and make adjustments through out the night if we lose cases because I truck doesn't come in on time.  I also take care of all the administration for my team such as accountability and commendations.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with the re-profile of the perishable building and adapting to the upcoming changes.  The most enjoyable part of my job are the people I work with and learning to work as a team to overcome any challenges we may have for that day.  ,5,Current Employee,Perishable Receiving Manager ,"Cleburne, TX",7/22/13,2013,7,22
I can't honestly blame this company for an individual's actions.,"The work environment was typically stress free and motivating. I learned that's sometimes people act out in stressful situations no matter what they job title is and that just because they acted towards me doesn't make the act personal against me. The management team was professional and unrelenting. I worked with a mix group of individuals, some harder working than others because there was no real reward system for doing a good job, or no real verbal counseling for doing a terrible job. The hardest part of my job was standing on cement floors for up to 10 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with and serving people in my community.",5,Former Employee,Customer Service Specialist ,"Albion, NY",7/22/13,2013,7,22

Not a great company to work for. ,I would come into work right after school and work till 9 or 10 at night. I would start with opening my register and end the night with the same drawer and counting my money to make sure everything added up. The costumers that came through my line were most of the time nice. Then at times you had an upset costumer about something in the store or a wait because of the costumer in front of them. I would try to greet them with a smile and try to brighten their day as much as possible. I love working with the public it helps with giving you penitents. I had a very high IPH which was items per hour. The hardest part of my job was they breaks I was never given and the hours that I worked. I enjoyed my co-works very much and were all very nice and would help when I needed it.

Busy. Family style company. ,Always kept busy. They are always willing to teach you new things and cross train you as long as you are dedicated. Management are caring yet strict.
