Great first job,"Typical day at work was crazy busy, when you work in the world of retail the public never stops, by the time schools out for summer you got back to school merchandise comming in the door. Holidays were nuts at Wal*Mart. It was always nice to decorate and prepare for special events, but it wasent the greatest having to work every holiday and be away from your family. Management expected a lot from you and you were always on the front line when tasks werent completed by your associates, so delegation and follow-up were a must. I enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the Christmas Shopping season, and seeing all the newest merchandise before its for sale. I also liked the family involvement that management allowed but that could differ depending on who's a manager there now.",5,Former Employee,Zone Merchandising Supervisor ,"Norwich, CT",9/12/12,2012,9,12

Walmart was an excellent work enviroment. I enjoyed my job and my fellow Associates.,A typical day was filled with challenges and rewards. The were never two days alike.

Fast pace and no room for mistakes.,I was a forklift operator. I had to haul material to it's desinated area in warehouse in a timely manner due to dealing with food.

fun place to work,Had a great time working there. Great company. Meet alot of great people.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Snellville, GA",9/12/12,2012,9,12
Change of environment,Clocking in and being able to talk to different people while scanning their items was fun. I learned that I am a mutitasker! I never really dealt with management. My co-workers were laid back and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was getting trained.

Good place to work,"Greta to meet new customers, and interact with them. Management isn't always on top of things. The pay is very difficult to live off of, but the co workers make work very enjoyable.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Bentonville, AR",9/12/12,2012,9,12
Fast paced work environment with good job advancement,"Working at Walmart I learned great time management skills. I was pushed to better myself everyday. Quick Stocking of shelves, great customer service and the ability to prioritize is Key to success in Retail. Management realizes the potential in people that want to advance and builds self confidence in each team member. I loved working along side of some great managers. Hardest part of the job is dealing with those who just ""show up"" for work...",3,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Cadillac, MI",9/12/12,2012,9,12
Wonderful Times at Wal-Mart Supercenter,I currently work in wireless (cell phones). I float from different departments as well I am able to do price changes and qucik learner. I learn something everyday.,5,Current Employee,Wireless Associate ,"Montgomery, AL",9/11/12,2012,9,11
Productive work environment,A typical work day consisted of the grave yard shift from 10pm to 7am. I learned to read labels and match or request items for replenishment for missing items. Management assisted when they could. Co- workers worked on their isles and spoke every now and then. The hardest part of the job was staying up when normally one is suppose to be sleeping. The best part of the job is working when hardly anyone is awake.,4,Former Employee,Stock Clerk ,"Palmdale, CA",9/11/12,2012,9,11
Okay I guess,the Walmart I worked at was alright but being a stock man and cart pusher in the middle of winter isn't all that great. The job was nice and so were the benefits but the lack of transportation led me to leave this job.,4,Former Employee,Stockmen ,"Tilton, NH",9/11/12,2012,9,11

ok job,A typical day would be talking to customers and placing cake orders. I learned how to decorate cakes very well. What I don't particularly like is management they sometimes speak to you like you are beneath them. Overall my co workers are great and fun to be around. The most enjoyable thing is dealing with customers.,2,Current Employee,Customer Service ,"Bridgeton, MO",9/11/12,2012,9,11
what i think,"well, as an employee, there isn't really much to complain about except that management could be a little better than it is now. most of management at my location don't have a care in the world what is goin on outside of work with their associates and I believe they should start caring because some of the employees are under high amounts of stress and while i understand you shouldn't bring your drama to work, some people try to leave it at home but it just seems to follow them. sometimes we cant escape it no matter how hard we try. when there are people stalking one of my coworkers and management turns their head to the problem, it then becomes a concern of mine.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Watkins Glen, NY",9/11/12,2012,9,11

Work Night,Stocking shelves overnight was fine but having Managers cussing me out just for asking a question and mistreating me all the time was not fun or enjoyable. The co-workers was nice and would help sometimes but they always had drama and got me involved in it. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the people i was working with and my bosses and the most enjoyable part was having a hour for lunch.,1,Former Employee,Stocking Associate ,"Asheboro, NC",9/11/12,2012,9,11

Had a nice run,Assisted in the toys department down stock and helped customers find items,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Rep ,"Orlando, FL",9/11/12,2012,9,11
Review,"Came in every morning and ran left over freight if there was any to be ran. Picks, counts, and audits started right at 9AM. Counting the correct bin locations, picking the merchandise out of the current bin location, put them on a cart for an associate from that department to come and pick up to be ran and stocked. The management team wasn't very helpful. We were clueless about 70% of the time as to what needed to be ran and worked and what was overstock and what wasn't overstock. It was a very fast paced enviroment, which I loved and worked my hardest in. It involved a lot of walking and lifting. The most enjoyable part was to see all of us working hard together as a team to get the tasks and items out of the system right at 4PM to go home.",3,Former Employee,ICS Associate ,"High Point, NC",9/11/12,2012,9,11

Good place to work part-time while in school,"I would normally come into work and cleanup the backroom/cooler that the morning crew could not get around to. Then I would stock the sales floor with fruits and vegetables until my lunch break. Afterwards, I'll clean and organize the backroom for the morning crew and then I'll go home. I didn't learn anything new because I've done the job before, but I did enjoy working with my co-workers. They were nice and friendly and we all got along really well. The synergy we had made work very efficient. The management was readily available if you needed anything, but they weren't timely with getting back with you about most things.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Frisco, TX",9/11/12,2012,9,11
Walmart.,"it started out to be a great job, but they miss use there employees, they pay them 8.45 to bust are buts to get the store to look nice and the product up so the next day the customers can do there shoping, we had the most important job at walmart and they miss use you.",5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker/ Customer Service ,"Indianapolis, IN",9/11/12,2012,9,11

Was Ok,This job was ok. I liked it cause I met great people and was able to help people.,4,Former Employee,Shoe Coordinator/Overnight Stocker ,"Richmond, VA",9/11/12,2012,9,11
Fun place to work. Lots of different people to get to know.,A typical day at walmart consisted of clocking in and going to your assigned area. Upon arriving to your area you would then help customers or work on assigned tasks till your shift ended. Management would give vague at best instructions and you would do your best to figure out what they meant. The co-workers were mixed the younger ones were usually more friendly but the older ones were more reclusive and withdrawn maybe due to working there so long. The hardest part of the job would have been impossible to please customers. The most enjoyable thing about the job was having people come back and ask for me by name to help them.,4,Former Employee,"Associate, Customer Service Manager ","Coffeyville, Ks. 67337",9/11/12,2012,9,11
"Productive, fast paced enironment","I was a cashier and competed with myself to see how fast I could process the customers through the line.I was responsible for the cash flow at my register and age restricted product.As a big corporation, I felt I was just a number.

Great learning and hands on experience.,"While working for the Wal-Mart Corporation I learned many interesting and important material. I acquired an excellent work ethic while working for Wal-Mart. While working here I managed inventory, my employees and featuring helpful products. My co-workers actually helped me learn and strive as an employee and leader more than managers did. When I first recieved my leadership role the most difficult part of my job was managing my time. I've came a very far way since. Now I have the courage and leadership skills to make a great manager. Customer service is one of my favorite aspects of the job. Helping and seeing the joy of the customer once i've helped them is an enjoyable feeling to me. The most important part was to keep my employees and customers happy and be glad that they are part of the Wal-Mart family.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager of Home Entertainment ,"Fairlawn, OH",9/10/12,2012,9,10

Working in the pharmacy was very high demanding and stressful,"Working with the best team, helped eachother in rough situations and would cover eachother with workload, breaks and time off. We all worked in unison and made a great team. Management of the store was less than satisfactory, main reason why I left. I did not like to be a part of that ""statistic"" that the store manager was implying. But otherwise great experience and gave me the experience now what I am doing as a Medical Assistant.",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Hermiston, OR",9/10/12,2012,9,10
Working with Wal-mart,A typical day at wal-mart photo center was really good. I worked with great people and management and all 3 stores I transfered to. Customers were always friendly and understandable.There was really no hard part about my job except you have your days that you just cant please that one customer. For example if the camera they want is not in stock but you direct them to the website or another store that has that same camera in stock but it doesn't satisfy them and theres nothing else you can do. Or when the photo developer is acting up and just not doing what you want it to do and customers pictures cant be developed. You just need to stay calm and try to keep that customer calm.I havent really learned anything except you are going to have days were that one customer just wont let the issue go and you have done all that you can do. You just need to stay calm and talk calmly.,5,Former Employee,Photo Lab Technician ,"Rice Lake, WI",9/10/12,2012,9,10

I would highly recommend staying away from this company.,"Assist customers with purchasing needs, resolve all customer issues and concerns, stock and rotate merchandise. Clean all product displays and shelving daily.Walmart customers can be very rude and usually take out their daily frustrations on Walmart associates. You definitely need patience and self control to be a floor associate.Managers are hit and miss, some can be very helpful while others are clearly not suited for their position. There is a high turn over rate, with most associates lasting only six months to a year. The most enjoyable part of this job was ending my shift.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Charlotte, NC",9/10/12,2012,9,10
"Great team, great company!","A typical day at work at Wal-Mart was mostly routine and comfortable. I worked there for so many years but I liked that there was always a possibility that there may be something new that night for us to do since it is such a huge and successful company. I learned loyalty for a company and how to adapt to a job resposibility through the bad and good. The management had it's pros and cons when it was time for managers to move up in the company or to rotate to different stores but all in all I had mostly great management that was made us feel like a family rather than just their employees. The co-workers at that job were amazing because we grew to feel as a family amongst eachother and always were willing to help eachother. The hardest part of the job was working with pallets on the floor while customers tried to shop. Overnight was mostly when we had customers and it was the same time the trucks would come in so us weighing both was tough but manageable. Also at the end when the company began their cuts it was a bit devastating because how long I invested in the company, it was sad to go. The most enjoyable part was the team work, the knowing exactly what to do when we got to work and just working with an awesome company.",5,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Orlando, FL",9/10/12,2012,9,10

My Walmart Experience,I work midnight shift which starts at 10pm. I learned a lot from moving pallet jacks to stocking groceries. I learned how to work with individuals who expect a lot of you as well as individuals who don't have good customer service skills. I also learned how to complete my task in a timely manner as my mangers expected. I love the fact that my managers are not up tight but more understanding and helpful when help is needed. I and other co-workers work in a professional setting. The thing that would be the hardest is clearing so many pallets when your working alone but I always manage to complete task on time.

My managers are always precise about all details and what they expect from me.The hardest part of my job is that since I am trained in so many departments that I am required to do a lot of different tasks at one time.

They try to keep you moving but if you are a fast worker its hard to stay moving. Some are nice more attentive then others.The hardest part of the job was to deal with the most outragious customers that go over and beyond about little things.

Team work and we had great times,"My work history at walmart I have to honestly say I really enjoyed it! Every job is not perfect, we had our daily challenges! Loved my co workers and management was pretty awesome. If you had a problem, whether personal or professional, they did their best. Hardest part sometimes, trying to get a project done, and having to be called to do something else, or lack of communication. Holidays, especially around christmas, were the best times and busiest!

Life at Wal-Mart,"Since I started working at Wal-Mart in 2009 I have worked at two different stores and there is a significant difference between the two stores. It's not the equipment or even the action codes (since those all stayed the same). The store I started out with in, Brea California, the store was so organized and knew what it was doing. The managers were amazingly nice and it really did feel like a 'Wal-Mart family'. The supervisors were approachable not just by customers but by employees too. They always smiled and had a good attitude even if their day wasn't so great. If you had a question, they had an answer. I always looked forward to going to work and never complained about anything, but my hurting feet. When I had to transfer because of personal problems they said that I was always welcomed back and there would be a place for me.Then I transferred to a Wal-Mart in Saint Anthony Minnesota and the difference was shocking. Everyone seemed so disorganized and confused. No one could keep their stories straight and no one was on the same page. When it came to policies everyone had a different interpretation of them or were making up their own policies and ignoring the corporate policies. Most of them were rude and didn't care what you had to say. I felt like an outcast the entire time. I did my best to positive and energetic, when people asked me how I was doing my answer was always 'I'm awesome', but I was the only one smiling. I got the cold shoulder and everyone was always frowning and in a bad mood, which I could never understand since most of the customers were so kind.

Very hard work and uncomfortable environment because of the heat but very laid back environment for the most part.,A typical day consisted of having a meeting at the begining of the shift. Then you were either placed on a line for receiving or given a truck to unload. My co-workers were awesome with the exception of one. They all worked together pretty well to help each other out and were professional. The hardest part of the job was the constant lifting and bending along with the heat.

Not recommended,"I've never been one to bad-mouth a former employer, but I would not recommend Walmart (at the very least my particular store) to anyone. A typical day at work involved being given more task-time/work (sometimes double or more) than actual hours you were there to complete said work, but still being expected to finish it and punished if you did not. Management was very rude, disrespectful, self-serving and uncaring/unsympathetic to any situation that did not involve them and their needs. They were also very retaliatory. My co-workers, for the most part, were fantastic. I made many great friends there that I still talk to and see on a regular basis. Sadly, many have bonded over the aforementioned poor conditions.

This is not Sam Waltons Wal-Mart anymore,"This company has lost complete focus of what Sam and his wife set out to do. Provide a great company, with great products and take care of their people. Sam once said ""The only ones that know what is going on out there, the ones that really know, are the ones on the front line"" Today, this has changed. The company is completely run from Bentonville. All decisions, all controls come from there. The store manager has little if any autonomy to do what you would expect him to do; rather he/she is a puppet to the control of the company.This company does not care about individual markets, but rather tries to stuff down what they feel is best choice whether the market will sustain that or not.The waste is very high, the proper treatment of individual is nonexistent, and the old Sam principles are gone. The biggest is the ""Respect for the individual""This company has the potential of being one of the greatest employers on the planet, yet choses to use their power and money to treat people poorly, to pay people poorly and to beat down those who are not robots to the company.This is a very poor company to work for.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Iron Mountain, MI",9/5/12,2012,9,5
Typical big box company,"Working for Wal-Mart by itself is pretty degrading, but as far as the actual job goes, it isn't tough work and you do get paid above minimum wage to start. I worked as a cashier for a while and was the main point of contact for the customers. But, after standing on my feet for 8 hours at a time and dealing with hundreds of unique customers, the money I was making hardly seemed worth it. Most of the customer service managers had been promoted from cashiers and did not know what they were doing. They didnt know policies very well because neither did upper management. So a lot of the associates would get ""coached"" because there was so much confusion between everyone about the different policies and guidelines. And I remember one time another co-worker of mine came behind me and wrongly ""corrected"" something I was doing right already. When I went to investigate the policies about it no one seemed to know who was right. My co-workers were mostly very friendly and when anyone new would get hired there everyone was really helpful with training questions. However, the wide variety of people and at our store having around 500 associates there seemed to be a lot of behind the scenes drama. Most of us referred to jobs at Wal-Mart as ""being back in high school, only this time its worse"". Not to mention Wal-Mart is so proud of its values but the truth is the company may represent certain values but the managers don't. They have to ""attend"" meetings for like womans rights and things like that twice a month. But I guess all they have to do is sign up and forget about it to uppease the public. - more...",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager/ Cashier ,"Spokane, WA",9/5/12,2012,9,5

Productive workplace with job security,stock shelves with merchandise on the night shift. I was able to make decent money and had a generally steady work schedule that i could depend on.

Great company independent work is valued,Walmart is a great company to work for. I work there while in college. The typical day consist of zoning department and cashiering as well as assisting customers. One of the most important skills to have while working at walmart is the ability to work alone. I had to learn this because I was used to working in groups inorder to complete a task. In the two facilities that I have worked in management have been wonderful.

Too many chiefs,"While I did enjoy working at Wal~Mart while I was there, I feel they had too many chiefs and not enough indians! What I mean is that they had department managers and section managers and managers on top of managers, and when the dept. manager would give you a task to do, more often than not one of the other managers would pull you to do something else without conferring with your dept. manager.

"Good pay, but not worth it overall.","I was harassed daily by fellow coworkers, while management stood by and said nothing. I was barely trained, and when I asked to be taught things, they tended to do them for me instead of showing me. I learned almost nothing in my short time there. Also, on one particular occasion, I began choking in the break room (without about 20 fellow associates in there as well). I ended up vomiting after struggling to breathe for a couple minutes, and not a single person said a word to me, they simply ignored me.

I compiled weekly reports for Store Manager & helped drive sales throughout my departments. The hardest part of being here was being a first year Assistant for the largest retailer in the world. Alot of pressure is put on you & the expectations are high. But I enjoyed my associates & the knowledge I gained from this company.,4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Clarksville, AR",9/3/12,2012,9,3

Ever changing work environment,"Wal-Mart was my first job right out of high school. I loved how the company values education and worked around my college schedule. After I graduated college, I begin to look at Wal-Mart as my career. I worked my way up in the company from a sales floor associate, to supervisor and eventually an assistant manager, my current position. The most enjoyable part of my job is training and mentoring my associates, especially the younger ones. I enjoy sharing my story with them and they feel they can relate to me. The hardest part of the job is feeling like you can't have a life outside of work and having to hear associates complaints and concerns and not being able to do anything about it. Wal-Mart made me overcome my fear of speaking infront of an audience and not being so hesistant to voice my opinions and ideas, I have came out of my shell and not as shy as I was once before.",3,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Natchitoches, LA",9/2/12,2012,9,2

Managers would come up and make sure we were ready for the day. My Co-workers were great. Everyone would help each other out to make the day go faster and get our area ready for the day. The hardest part of the job was inventory and make sure you had the price change.

The work was easy and fun but being treating like that wasnt worth it... not at the store I worked in anyway.

Fun working enviornment.,Walmart was easy to get into and generally the customers were a pleasure to be around. Co-workers took a little while to want to get to know you but other than that I enjoyed working at walmart.

For example, learned how to properly mix paint, cut keys, and assist at the Fabric table. Most management were easy to work with and willing to share their knowledge and experience with associates to learn and understand new things. Hardest part at times were resets. Trying to get them done in a safe efficient manner while still trying to provide excellent customer service.

Good the first couple years then it's downhill,"I've worked for Walmart in 3 different distribution centers over the last 7 years and I'll say this it's good in the beginning because the salary is a bit higher than most local jobs however the big drawback is after 2 1/2 years you'll max out which to some may not be an issue but if you're an individual like me who has to shoulder more of the load than others I feel I should get paid more than someone who doesn't do half of what I do. Management is very poor very indecisive and inexperienced people are being hired off the street to be managers when at one point in time the motto was we'll hire from within next thing you know people with no experience are being hired and we're being forced to train our future bosses figure that one out. There's another big problem the hours are not consistent again the pay is good you'll start in the mid 15's but what good is the pay if you're only working 25-30hrs a week and it's like that for a few months. Prime example in July and August I'll average maybe 28hrs a week the next couple months I'll average 50+ hrs sounds great but there's no balance and consistency. For me to be the breadwinner of my family it's hard to plan for anything because you never really know how your hours are. If you're young fresh out of high school it's a perfect job to work and go to college if you're older than say 27 and have a family to feed I hope your spouse has a good job because you'll never advance up no matter how hard you try, and your hours are never guaranteed.",1,Current Employee,Forklift Driver ,"Baytown, TX",9/1/12,2012,9,1

Not a place to make a career,I enjoy working with my co workers however the company is not family friendly. I have 2 small boys and hardly get to spend time with them because Walmart doesn't want to work with my availability without cutting hours. I need my hours in order to care for my family and isn't able to do that without working extremely late shifts. The management is poor and only look out for themselves and not their workers.

Hard work with not much satisfaction,"A typical day for me starte at 1000 pm and begins with trying to find equipmetn that was useable to pull the freight to the floor. Once the freight was onthe floor, the goal was to work all of it onto the shelves while at the same time zoning (Organizing/cleaning) the shelves. in the morning the goals waas to have a 100% stocked and cleaned area of responsibility. This is very difficult with the workload depending on the store or area of responsibility and the number of employees and there attitudes of responsibility. The cooworkers for the most part were worried aobu their own areas, and most of them would not voluntarily assist those that need the most help. The hardest part of the work was actually moving the freight from the backroom to the floor then back again. The reason being the freight is often very heavy and the palelet jacks were ussually nto i n good shape. The best part of the job was actually clocking out.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Fayetteville, NC",8/31/12,2012,8,31

Nice Part Time Job that Prepares You For the Future,"Working at Walmart was decent. I gave it my all when I got the job. The more and more days passed, I realized everyone was laid back, calm, and not as jittery as I was. I started work trying to be perfect. I learned that you shouldn't try to be something you're not. Even when you have months/years of experience, everyone makes mistakes. Everyone looks at management as if they're super humans. I've learned that management can be one of the most stressful jobs. I've also learned how to deal with management in a way that's suitable for them and myself also. Co-Workers, some are nice, some are mean, and some are just plain weird. You'll grow to love them no matter how they are. The hardest part about the job, is that when you're expected to do so many things by yourself, and its never good enough. This job also builds your character and makes you stronger. The most enjoyable thing about working at Walmart, was the special events held in the Associate Break Room (Pie Fights, BBQ, Associate Celebrations, etc.).",3,Former Employee,Electronic Sales Associate ,"Humble, TX",8/31/12,2012,8,31
A job where the customer is right and the employee does not matter.,"When I began at Walmart I enjoyed my job interacting with customers and learning new job duties.

I enjoyed it because I was able to train the employees to work effectively in the time we had allotted.

Busy with a lot to learn daily as well as always changing,"A typical day at work for me was to make sure all items in circular were out as well as advertised. I walked each of my areas and made sure to talk with each associate as well as delegate the daily notes needed to be completed. I enjoyed interacting with my co-workers and my managers. My co-workers did their very best to get notes done and to make me shine as their supervisor due to our mutual respect for each other. My management team was there for me to lean on when I needed help or answers to something I wasn't sure about. They were willing to teach at any given time. I learned how to be responsible for multiple areas as well as a great number of associates. I also learned the business end of Walmart, meaning how the store keeps product on their shelves, the balancing of sales versus hours spent, how to keep inventory of product including damages, sales at retail and purchases at costs. It really taught me a lot about the inner workings of a company. The hardest part about my job was delegation. My job taught me that it was okay to give up control and let others do work for you. I am a detail oriented person and it has always been easier for me to do something myself and know it was done correctly than to delegate it to another. I do have to say this has changed and I have learned to put my faith in others as well as myself to get tasks completed. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I got to know. Not only have I developed bonds with co-workers but also developed relationships with my vendors and regular customers that seemed delighted to see me.

Too many managers,"too many managers each one wanted to run store thier way.Some of the other workers are not team players.When zoning,only,some of the people zoned.What I learned about Wal-mart is that if you don't butter up to the boss they will find a way to get you fired before your 90 days are up.Was working by myself.The hardest part of my job was when they would bring the stores on to the floor,for your area ,and finding somethings that didn't belong in your area and you had to take it to that area and put it away.And if they were signed out of that task and you found something that belong them they wuld not put it away you had to put it away.",3,Former Employee,Overnight stock person and zone different areas ,"Jamestown, ND",8/31/12,2012,8,31
stressful but fun,"Walking in in the morning was horrible. There would be pallets of freight left from the overnight shift.

My co-workers were nice and friendly. I socialized, but always got my work done before or right on time. The hardest part of the job would be the fact that I worked over-nights and it made me sleep during the day and I wasn't able to spend as much time with my son and family.",3,Former Employee,Maintenance/Stocker ,"Porterville, CA",8/31/12,2012,8,31

Wouldnt want to work here again,They don't promote.They do not reward their best workers with decent enough raises.My biggest gripe about this company are the layers of management. Its typical to have a kid with a college degree waltzing around and obviously green behind the ears with no prior experience. This clashes with the lower positions of people that have a ton of experience and have no degree. Working at Walmart is a good job if you just got out of high school but I wouldn't recommend trying to make a career of it.

A day at Walmart,"A typical day at the particular Walmart I worked at was stressful. The lack of support from team members and leaders really took its toll on my every day duties.My original manager worked very well with all of us as far as scheduling around school or answering questions.

Fulfilling the needs of the customer comes first always.From working at Wal Mart I've learned money management, how to approach a person in need of help, how to work as a team and how to work as an independent.Management was always amazing at what they do, when the store got too busy management would help out jus as much as a sales associate was.The hardest part of the job was learning about all the departments and being familiar with them just incase you were needed outside your assigned department, but it was good knowledge for just incase.The most enjoyable part of my job at Wal Mart was helping customers and being able to use my opinions, customers want your opinion on certain products and if you know a product well enough then it's easy to help out. Another part of my job that was good for me was the fact that Wal Mart was willing to train me to be a pharmacy technician.",5,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Emporia, KS",8/29/12,2012,8,29

"Strong customer friendly, work oriented environment","I was with the overnight Maintenance crew, but in particular i spent a majority of my time stripping and waxing the floor from night to night. I would also put together the bikes they had during the holiday season, and attended traffic control for shoppers during Black Friday. On nights where we were shorthanded in the maintenance department I would help sweep, scrub, or buff the floors.

Busy and fast paced but Lack of communication,"I did like working for walmart, I enjoyed being the first to see the new freight come in. I worked overnights. Usually the night would start off with a meeting, they tell us what we have going on for the night, where we are sitting at for sales and whats going on in the store. Most of the time the truck unloaders would have all the freight already pulled out to the floor for us but sometimes we would have to help finish unloading the truck or pulling pallets to the sales floor. It started the night off with a good sweat for sure. Then we would proceed to work our departments. Each department is different, and each employee works more efficiently in different ways. Some would sort their frieght per isle, some would run isle to isle as they came upon each box. Whatever the method. I myself had a different method for every department. I was a floater. I made a point to learn every department so i never knew what the night held till I got to work. CoWorkers were always willing to help with a team lift whenever needed. And it was a very laid back environment where people told jokes and kept each others spirits up, a good way to keep you motivated and moving. Management knew what they were doing for the most part. I think most of the managers I worked with managed to find an opportunity in every challenge. Those like everything. Management did have its bad apples. And of course I had my favorites. I liked the managers that were willing to work. Not just sit back and watch us work. Instead of downing my idea they would either accept it or come up with a better idea.

Thoughts of Walmart,"I love/loved Walmart as both shopper and employee. A typical day at work would always be fun,meeting new people every day is one of the most rewarding parts of working at Walmart. Walmart taught me exactly how to deal with customers, and in my personal life, people, that could be considered difficult to handle, even though i'm a people person, also was that hard work was recognized and rewarded. Management kept in comunication with your workers, they worked with your schedule, for those who had kids, went to school, or had another job,etc. Co-workers were great. They had positive attitudes, was honesty, very dependable, willing to work, followed directions, and got along with customers and each other. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. Other than that, the job was at ease. Things i would do on a daily base at home/outside of work. Clean, organize, load/upload, listen to problems and help solve them. The most enjoyable part of job was just being there every chance i had from working or shopping. Again, i love Walmart.",5,Former Employee,OVERNIGHT STOCKER ,"Lakeland, FL",8/27/12,2012,8,27
Steady work and easy-going enviornment,I would unload freight trucks and stock the merchandise in its proper place on the sales floor. I would also manage inventory on all merchandise that came in through vendors. The managers were decent but they could have been a lot more understanding and easy-going and my co-workers were great. The hardest part about the job would be having two to three freight trucks at a time on the same day and having to unload at least two of them. The most enjoyable part about the job for me would be lunch because they had a variety of different foods and places you could go to eat inside the store.,3,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Cockeysville, MD",8/27/12,2012,8,27

Diverse and cultural company to work for,While working at Walmart you work with many people of different cultures. I work with a few associates who have disabilities and walmart don't discriminate when it comes to hiring people with disabilities. which is a good thing because everyone deserve a chance. Wiorking in retail you get to know the customers and sometimes you know thiem by name and they become part of your walmart family as well. The hardest part of working at walmart is getting through the holiday season.,4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Grand Blanc, MI",8/27/12,2012,8,27
A Good Place for Part-Timers,"Overall I loved my job at Walmart. I would still be with them if there had been any positions available when I moved out to AZ. They're great for students and part-timers. Never ever go career though. I couldn't survive working full time at Walmart in Nebraska. I made less than 17,000 a year as a full time associate with almost 2 years with them. Thats before tax time too.I had fun and enjoyed working with my co-workers.Management drove me insane. Scheduling was always wrong and never enough people were scheduled. Half the time I don't think the managers understood the word planning. Never ever mention organizing to them either. They're usually very nice people but never organized as far as I can tell.The hardest part of the entire job was transitioning from a military mindset of planning and organization to complete randomness. Prioritizing was a foreign concept too.I did love my job though. I worked in the photo lab, electronics, toys, stationary, and as a cashier. Customer service was essential and I love that part of the job.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Customer Service ,"Omaha, NE",8/27/12,2012,8,27

An honest reveiw of Walmart: pro's and cons (2 years),"If you are looking for a part time job to help fund school or pay for basic necessities walmart does this well. In my experience, they are superb about working scheduling around your prior commitments such as school (though I highly suggest applying for the desired times off as early as possible to ensure that they will be granted)A typical day at work can range from interesting to tediously boring depending on what position you are placed in and how busy the day is. That being said, the wages are fair, even on the high end for positions such as cashier and electronics associate.Management: varies greatly between stores, I highly suggest to scout out the store prior to employment, a simple grocery run will usually suffice; if the store seems clean and friendly, then generally speaking, it usually means management follows suit, you can also ask the cashier, most will tell you straight forward anything you wish to know.Customer Base: While you will have a variety of customers in any retail environment it seems from my experience that Walmart has a habit of attracting painfully ignorant people at a much higher rate than many other stores, front end associates learn how to identify them on sight (or sometimes as soon as they speak). For these customers you can only do your job and hope they leave soon, but as a side note not all customers are bad; occasionally you do meet someone interesting, ex: I once had a brilliant conversation with an working Quantum Physicist on a slow day.Hardest thing about this job: getting past the boring parts, dealing with extreme stupidity and - more...",3,Former Employee,Various Positions ,"Pullman, WA",8/25/12,2012,8,25

Highly educational atmosphere and productivity on the job.,"Working at Wal-Mart is a great experience because of the diversified field of endeavour and inter-action with customers. A typical day at work would be processing digital prints of customers and giving good customer service by packaging their finished orders and selling other photo equipments like cameras, camcorders and accessories. Management, as exemplified by its founder Mr. Walton himself, caters to the needs of its associates. Most of my co-workers are like myself, wear buttons attesting to more than 5 years residence at Walmart. The hardest part of my job is complying to the needs of rude customers who are, most of the time, very unreasonable in their demands.

Life as a Walmart...,"You wake up one day early to go to work, and once there, you already want to go home just so that you can repeat the same process the next day and get it over with. You're usually busy, and you begin to see trends in customer behavior, like asking the same questions, assuming you don't understand them, and then asking for the store manager, who is almost always with another custohmer. At the end of a long work day, you stare intently at your phone, avoiding eye contact on the way out, but the moment you look up, there is a customer ready to pounce on you asking where something in housewares is, because they always ask about housewares. So you help them, even though you're off the clock, and try your hardest to get done quickly so that you don't have to go submit a time adjustment after. As you walk to your car, you look at the sunshine and remember that you haven't seen it all day, and are glad that even though you've worked hard and there is still much work to do, you don't have a job that you are allowed to take home with you.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/ Customer Service ,"Macomb, IL",8/23/12,2012,8,23

Not knowing if you will be at work for 8 hours, 10 hours, or 12 hours. You could work four 12 hour days in a row, even though you are scheduled 40 hours a week. The actually job itself is not difficult. It is mainly based off others ability and willingness to work.

It is what it is...,"Walmart employees more people than anyone in the nation. They make a genuine effort to train employees initially, but once on the job, additional training is often available only on an informal basis by seeking to have coworkers show you how to do something. Working here is something that should probably be considered a ""lilypad"" job... someplace you land and sit a while until jumping to someplace else.Go to work there with the idea in mind that you will eventually go to work somewhere else. Document your accomplishments. Ask for copies of your employee reviews. For example, if you are taught how to build displays, use the camera on your phone (when timed out) to take photos of displays you have built.Advancement is a long term thing with 5 levels between sales associate and store manager. The rewards are backloaded for making store manager. Department managers (the first level up from sales associate) rarely make more than 50 cents more per hour than sales associate. Incidentally, hourly rate of pay and annual increases are based solely on a store's operating expense classification and job description. If you excel, do so for yourself, because it will not result in any impact on compensation. You are interchangeable with other employees and are viewed as such. That is probably why annual turnover in most stores is in the 50% range",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,North Texas,8/23/12,2012,8,23

Wal-mart is a good company for a first-time employee to gain experience in customer service and working with others.,"My day would usually start out with me arriving in the parking lot and sitting in my car with a book until it was time to clock in. I'd usually be on the register for an hour or two, directing customers and cashiering, while my coworkers went about their business elsewhere in the department. The most of the managers were all quick and happy to hear a misgiving or lend a hand. Most of my coworkers were very friendly and I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job was when a young lady was hired on and got friendly with a man in upper management, and the rest of us (myself and coworkers') hours were all cut and given to her. I would end up with only four hours per week because of her, and my some of my coworkers got none at all. She had an awful attitude towards all of us and when we were finally able to have our grievance heard, she followed us to the specific office and over-spoke us in order to get her side in first. As far as I know, she still works in the same department and hasn't made any new friends due to her actions. Nasty coworkers aside, my favorite part of the job was being able to successfully help a customer with something they needed.

Management is very helpful at this company. I love everyone that I work with. They are very nice and help you out a lot with any problem to the best of their ability. The hardest part of my job would probably be all the notes that we get in the beginning of the day that need to be done during the day before we leave.

They often asked me to do things above my pay grade because they knew they could rely on me.The hardest part of my job was leaning how to communicate with people that were different from me.

"It's retail, but it's solid work","I worked at Wal Mart for 3 years at the Azle, Tx location. While it was FILLED with the typical issues that come with retail, it's job security. I'm sure it all depends on what Wal Mart you work at, but my experience at the Azle, Tx Wal Mart was decent and there are a few managers out there who DO appreciate people who stick around.

Productive work environment,"A typical work day at Wal-Mart was very interesting considering you come across all sorts of people. I got to meet friendly people to caring people to people who seemed to be off their rocker a little bit. But overall the customers are who made working at Wal-Mart worth it. I've learned a lot about being considerate and helping others because you never know why they may be the way that they are, so being helpful in anyway that I could always put a smile on their face when they came into the store not so happy. My co-workers were the most awesome bunch of people I've ever worked with, they were like my Wal-Mart family! They were always there to help when a problem came about that someone didn't know how to solve, any time they seen a co-worker not having a good day they would do anything to help make them smile. They were just AWESOME! But there were downfalls of working at Wal-Mart too. Sometimes you just get customers that are literally trying to give you a hard time to get to you for some odd reason but I had to learn to let it all go in one ear and out of the other.

Productive and management control,On a normal day at work is a busy day. Always helping customers and making sure they are enjoying their shopping at Walmart. Learning to cope with rude customers is an everyday task but knowing you are doing your job is a success. The managers are always on the look out and making sure they are around when they are needed. Having to deal with a complaint on your own from a customer is the hardest accomplishment when you do not know all the fundamentals of what is required to fulfill that task. I loved interacting with the customers and having a good conversations with them and my managers. You can always be on a personal basis with the managers and know you are not going to get judged for what you are open about.,5,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Highland Village, TX",8/21/12,2012,8,21
Its a where you meet new people but also strongly stay focused on customer service.,Walmart is a place where it shows growth in and individual and also gives you the option to be very social with the customers and also your coworker. The managers there are loving and are willing to change things in case of an family emergency and also school. The hardest part about working for Walmart I would say is having some customers that just not in a mood and very upset but I try to make them have their very best experience while shopping there. Because I am a very sociable person i would say the most enjoyable thing about working for Walmart is having the many different conversations with your customers and enjoying hearing all the different stories about their life and also sharing mines with them. My coworkers are also people that I enojy working with becasue without them the work day would go by slow and dull.,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Orlando, Fl",8/21/12,2012,8,21

I verbally appreciate people for their contributions and feel that it helps them give me their all. I encourage them to contribute to the store with how they envision things; I help make it their store. When I worked as a day manager I was primarily working with the office associate reviewing mark-up/mark-down reports, overseeing the accounting department, overseeing the personnel office as well as the front end and backroom processes. Hardest part of the job currently is the requirement of doing more with less people; teaching and staffing the store would make it a win win situation.

Walmart is a sweat shop retail environment.,"If you like working hard, not getting any raises you might like Wal-mart. The only communication with management is when someting needs to be done right away or your co workers messed something up. They like to yell at poeple in a group even if its one co worker always messing something up. They have these assistant managers that like to micomanage everything you do, if you are trained one way and they don't like it, be ready to hear about that and lean how to do things that persons way. So if you like a place that doesn't give out raises to increase store profits, Wal-mart is the place for you.

Great long term employer with growth potential,A typical work day was challenging at first but leveled off after assignments and workload was assessed. Every day was not the same; some aspects invited some forward thinking. Being on an off shift communication was critical with peers. This made the job interesting if key information was not passed along. The co workers were fun to be around with the ability to network friends that have transferred to other buildings.

I generally really like working for Walmart. I am just looking to move forward and Walmart doesn't have anything more available to me.,"On a typical day of work I am never bored. I am constantly switching tasks and multitasking which I, personally, love and excel at. I have learned how to complete tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible and how to do it all with a polite, happy, upbeat mood as to please customers as much as possible. Generally speaking I love the managers I work with I just wish to move to a more professional environment where people are treated more equally based on skills and not on favoritism. I love all the people I work with. For the most part we all get along very well. My co-workers are what makes work fun and not just a mindless task we all do. It is an excellent environment to enjoy yourself while also remaining on task and professional.

WalMart is too greedy.,"I worked in an office and had very little supervision or interaction with others. However, what I did see was poor management, understaffing, and low pay. I always loved how management knows nothing about my job, but try to tell me how to do it. They couldn't fill in if someone was sick. Our job was super important, and only three of us worked in the office. It took two people to do the job, so if one of us went on vacation, we had to work everyday since no one else was trained to help us. Other stores had a few back up trained in through out the store.There were always employees complaining about the extra work caused by smaller staff. Walmart continued to cut full time positions and replacing them with part time. (so they dont have to pay for benefits) The first time I worked for Walmart, there were three of us- two full time, and one part. I left and came back- there were two part timers and one full timer. But duties had increased, not decreased. Also, when I came back I started out $1.00 per hr lower than the first time.

Absolutely Pathetic...,"Was with the company for 13 years, every year I was there company went downhill as a place to work for. Took every benefit that associates used to get. No more Profit Sharing, no more $1 hour more on Sundays, and the bonuses are minute and unattainable.Work-life balance working for Walmart is a joke unless you live for the ""Job"" You are not required to work all 3 shifts to perform your job however it is EXPECTED of you that you do.If a family member gets sick, too bad. If you get sick... too bad. All they care about is the bottom line and store ""score cards"" even if they have to ""manipulate"" the numbers and create a poor work environment to get the job done.I started a new job and in first three days have be thanked and appreciated more than I have in the past 5 years with Walmart.The only thing I miss about working there is the people I worked with. Forget the 10% discount, get a job that actually pays you a fair wage and the 50% more you will make will make the discount obsolete.Only work at Walmart if you have completely given up.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,Pennsylvania,8/15/12,2012,8,15
A great place to work for better opportunities.,"At Wal-Mart I would ring up the cutomers' groceries, zone areas for misplaced items and spills, ansd train at various parts of the store.

I knew what was expected of me, and always knew where to go with any questions or concerns. I got along with he people I worked with and we worked as a team. The best part about the job was that I knew I was working somewhere where I was valued.

a place where managerment needs to be supervised also,"start with a meeting,useless,told what dept to go to,manager stays in office or is sleeping in opffice or trying to pick up a employee,certain employees get special jobs,certain co-worker do thier work while others get away with goffing off,talking ,using thier phones all againts company rules,some even stealing merchandise right under ma,nagerment nise,doing my job then have to help slackers,working with staff that realey do work,having a good time doing our job.",2,Former Employee,GM/Stocker ,"Centereach, NY",8/15/12,2012,8,15

A little cold never hurt anybody,"A typical day working in the dairy section of a Walmart Super Center included receiving 2 different shipments of milk, a third shipment of ""other"" goods like yogurt and juice, reorganizing the cooler to fit the new shipment and rotate the out dated stock out of the cooler. Flexibility is a must because all similar sections (ie Dairy, Frozen, Grocery, etc) must cover for each other when short on people or are backed up on tasks. This helped develop professional bonds and improve work performance despite some of the management decisions to pull from an already short handed department.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Independence, MO",8/15/12,2012,8,15

Productive and Hard Work,"When you are working in the front-end of the store. It is very important of the impact you have with your customers. We work hard to keep our customers happy, but the popularity of this store kept us pretty much busy.

Typical Night At Walmart,"Every night we start off with a meeting to let us know how much product was sold throughout the day. Then the manager lets us know what area(s) we'll be working in for the night and how much time it should take to finish. We grab a pallet jack and get our freight via department and separate according to aisle; then start stocking as neatly as possible. The manager comes around every once in a while to check on the flow of things so they'll know if we'll need help by the end of the night. From the beginning I told them I wanted to learn as much as possible in every area. I learned how to use the inventory scanner, how to do picks, and how to back-stock. Although all of the co-workers we're not so easy to get along with, they never knew because I was the same ""nice person"" to everybody. Overall my co-workers we're nice and very helpful and supportive.

A great atmosphere to work in,"A typical day at walmart is you never know what you are going to come across, You never know what a person is going thru so you have to be on your toes at all times. You might have the nicest customer then the person right behind her/him could be the nastiest and most rude person you may come in contact with. Being that i have been in this field for almost five years now i have learned how to smile and not take it personally. You never know what a person is going thru they probably just lost their job and are worried how they are going to feed their family. They might have just had a death in their family anything could have happen so you just learn not to take it personal and if you can put a smile on their face before they leave your presence and let them know you understand what they are going thru.",5,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Brandon, Fl",8/14/12,2012,8,14

Productive and fun environment,"A typical day at work I would clock in and cash out customers' purchases and keep my register tidy. I would take a 15 minute break the first and last two hours of my shift and inbetween those breaks I would take a hour lunch. I learned to humble myself because there are some rude people in this world. Management was okay, at times we disagreed, but it was nothing intense. My co-workres were so friendly and I enjoyed thier company. The hardest part of the job is ""the customer is always right!""

I have enjoyed working at Walmart,"A typical day at Wal-Mart started out with lining out the day, Employees and daily job requirments to put things in perspective to the amount of time everything needed to be done in. Orders and required counts were done, displays zoned and filled for the morning, Touch base with your asscociates what needed to be done and when on a timly basis. Reciving the notes upper management gave out and completed them as soon as possible not to exceed noon. Continuie stocking what mechandise needed last possitions was over produce so I was constintly refilling tables and refridgerated wall. Supervizing all employees though the day on their jobs like breaking down pallets, stocking, cleaning, and modular sets.Follow up with employees that jobs were done on time and left notes to the other two shifts that you would not see much of but still need to comunicate what need to be done.I have learned so much working here and have enjoyed my fellow employees.

A great place to work depending on location and management,I met alot of wonderful people that have since left the store due to one issue or another.Alot of the problems had to do with the way that those in management positions handled issues that arose between workers. Also a few needed sensitivity training and more time learning the departments in which they were in charge of running.The hardest part was training associates and then having them leave for issues that could have been resolved.The most enjoyable is all the different personalities and seeing how they interact with each other or pull together to accomplish a common goal.I learned that you can have fun at work and that people are willing to do their jobs but no one wants to be talked down to or belittled.We are all adults and should be treated and respected as such.,3,Former Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Mount Pleasant, SC",8/14/12,2012,8,14

No comunication,Getting the machine ready to mop and wax the floor. sweep the floor before machine was used picking up product as i go.I learned how to use a buffer and scruber and what it takes to clean a retail store of that size.Management did a ok for the most part seemed a bit under trained in areas and a bit lost most of the time with the proper training in all aspecs of the store as well as emplimenting a customer fist style over task only would help the store go far.

Always busy but not as challenging.,"On a typical day at work, I put out freight to the floor and direct other scheduled associates to their tasks. Once the floor is filled, the momemtum shifts to the cooler in the backroom where we put the rest of the freight away in a neat and orderly fashion. I work on price changes, look at reports, change modulars, direct associates to other tasks that need to be done. Review notes given by management and prioritize them, delegate and make sure those tasks are accomplished. I have learned to be a leader, fair but firm. Have high expectations of myself and lead by example. I learned to do things orderly and neat, while managing the time given for best production. For the most part, management has been there supporting me when needed, but sometimes the communication is lacking. I have a great group of co-workers and they help me get the job done. The hardest part of the job is correcting an associate when things aren't done to expectations.

Wasnt really an inspiring place for Me,"My typical day at work required me to report to my department n to see what my department manager had on her ""to-do"" list for me. If our department was up to date at the time, we were required to assist the rest of the store. While working at Walmart I learned a lot about customer service and inventory management. One of my daily duties was to uphold the inventory of the department. I also learned how to work with multiple tasks in one day. As far as Management, I'm pretty sure this applies everywhere but there were some good one's and some bad one's. Co-workers were a little hard to deal with but i stayed out of the mist of the gossip and kept to myself while still interacting with others in a productive manner. The hardest part of the job was miscommunication. Multiple managers could ask you to do many tasks without acknowledgement of the others(nor concern sometimes). This sometimes made me look bad as an employee just following instructions. But my most enjoyable part of the job would have to be seeing certain associates and customers. They can really uplift and lighten a mood sometimes.",2,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Glenmont, NY",8/14/12,2012,8,14

High-paced environment lots of stress.,"You walk into work and clock in. Wait patiently near the key box for management to give you the keys for a CSM. You walk to the front of the store, however on the way you will be asked where an obscure item is located by a customer. You find the item by actually looking for it because you work on the front end and do not know where magnetic poster borders are located. When you get to the front end you will be approached by a manager who will inquire as to why the lines are so long. Telling them of your recent arrival on the scene won't help so you just say that you will fix it. Pull associates from other areas to check. They take a minimum of five minutes to arrive at a register despite the short distance. You will receive a call from management asking why you are using associates on registers when there is no line. You send those associates back to their departments. Prepare for angry customers to ask you ""why walmart has all of these registers and no cashiers"" which happens daily, and you tend to ask yourself the same question. Be ready to send four breaks per hour despite only having six cashiers, and be further ready for cashiers to take double their allotted break time to return to their register. Be prepared for customers to be attempting to return stolen merchandise at the service desk constantly, and also be ready to approve such returns as long as they provide a valid drivers license. Beyond all be ready to tip-toe around what you say to people despite their blatant disregard for walmart employees because they do not believe that checkouts should have lines.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Jackson, MO : Desloge, MO",8/14/12,2012,8,14
Wal-Mart Review,"I worked at Wal-Mart for about six months, and I acquired several life time friends. There was no typical day at work. Never knew what hours you would be working until you printed your schedule. Worked from 5 pm-2 am several times, and still had to return to work and work until the next morning. Also would work until 12 am, and have to return at 7 am. Lived approximately 45 minutes away, and it became rough to not be able to sleep and have to be back in at work in less than six hours. Some of the co-workers were amazing to work with, while others had attitude over everything. If I ever had a bad day, it was not due to a rude, hateful customer, it was always over a rude, hateful co-worker. Because I was a cashier, I was told to return several things to the freezer section because customers no longer wanted the item(s). The Customer Service Manager would ask me to return them, and I would. When I was in the process of doing so, I was literally yelled at, and ""talked to like a dog"" over doing what I was told. Confronting the CSM about it, I was told just to ignore it. I was jumped onto several times over another person's mistake as well. The customers were the most enjoyable part. You would be amazed at how much you learn/hear when they come through your line. If given the opportunity again, I would not return to work for Wal-Mart because management shows no respect to the people that work for them. As previously stated, they are rude, snotty, hateful, and inconsiderate individuals.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Galax, VA",8/13/12,2012,8,13

Enjoyable work atmosphere,At Wal-Mart the employees and Management were always smiling and trying to make the work environment pleasant. There were no real personal issues between employees.

Make sure all cashiers have the necessary utensils needed to complete their shift as well as enough change to keep their work more steady and quicker. I learned that we have a responsibility to make sure the customer is happy no matter what. Being apart of the management team gave me the insight to understand that your employees feed off of the vibe you give off if you are negative they will be negative, if you have an attitude they tend to have one. The hardest part is making sure everyone is following policy and making sure the customer is satisfied.

rewarding career working with the customers,"in all fairness i understand the need to place guidelines for walmarts associates when it comes to stocking the freight, but a computer generates a time based on how much freight an area is given and the associate in that assigned area is expected to meet that time. in my experience the amount of freight versus the time does not match up and never has. so i was terminated for not being productive enough. i had 2 areas to do and 2 hours in both areas and at least 8 pallets of freight all together for both areas, one of which had 4 pallets that stood as tall as me and im 6'0. management when told about this never really offered a reasonable explanation for the untimed freight. they just would tell you that the times were right and that you needed to work faster. i learned alot about the reatail side of business and i loved the fact that just by finding a customer a certain product that was out of stock on the shelves could really make their day",3,Former Employee,3rd Shift Stocker ,"Martinsville, VA",8/13/12,2012,8,13

Hard Work - Few Rewards,"Unless you are a full time Associate you have very few rewards. You do get a Wal-mart discount card after working there for 90 days. But this card only works on certain items and most of those items are junk food and non consumables. Typically there are several other associates working at the same time. Although it says that wasting time (i.e. standing around doing nothing or just talking instead of working) is against store policy, I see it every day. I work very hard and make sure I get as much as I can done in the time that has been given to me. I don't get treated any different than the associates that don't finish their tasks and wander off to talk to other associates.

Wal-Mart,"Walmart is a very fun and enjoyable job. I attend a regular team meeting at 10:00 pm when I clock in and after the meeting it's time to go stock the shelves. After the shelves are stocked to capacity I clean my aisle and check with management before going home. I've learned a lot from Walmart; especially concerning customer service. I'm now a more efficient worker with a more positive work attitude. I've also learned the importance of customer care because at the end of the day it's the customers that pay me. Management is good and makes it easy to work with them.

The hardest part of this job was dealing with customers who got impatient or were just unsatisfiable.

Or it could be so full of employees everything would be done early.What I learned at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc was that customer service is important. Displease a customer and they won't come back. But make a customer very happy and they come back and make a point to see you or ask for you when they need help, etc. I also learned time management. Especially during those mornings while there was no one but you to start up the bakery.The Management of Wal-Mart is one that I would call confusing. You have 50 managers, all lined up, that ask you to do particular jobs. Which isn't a problem, except when one says to do one thing the other says not to. Because I believe the communication between managers was poorly handled, it could be quite confusing.I enjoyed meeting all my co-workers. I even made a few friends between them. Every one of my co-workers were hard workers, many had the same opinions I hold, but do enjoy working at Wal-Mart as I had done.The hardest part of the job was the miscommuncation between managers and employees. It was confusing and made everyone frustrated. Other than the mornings of nobody but you when there were supposed to be 5 or more, the miscommuncation was most difficult.The easiest part was being with the customers. Taking orders, talking on the phone, getting them products, helping them find things, - more...",2,Former Employee,Baker ,"Longview, WA",8/8/12,2012,8,8

Fun place to work with room for promotions,"I really like working for WalMart. While there a few aspects of it that I don't agree with, overall it's a good company. My co-workers are the best. We always have fun working together and we really are a team. I've worked on the front end as a cashier and customer service associate, but my favorite position is in IMS; Inventory Management Systems. I've learned so much about how the store works from receiving freight to getting overstock out onto the floor to keeping track of what we have in stock. I've learned so much about the screens on our Telxon and how everything we do effects the store. My assistant manager is so supportive and she works just as hard as we do. She lets us know when we're doing a good job and is always there to help us improve our work. My co-workers and I are very close. We rely on each other to get the job done and we help each other in every way we can. The hardest part of my job is making sure that we have all of our work done in a timely manner. We only have so many hours to get all of the picks, counts, audits done and we are scored on them everyday for a weekly percentage. Sometimes it's stressful, but the reward of getting good scores makes it all worthwhile.",4,Current Employee,Inventory Associate ,"Waterford, CT",8/8/12,2012,8,8

Review,I work at a very busy pharmacy which requires ability to cope with stressful situations at fast pace but maintaining accuracy. Every day was challenging because you never know what customer situation you may encounter. Insurance problems must be handled tactfully and in an effiecent manner to keep customers happy.

Department Manager Duties,"Everyday there are notes that need to be taken care of. Weekly notes. Price changes,scanning outs and ordering merchandise daily. Making sure. On-hands and negative on-hands are correct. If have enough people in your department or not. They want however many pallets of freight that you have gone. Most of my co-workers were great to work with. One of my problems with management was that I basically begged them for training. So that I could properly do my job. I feel like they set me up to fail. That really hurt me. I was with the company for twelve years same store. I never changed locations. It took me nine years to finally want to move up. To be treated like that didn't feel good at all. I didn't want any kind of Appreciation, of coarse. Everyone wants to feel appreciated. Just know that I could do my job and do it well. Was all that I wanted. I enjoyed and loved my job. It was overwhelming at times. I begged for more people in the department, due to the fact that it was understaffed.

High-traffic work environment with many different tasks.,"My workdays at Wal-Mart would consist of assisting customers (both in person and over the phone), being knowledgeable about computers, televisions, & other types of electronics, heavy lifting, setting modulars, keeping merchandise zoned, and using a cash register. I learned a great deal about electronic devices and about working with people. Management was good for the most part, but there are some managers who show unfair treatment towards some associates. My coworkers consisted partly of friendly people who did their jobs well, but there were some who had very poor attitudes and work ethics. The hardest part of the job is working with those certain people who have negative attitudes and seemingly personal problems with me. The most enjoyable part of the job (for me personally) is working with the video games, making sure all the new games are out and staying up to date on future game releases.",3,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Starkville, MS",8/7/12,2012,8,7

It was a great experience.There are times where it was so busy that we were running and wondering where all the people came from. But we worked together and pulled it off.Management was the best group I have ever worked with. They were compassionate and treated you real. They didn't treat you like you weren't important and they worked right along with you.The hardest part of the job would actually be the few customers that seemed to never be happy. There was even one that had copies of pictures made and was furious because we needed a release from the photographer before we could release them to him.

Good place to work--hard to advance to higher levels of mgmt.,"I have worked for WalMart for almost 11 years. In that time I have seen them take away employee incentives right and left. Sometimes it seems they do not care about their employees. The managers seem to coach their associates for things that others have done.

This is the absolute worst company to work for EVER.,The only thing I liked about working here was my co-workers it is a very cut throat company they could care less about there employees thats why it's such a high turn over rate.There a multi billion dollar company that refuses to make anyone full time so they dont have to pay for full benifits the wages are extremely low for all the hard work thats expected to be done.You dont get any personal time for a year and then you only get 14 hours once you hit a year. If your deathly sick in the hospital even with a doctors note if you miss more than 4 days you can forget about your job.Management is steady changing and none of them are proffessional the list goes on and on the worst company I have worked for by far they don't deserve one star it's thumbs down all across the board for me and I know im not alone.,1,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Henderson, NV",8/7/12,2012,8,7
Fun yet demanding,"If you love to meet new people and make friends, than this is the job for you. I had a great time working with my coworkers and some cutomer service managers. However, the job can be very demanding, especially on your physical body. Be sure to expect aches and pains especially in the soles of your feet and your lower back in case you are not already used to it. A good way secure your job is to always be available. Although that is not always possible as some people actually want to live a portion of their lives outside of those walls. And if you don't mind having an angry customer yell at you as if you stole their baby, then you should try it out. As they would tell you, the customer is not mad at you, they are just mad. Through it all, the job can be very rewarding if you are a grounded person who loves to make people smile. Gotta love it. You will never have a boring day.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Alpharetta, GA",8/7/12,2012,8,7

Management does not pay attention to you unless you mess up or cause trouble. some coworkers are awesome and up beat while others are lazy, bitter, rude and hate their jobs. Coworkers from all different backgrounds make it interesting and fun.. Hardest part of the job is the customers. They look down on you and treat you like dirt. At my location I can expect to get called names or screamed at almost daily. Most customers are very nice, some are not and want to pick fights and get you fired.

"A LOT of responsibility, decent pay, salaried, no personal life.","It is hard to say many good things about this position. It is pretty unforgiving and rarely rewarding.

No set weekends and plans for your personal life go to the way-side. I was lucky to have an amazing Store Manager, but that is about it on the great things I have to say about my experience. If you are young and pretty (nevermind smart, capable and having a great resume) it will take a while for other management and associates to come to like you.Over-all you must be driven to do well in this position and have a great amount of knowledge about the retail world - AND be passionate about it.

Horrible!!,Walmart makes you think that your lucky to have gotten a job with them and that you can make it into a career and move up and its all lies. Their scheduling is horrible!! I had nights where i got out at midnight and had to be back at work at 7am. 1 day you'll work late nights the next day early in the morning the following day midday for 4 hrs (waste of gas) The cashiers are treating like they're dirt. They forget to give you your breaks. When I tried to move to another dept. they wouldnt let me even though i qualified and had started training they even started writing me up for bogus stuff just so i'd be ineligible for advancement for 6 months. The managers act like they're the popular kids in h.s. instead of acting professional. The pay isnt great either especially from a big chain like that.

They squeezed me out.,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Millington, TN",8/6/12,2012,8,6
Great Culture - Not So Great Benefits/Pay,"I learned a tremendous amount while working at Wal-Mart. I had the opportunity to get involved with various activities on the Corporate campus in addition to my day job.The culture is great and something you can get behind if you choose to ignore some individuals that can't seem to understand it. There were several employees that came from other companies that couldn't quite figure out or adjust to the Every Day Low Price mindset of the company.Pay is not great for internals and there are minimal opportunities to advance quickly unless you came from another company to Wal-Mart. There is a fairly large number of employees that willingly leave Wal-Mart to work for another company knowing they will come back to Wal-Mart b/c they negotiate a higher rate of pay if they become ""externals."" This tends to lower moral of individuals hoping to move up the ranks in Wal-Mart. It can be done - but in terms of doing it for better pay, you may have to wait much longer than if you had never worked for the company or if you had left and came back.Be prepared to work hard, but know that your hard work is making a difference. The company benefits many low income families.Interaction with all levels of employees is/can be high, even up to the CEO. Even hourly employees have carte blanche to schedule time to meet with executives and the CEO.

It's walmart....,"One becomes aware that as an individual, they are being slowly used up with the company's willingness to discard after being burned up/out. Medical insurance is a sorry excuse for such. Values are good, though not ""stuck"" to. It is all about appearances. Job security is precarious to say the least. Advancement opportunities are good, though the three step coaching process can be crippling and is often used by the company to weed out those they simply don't ""like"". There are few to no kudos/rewards that are merit based. Management is not in your corner, they are simply looking to keep their OWN jobs, and who can blame them.

I would then go to the register assigned, and put the money the managers had placed in the cash drawer into the correct slots, after that I would turn on my light and ask customers in longer lines if they would like to come into my line. After asking them how their day was I would start to check out their items by running them over the scanner, using the hand scanner for larger items, or typing in the UPC for items such as fruits or items the machine could not read. While having a conversation with my customer I would ask them for any coupons after entering them, the machine would total the amount they owed and I would annouce to them the total due. After receiving their method as payment, such as a debit card transaction, a credit card transaction, Food Stamp payment, or a cash payment. I would give any cash owed to them, and wish that they have a nice day and to come back to Walmart soon.

Terrible management and unethical work demands.,The management at Wal-mart was horrible. The only real manager was the store manager and if it wasn't done his way you would be fired. A typical day of work for me was getting 3 departments worth of stock to do while others generally had 1-2.I learned that being the biggest person in Wal-mart was a bad thing because I'd be required to lift the heaviest objects with little to no help.

mgmt does not care,mgmt does not provide adequate personal for productive customer service.

Wal-mart doesn't care.,"Wal-mart employee experience differs from store to store but in general not many are fun. From what I experienced I saw a huge, almost war like, gap between associates and management. Every system in place was broken and horribly disorganized, things would come out of the back of the store only to be sent back in the same night which only led to mass confusion. Management refused to arrange proper training for me even after asked for is several times and I only learned how to do my job by people yelling at me.I'm sure there's people out there that actually enjoy their work with the company but for me the cons heavily outweighed the pro, then again the store I worked for is one of the worst in the state. It's a miracle it's even still open since people are actually driving the extra distance to go to better stores.",1,Former Employee,Night Shift Grocery Stocker ,Central LA,7/31/12,2012,7,31

Decent Entry Level Job - Low Pay,"Unfortunately the benefits and pay are not that great at Wal-Mart, but having benefits such as insurance and vacation time are better than nothing. The typical work day is usually very busy, at least in the pharmacy. I've learned a lot about pharmaceuticals, insurance policies, HIPPA, and how to deal with irate customers. The management leaves lots to be desired. Management at Wal-mart isn't very hands on, which gives the impression that they don't care leaving employees with the ""well then why should I care?"" attitude. The hardest part of the job is working in a small space with stressed out employees and customers.

Challenging work environment that promotes change.,"Walmart is a full in-line General Merchandise and Grocery store. High pace work load where your day begins and ends with more to do than daylight to do it. Great thing about Walmart is you have work to do the next day you are scheduled. The management team is as good as the associates that work in the facility. My experience over the past 22 years is the best management team is those that have grown up in Walmart.The hardest part of doing your job is all the freight that comes in, the volume of the business, and the call-ins that come from less dedicated associates.The most enjoyable part of working for Walmart is the people you work with.",3,Former Employee,Store Director of Operations ,"Plano, TX",7/31/12,2012,7,31

Retail Store Associate,"As an Associate at Walmart, my responsiblilities were mainly customer service and finding where mercandise would be best fit for a sale. I learned how to capture a customer just browsing, and how to organize merchandise. The hardest part about my job was that I would stand for hours without a chance to sit, it became annoying. The best thing about the job was the customers who was very diverse, young and old, and many foreigners would come in also.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Chesterfield, VA",7/31/12,2012,7,31
Great Prices + Great Value + Great Staff = Great Company!,"A lot of Wal-Mart stores are now open 24/7, which means, you will need more staff to accomodate the store's needs. However, having a store open for 24 hours means, constant staff working, which can be a little overwhelming for even customers to witness. Thus to be said, having items constantly stocked is promoting great customer service. Having a great company doesn't just simply detail profits but also includes; feedback from staff and management. Depending on how management treats you will determine how staff may view their feedback on working for Wal-Mart. It can be tiring to work long hours however if you enjoy working in a specific department, the hours may go fast. It all depends on each staff member's viewpoint. With that said, I enjoyed working with staff and management and I had a good time interacting with customers as well.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Kissimmee, FL",7/31/12,2012,7,31

The most enjoyable part is making people smile and helping out.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Alabaster, AL",7/31/12,2012,7,31
An ok place to work but boring,When I would get to work I would clock in and go stright to the register were I would stay until time for break or lunch then go right back.

The hardest part was doing the samething over and over again The most enjoyable was working with the public.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Dothan, AL",7/31/12,2012,7,31
Great opportunity to excel in retail,"Wal-Mart is a large company but every store is different in their values and in their management. A person will never go to one store and have the same routine or the same settings it's always different. Some stores are better than some and some are worse than others. Going to work I would never know one day to the next what I would be doing, it always varied. My title was CSM and I would be helping unload a truck that night or helping with inventory. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers and employees, they were a wide range of carismatic and sensible people. There was probably one or two managers that I actually respected and that was because they took their time to teach and give knowledge and carefully handle situations, the others were too quick to jump and not think and that to me is a huge flaw.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,McDonough,7/31/12,2012,7,31
fun people,"Wal mart was a good company to work for. I worked in the backroom with 4 other people, trying to make everything organized so that the department managers could easily access their products and so that the store would be ready when inventory came around. My co-workers were great and management was around to let us know what needed to be done for the day and pretty much left us alone. The hardest part of the job was trying to stock shelves with the aisles filled with customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was on the days when we just cleaned up the whole backroom and made alot of progress. A very productive day made me feel real good. My absolute favorite day was when we got to unload the trucks at the end of the day though. It was hard work and fast paced!",3,Former Employee,inventory control specialist ,"Bristol, CT",7/31/12,2012,7,31
Overall Life with Wal-Mart,"The pay was great compared to most retail companies but with the load of work we would be doing, wasn't worth the pay. I loved working with the customers and the other employees, I enjoy helping people when I can and getting to know new people. I have worked every shift with Wal-Mart and it is a very stressful environment, you are expected to do up to 8 tasks at once, it may seem impossible but somehow we as a team at Wal-Mart are able to get it done but it does take it's toll with your body. I do enjoy the challenges at Wal-Mart and I do love to keep myself busy with the work.",3,Former Employee,Instock Associate ,"Elverson, PA",7/31/12,2012,7,31
management and fairness,"This Walmart has alot of management issues and it falls onto the employees. There is a ""Click"" at this Walmart and I don't work well in conditions like that. They schedule you with weird shifts to make sure you can't work a second job if you need to. With the economy the way it is, if you can find a second job to make ends meet you should be able to do so. Walmart will not let you work more than 32 or so hours but not 40 and the pay is below standards for that type of work. Walmart needs alot of improvements done with management.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Port Charlotte, FL",7/31/12,2012,7,31

Satisfactory but Room for Improvement,"Typical day includes clocking in, zoning, loading/unloading rocket carts, and dealing with customers (good and bad; many seem to find a reason to complain, yell at the cashier or other associates, as well as do anything they can get to a freebie).Customers come in regularly to save money to using competitor ads. Home office no longer requires them to bring in the ad (occasionally some are at the register) so more often than not, associates/cashiers have to take the customer's word about the advertised price. Many seem too good to be true. If the associate and CSM(s) are dedicated enough to prove the ad, stores will be called or the ads will be hunted down. If neither is available, their word is typically taken the they're given the supposed advertised price.The discount is okay. It doesn't work on a lot of groceries, which is the main reason this cashier applied for a job with this company in the first place. The discount on everything (including groceries) is only during the holidays.Also, associates are not paid enough to deal with getting yelled at by customers when the associates is not at fault for whatever the problem is. There have been many days when this associate has wanted to lash out against that customer or just walk away never to return.The health benefits are okay. Vision and dental would be a great addition, not to mention employees (full- and part-time) being eligible for benefits after 90 days. Many other companies offer these valuable benefits within 90 days; why not this one?An associate can have open availability and get 24 hours during the workweek. - more...",3,Current Employee,Associate ,Texas,7/31/12,2012,7,31

"The workplace is acceptable, however management is substandard.","I learned that at wal-mart it is more important to ""make friends"" with your immediate management than it is to complete your job to the best of your abilities. After working for the company for 4 years as a department manager I found the overall goals to be un-realistic and expectations beyond reach. For instance, the weekend shift is supposed to organize(zone) and stock the department. On Monday mornings, the beginning of my week, I would receive a department walk through. I would be criticized for the state the department was in and marked down for it. Another instance involved and update of a area within my department. I had cleared the entire day to get the area done, but found that members of management would pull me from the task. Towards the end of the day I was pulled by another member of management. I informed that manager that I would not be able to complete the task if pulled. I was informed that that was ok.

There's truly CLICKS at Wal-Mart. There was multiple personalities and you just don't know what or who they are or even how to deal with them at times. I like Wal-Mart because it gets very busy. Managers that acknowledge only managers and not even speak or acknowledge anyone else was very obvious. CSM forget to give you a break but everyone else around gets a break.

They do not appreciate the work that their associates do, and all of the associates always complain about their job, and all of the problems within the store that are never worked on or changed.

I always liked to give them a good laugh and put them in a good/better mood.The hardest part of my job was dealing with the management that falsely glorify values that they do not uphold, such as doing everything to assist the customers and help them to enjoy their shopping experience, and leave the store happy thinking to themselves, ""I like shopping here"".

"A Soul-Crushing, Terrible Place to Work.","You are just a number here. No amount of name tags, ""pizza parties"", or pins of appreciation can cover up the abuse and forced gratefulness Walmart issues to their workers. You are nothing but another cog that can be easily replaced by this company.Walmart will cut your hours, without notice, for any reason. They also LOVE to make three people do the work of ten on a regular basis. If you need a manager to help you (since many tasks require management approval), good luck; they also keep them understaffed and over-worked, and it could be a while until you get the help you need. Especially if you work in the front of the store, that means you'll take the brunt of the customers' angry complaints.There was a department manager who received a $30,000 bonus for cutting his workers' hours, and he used that bonus to buy himself a motorcycle. How shameful - most of the hourly workers don't even make that much in a year. That money was supposed to help the workers pay their bills, but Corporate encouraged him to siphoned it away, simply so he can buy himself a new toy and so that Corporate could rake in record-profits using what is essentially slave labor.I worked in the Lingerie section (which was easily torn apart) on Thursday-Sunday nights (the busiest times), by myself, and I was pulled to other short-staffed departments regularly to help out. By the time I got back to Lingerie, it was time to go; yet I still had a cart full of re-shops to put away.

Once the new management came in all of that came to a halt and productivity quickly declined. Benefits went away and so did all of the extra incentives that made employees actually care to work.

It's a Walmart-thing,"A typical day consisted of putting back together the store. I learned many lessons here. It is a great way to get INTO retail and then leave after lessons are learned. This place is not for the young. Management (salary) was, malevolent. If there was a benelovent member of management, they were not there long and was fired for a rediculous reason. They would help you if they feel like it and then punish you for taking the help. Co-workers are what get you through the shifts. If you help them, they'll help you. It's a team building enviroment.

If they needed help with training or selling an item, I was there to give them a hand. The hardest part of the job was returns by customers.

Co-workers were fun to work with.,I was expected to do whatever management wanted me to do even if the restrooms needed to be cleaned. Management rules your day for you. Your normal daily tasks almost always has to wait for what management wants done first. They have time limits on everything you do. If you don't get it done on time you get wrote up. The lack of communication is one of the major problems with this company. I feel that respect for the individual does not apply for and to certain individuals. The best part was working with the customers and my co-workers.,2,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Leavenworth, KS",7/25/12,2012,7,25

"not up to date/ bad benefits/pay, no professionalism","I have worked at several different pharmacies as a technician and this one by far is the least up to date in its technology. The RX program is extremely primitive compared to CVS or Safeway and I was really surprised. However, because it has a sister program for check out, there is a very low chance of a prescription getting lost in limbo compared to the other pharmacies.They pay is very low for an experienced technician and you do not get benefits until after a year! Only 10 percent discount after 90 days of employment! AND, they make you wear what all the other sales associates wear; no professional technician lab coats. Only the pharmacist can wear one! I have never seen that in any other pharmacy.",4,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Fairfield, CA",7/25/12,2012,7,25

A fun place to work.,It was a good place to work. It made you feel great to come into work and everyone greets you with a smile and says HI. It was a job that let you meet new people and to have the customer come up to you and tell you that they have gave the door greeter or the manager good complements about me. I hate to say it but the managers there were not communicating with the cashiers at all that well. They would wait until the cashier would do something to tell them of rule changes after it was done without letting the cashiers know beforehand. Shoppers were most of the time friendly. I don't really recall of anything really being hard at this job.

Working at Walmart,"A typical day at walmart would to stock all new merchandise that has come to the store within the last 24 hours. After everything is fully out and ready to go, everyone woukd then 'zone.' Zoning is when you go in every ile and make sure that everything is close to the front so that if a customer walks by then it will stand out to them. I learned how to give customer service. Now that i know how it feels to be both the customer and servicer i know what to expect on both ends. The management was strick. It keeps you informed on all information of the store, on how much money the store made, customer accidents, etc. The co-workers in there were easy to get along with because everyone would help each other out to get the job if needed. The hardest part of the job is stocking heavy objects by yourself such as if it werent as many people at the job that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people of curse and after all the hardwork was done you were able to take two 30 minute breaks and one hour break.

"A balanced work place, but needs a few tweaks.","Walmart as a work place (My store, at least) can tend to be..... disorganized.

I/E; An Electronics Associate can sometimes be found stocking groceries.All-in-all, my co-workers were great. A pretty friendly bunch.Certain members of management can tend to play favorites, and if you don't fall in that group of favorites, well, it's bad times for you.

The company does not give proper training for its associates.,"A typical day would start with zoning my area, checking for pricing errors, stolen goods packaging, and things needing to be sent to claims. My main job was to sell licensing for hunting, fishing, and recreational areas for the State of Kansas. My direct manager was very knowledgeable about his department and the company in general.

over worked for little pay,"Well I worked hard every day since the beginning as i do in every job I work for. I was given the chance to move up in the company quite quickly, it only took me 6 months to become a Zone Merchandise Supervisor. After i got the position there was no training at all, even though they knew that I had no experience in retail. I learned quickly and over came the hardships of the position. It was hard to learn how to ""merchandise"" and learn all the company policy's with no experience in this field. After i taught myself how to do my new job, they expected me to do others jobs as well. I did not complain at all and just did it. I thought what I was doing would become noticed and I would be given the chance to move up in the company again after 2 1/2 years of doing this. Just so all of you know I was only making 1/2 of what others in the same position was making. Instead I was fired because with everything that they had wanted me to do i was not able to get all the deleted and non-replenish able items out of the stock room by the dead line that was given to me. This was the first time that I was not able to do what was asked of me. I was able to accomplish 75% of the task but I only have a 12' area to put all the merchandise that was required out. Wal-Mart is not the company they say that they are for a career. I wasted 3 years of my life on this company even though I have 8 years experience in the machining trade. I took a chance on Wal-Mart and it is not a company that you go to if you are looking for a career.",3,Former Employee,Merchandising Supervisor ,"Las Vegas, NV",7/20/12,2012,7,20

working there,"I learned that you can never not simle helping customers,and the other co-workers where so nice and helpful made it felt like home. the hardest part was just making sure you where doing everything right.

Productive fast pace work,"As a cashier, you have a lot of responsibilities. you are required to run the cash register, stock the bag racks, and candy racks, handle returns, restock the returns in their proper areas, if something isn't ringing up right, call the department it came from and get the price checked out for the customer. Then you have to apologize to the customer if the price they want doesn't match the actual price that is ringing up. Then if you don't have customers you have to organize the clothing displays in the front of the front-end of the store. Basically, you have to stay busy and not get caught not working and talking too much. This job can be very stressful at times. It all depends on your perspective of this job.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"New Ulm, MN",7/20/12,2012,7,20
Quite a mix,"I did whatever needed to be done- usually stocking, customer service, setting mods and building displays, and occasionally cashiering.I learned a lot about customer service- what people do and do not want to hear, how to handle problems with customers, and how to handle certain cleaning and safety procedures.Management varied wildly. Most of them were hard working, many of them were friendly, helpful, and informative. Some of them were awful- one of them threatened my job if I didn't stay late, another refused to move a shift that I was unavailable for due to school, and another claimed clocked out and made me finish their work, and told everyone that she did the work. Overall, most were good though.My co-workers were awesome people. Some of them were lazy, but most did their part and were great people.The hardest part of the job was sorting through what different managers tell you to do. Often, there will be 4 managers giving you a couple hours of work each, but only 6 hours left in your shift.The most enjoyable part was the work.

Challenging and often interesting place to work,"Walmart is the kind of work place where you walk into work and never know what kind of day its going to be. Its a constantly changing atmosphere, esspecially working in customer service where its absolutely vital to find a balance between company policy and customer satisfaction. One of the best lessons that I've taken away from Walmart has been to be willing to accept new challenges, and don't be afraid to seek out answers to questions that are vital to preforming the job efficiantly.One of the hardest part of working with Walmart is, unfortunately, the occasional lack of communication between management and employees. Certain things that we need to know in order to do our jobs the way they want them to be done don't reach us until a week after the new policy or procedure has been implimented. This causes a lot of confusion and lack of faith in management.For all the challenges that come with this job I love when I come away from a difficult interaction with a customer knowing that I made them happy while still managing to keep within the guidlines of the companys interests.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/CustomerService/AccountingOffice ,"Lodi, CA",7/19/12,2012,7,19

Each day there was new training modulars and sales plans to make.Lets not forget helping the cutomers aways comes first.I enjoyed being the go to trainer for the new employees.Most items are pre purchased for your department but I was able to contact an authorized vendor for Wal-mart and order High School athletic apparell. This resulted in increased sales for my department. The other softline departments followed the nexted year and the results were great.

Felt Underappreciated,"I was on time every day to work, and frequently stayed late as well. After the nightly meeting I would find out what department I had been shuffled off to that night, as I had been informed by other employees Walmart has a tendancy to ""through you into the deep end"" with little to no training in a given department. Such was the case when I was put in the electronics department alone without having even been trained to operate the register. I would work hard every night and complete me assignments ahead of schedule most of the time, but never felt like what I did mattered to anyone else in the store, certainly not management.

Either the customers, coworkers, or managers have said something to upset you.I've learned that being at walmart you have to give it your all. Being able to help a customer out, or helping a customer in anyway makes you feel good about yourself. Just the feeling of knowing that you can make another person day better, even if that means that your not having one, makes you feel a little better.The management, however, wasn't as organized as they could've been.

Great people to work with! Too many managers and would sometimes get conflicting orders.,"I unloaded trucks at Walmart for about a year. I liked the job, it was hard work and we went through people fast because of it. The problem with the job was the managers and that was it. We would start out the day unloading a general merchandise truck, which doesnt come on pallets so we have to throw each box onto a line to sort them by hand. We would get trucks that would have 2000-3000 boxes on them. It would usually take us about 2 hours depending on how well stacked the boxes are and the size of the truck. No matter what the managers would be back there every 10 minutes telling us to speed up. It also would not always be the same manager. We would then have to pull all the pallets to the floor that we just re stacked by department numbers plus unload any of the other trucks that make their way that night. They push us to get this done supper fast so we can spend the rest of the night stocking shelves to make it easier on the 3rd shift manager. The year i worked there only one other person other than me gave their two weeks notice the others, which we went through a ton of people, just walked out or a couple were fired. I dont feel like they try and make the employee happy its all about the manager and making themselves look better.",3,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Vincennes, IN",7/17/12,2012,7,17

We taught each other different ways of doing procedures or task to help each other when we found new and improved ways of doing things. We always worked as a team.

Including my concerns about my training and co-workers during that training. The store management is a completely different story, and made doing my job more difficult than it needed to be. The store management (all levels outside of my own department) did not actively promote a healthy, safe and exciting work environment, although that is what they say on paper.I enjoyed the interactions that I had with my immediate co-workers, as well as some of the sales associates I had contact with. The sales associates were valuable in helping to identify people who might need to be observed, or working with me and my department to make the merchandise harder to steal.The hardest part of the job was getting over my own mental block, which I was warned about the first day of training.

Never Again!,"I worked at walmart for a few years around 2004 and left for better pay. It was hard for me because I loved my job and coworkers. I decided when I moved to another state to go back while I was going to school in hopes of using my degree to advance within the company. Upon my rehire I saw things had changed! They no longer hire full time, but they will work you full time at least for 5 weeks and bump you back down to parttime. This is so they dont have to hire you full time and you will see the process will begin again. Your benefits only begin after a year and it sucks. You dont get your discount card for 90 days. The one positive perk is if you attend APUS (online school) you get 15% off of fees and free books. If your a kid who just needs some money for the summer or something give it try.

"Efficiency ""squared""","Wal-Mart's training program leaves little room for error. After beingtrained via CBL's, (Computer Based Learning) The supervisors in charge reinforced said training. I was able to perform the tasks required of me without question as to what was right or wrong. It was a very comfortable setting to work in as a result.Retail, I have found offers no ""typical day"". The days as they come offer different challenges as well as pleasant surprises. Some customers are receptive and cooperative and others can be caustic and annoyed. In the end, its all about making the client comfortable, being selfless and remembering that if you lose one customer, you will lose ten more in as many days. Without trying to Cop Out or stuff all the eggs in one basket, its the hardest and the most enjoyable part of the job. Meaning: If you can turn a client's bad mood into a good one, its a pleasure. If you can make a client's good mood into a fantastic one, the pleasure is doubled. There are a few times, it can be said, where neither are easy. But that's why you're getting paid. That's why its called work.The Co-workers were pleasant company to be around.

Great place to work at.

"Wonderful and caring place to work, with ample room for growth","A typical day at Wal-Mart for me was very interesting to say the least. You just never know what the day may hold for you. It's hard and constant work, with little room to play if you expect to advance. There is always a new opportunity to learn and someone willing to teach you the right way of doing things.Most of the time our HR department was able to hire hardworking/friendly people, so we were pretty much all concidered family even with upper management.If I had to pick the hardest part of my job, it would be getting ready for inventory.

There is no I in TEAM.,"A typical day of work with my current employer involves teamwork, the ability to stay focused on a task, the ability to multitask and have great communication skills. Working for Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, I have learned to take responsibility for my own actions. The management at my current employer has many responsibilities. I will admit it was hard to trust individuals and many policies were never followed through. The hardest part of the job is not having the sufficient support to complete the daily tasks given that are given to an individual. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with amazing people. Every day there are always those special people whether it is a customer or a co-worker that makes your job worth working.

I've made many friends, and the workforce is as diverse as they come.The typical day at Walmart can be truly stressful. The number of customers to serve is staggering, and the amount to work to be done is on par. Top it off with usually poor planning from your management team, and most days can be overwhelming and makes most people quit in under six weeks.However, if you get past that, you'll find friends, really good yearly raises ($.40 - $.60 EVERY year), paid vacations, a flexible work schedule, in-store discounts, and on top of that, company discounts on MANY MANY things from hotel rooms, to college tuition, to cars, and insurance.",4,Current Employee,Overnight Stocking Associate ,PA,7/13/12,2012,7,13

Productive work,"The most thing that I did not like is the balance between family time or always working. I have some very hard working associates that I greatly appreciate the work that they do for me. A typical work day is coming into the office, and checking the back room to see what 3rd shift has left for us to do that morning, and then I would walk the store and see what area need improvement.

"Fast pace, very demanding.",Working overnights as a receiving associate had its perks and down falls. I learned extreme time management. Some management understood the demands of stocking 4+ pallets piled over your head in a timely manner could be a bit of a challenge. Others did not. I loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working while I was pregnant and not being able to do everything I usually did (which was everything the men did at the site and more). The most enjoyable part was getting off of work @ 7am and having my whole day available.,2,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"San Diego, CA",7/12/12,2012,7,12
Not a bad place to work,My workday starts at 5am and ends at 2pm. I enjoy my job because it allows me to learn different things on a daily basis. I enjoy working with my co-workers and the management team. The hardest part of my job is conducting research when I am unable to get the key person to research firsthand. We currently have had that position replaced by someone else and I am looking forward to getting this issue up to date. The most enjoyable part of my job is the service I give customers.

Prison without the bars.,"Favoritism amongst staff and management. Hours go up and down like a roller-coaster so you can't have a life.

fast work pace,"Stocking and cashiering at the electronics section.as well as giving good costummer sevice,and greeting. i have learned some differences on T.v's. some managers can be a little unprofessional at times or treat new employees unfairly compared to the full time employees with any explainations. hardest part of the job was working with unprofessional employees. but enjoyed working for great costumers.",4,Former Employee,Cashier in the Electronics Department ,"Bakersfield, CA",7/12/12,2012,7,12

Great place to work,"Typical day for me as a overnight stocking associate would start off with a team meeting we would discuss our sales that we need to meet or any recognition of employees. Also we would talk about improvements and opinions. Followed by a stream of excersises, including stretching and saftey tactics. Then we would gather shopping carts to use to put our cardboard in from stocking. pull pallets from the recieving room, to all departments. Then we would downstack merchandise onto the floor and area that we were working for that night. Before the end of every shift we were required to clean area and make sure shelves were faced, neat and ""store ready"".I learned how to read Upc's, the correct way to stock items and pull expired merchandise, i learned all of the hard work that entitles getting the store prepared for customers in the morning.Co-workers were the best part of working overnight because we all were real cool friends and we had eachothers back. We all worked as a family and got things done in a timely manner.I would say the hardest part of being a overnight stocker would be around the huge holidays such as thanksgiving and christmas, because we would get so much merchandise half the night we would be unloading everything to almost 2am by that time we only had 5hrs to stock everything and sometimes it was really challenging to get it done having to rush and all.As for what i enjoyed most would probably be the fact that i had to deal with no customers interrupting my work. I would come to work at 10pm when the store was closing, and get off when the store was opening. - more...",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Overnight Stocker ,"Oakland, CA",7/12/12,2012,7,12

Fun environment to help and meet new people,"Go into the employee lounge and find out what all need to be done that day, if you finished your previous work. I""ve learned how to build modules (shelves), I've worked on my customer service experience which is exciting and help sharpens your mind, that was the 1st time I've operated a pallet jack so I've learned how to operate it properly. Management wasn't the best. I don't mind if I have to do multiple tasks at once I actually enjoy it because it keeps me busy, but when the manager above me say that I have to help load and unload the trucks then the manager above them tell me to do something else such as attend the lot at that exact moment then conflict comes into play when I inform them both of what the other has instructed me to do. My co-workers were friendly and productive and I would work with them again anytime. There really weren't any hard parts of the job. The most enjoyable times on the job where when I got to help the customers and make new friends throughout each day.",5,Former Employee,Team member ,"Villa Park, IL",7/12/12,2012,7,12

Great,"I have learned a lot in this store like how to do inventory, mechandising, unloading trucks, leadership holes, an how to multi-Task. The management team will hand out opportunities is they see that you are a hard worker and/or if you qualify for a certain position. The co-workers are great.

love the job,Most of the complaints come from management. We have to wait a year for health care. The starting rate is very low for an employee working in a cooler or freezer.

A good starting job,"If you are educated, and you can tolerate the sudden changes, this isn't a bad first job. The pay is substandard, but how do you expect they keep their prices low? Management are human, which is a good breath of fresh air. You can post internally to move between positions quite easily. Your co-workers will keep you happy, but that is about it.

The easiest part of the job is the same thing.",3,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",7/11/12,2012,7,11

Disliked,"Although they have great benifits,WalMart might be the worst job to have. They are unprofessional, unorganized, and inconsiderate with their employees. While working there I felt like I wasn't going anywhere and that I would never finish school. They would schedule people just for the sake of it. Sometimes there weren't enough casheirs and sometimes they didn't have any.

This did make it very hard to do well in this store. The customers were great, and the fellow employees were like a small family . The job was very action and fast paced. Hardest part was expecting to get things accomplished with a small staff. The store did teach me how a big box was run and what the expectations were.

A not so great place to work if you are looking to get ahead financially and have good job security.,"As an Assistant Store Manager my day would begin with reviewing reports from the previous day for sales, staffing etc. I did learn a lot on the job about inventory control, loss prevention, HR, company policy and overall store operations. Most co-workers were very good folks, I found that a lot of other managers were very stressed and it showed in the way they treated others. There is nothing worse than working for someone that manages by placing fear into subordinates on a daily basis leaving them wondering if they will still have a job at days end. This was by far the most difficult part of working there, along with very poor compensation for the hours and work required. It wasn't all bad, I did meet a lot of very good people and looked at every day as a chance to make a difference no matter what the mood was in the store. If I showed up with a smile, the people that worked for me would be smiling. That made for a great day!",2,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Wisconsin, Michigan",7/11/12,2012,7,11

Employees gets a discount card,I was a cashier at Walmart i enjoyed going to work everyday. To me it was a rush when the lines would be really long and my line will be moving faster than others because i was a fast worker and seeing customers get out of one line to come to mines which would be even longer was a great feeling becasue i know i was doing a good job. As a cashier you have to have people skills becasue you can have the most friendliest customer in line and you also can have some one rude in line as well and sometimes you have to know how to bite your tounge and just keep a smile on your face and kill them with kindness. The managers at Walmart was very nice and always understandable they will work with you as long as you keep them informed. As i have said before you get alot of rude people in your line and for me that was sometimes a difficult task becasue you can be very nice and they can just disrespect you and you want to say something back but you dont want to put your job in jeapordy!

I am one of the rare employees with a decent college degree, which I try not to rub in anybody's nose.I just recently passed my ""leadership assessment"" for promotions after working for Walmart over 4+ years. Management is mediocre at best. I like our store manager though, so I gave management a 2 instead of a 1. I work as a cashier and keep having people promoted to CSS/CSM that are younger than me and less educated. I don't see what criteria they base advancement on, thus that area gets a 1.My co-workers are cool, but major drama. They are cut-throat. The hardest part of my job is swallowing my pride and being bossed around by people up to over 10 years my junior with high school diplomas working on a community college education.

Dependable Workplace,"As a Wal-Mart cashier, I dealt with unhappy customers and dysfunctional machines everyday. The job itself was extremely easy, but also quite boring and tedious.

Like myself, my co-workers found themselves doing the same tedious tasks everyday and dealing with several unhappy people due to the lack of properly functioning equipment and poor management.

Days and Nights working at Walmart,"There is never a ""typical day at Walmart, because every day is differs.

Then there are the days when you are working 4 1/2 hours are you work load consists of of 8 hours, the customers are not in a good mood, you might get hit or called out your name or even cursed out.While working at Walmart I have learned that every one is different, every one attitudes are different and you have to be able to put with people attitudes, if you plan on working with the public. It helps to be a team player also.The management at Walmart are a ""JOKE"" while in training they tell you how to treat the customers as well as your co-workers by acknowledging them by looking them in their faces and speaking to them letting them know you are aware of their presence. Why I say they are a Joke it is because they do not lead by example. They would walk next to you, be in the same room, sitting next to you and they WOULD NOT speak, nod or acknowledge your presence, but they wanted you to do it to them.I have worked with some co-workers that are sweet, kind and enjoyable to work with,these co-workers will lend helping hand if they see you need help(without being asked), then there are some co-workers that are very hard to work with if asked or if they see that you need help will look the other way.The hardest part of this job is that Walmart is not a pleasant place to work because of the people that works their attitudes.

Not to make friends. Management is one of the harder things to deal with because not everyone are on the same page as they should be. The Co workers are some what easy to work with. Its the fact that everyone want to do it their way and not the right way. The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck. At times we may not have enough staff for that day and it may take longer then it should. The most enjoyable part of the job would be lunch.

A great learning experience but the environment was hostile.,"I worked overnight so my day was from 10 at night to 7 in the morning. A meeting with the management and the overnight associates was the first thing of the night. Where the associates were told where they would be working at in the store. Since I was in the backroom and knew my job already I basically waited until after the meeting to find out if management had something special planned for me. This was the best part of the night just to find out what special project I had for that night. The reason behind that was because my main job was to scan items out the bins(using telxons) that were needed on the salesfloor and give it to the asssigned associate. When I was done that I had to scan all the items that the assciates couldnt put out on the salesfloor back in the bins. So when a project came around it was exciting for me getting that done and my regular job done was a challenge and it would keep me working. The hardest part of the job would be at the end of the night trying bin all items back while people bringing pallets back and I had to use the walkie-stacker to put the pallets uptop. It was alot but I use to get it done and the right way too. I learned how to use a telxon, walkie-stacker, forklift, how to stock the salesfloor the proper way, and how to manage associates.",4,Former Employee,Backroom ICS/Sales floor Stocker ,"Hamilton, NJ",7/7/12,2012,7,7

The ultimate dead-end position,"I work as a cart-pusher at Walmart and have been for 4 years now. When I was first hired in the spring of 2008, I heard about the ""opportunities for advancement"" and sought to impress my bosses in the best way I could possible. Within a year, I finally realized that I was going nowhere fast. Despite all their ""promises,"" my managers sought to look the other way when I mentioned other possibilities of being transferred inside. When I persisted, the managers would ""coach"" me, which is a verbal write-up that prevents any way of being able to move to a different store or department for a whole year. This was their way of saying that I was a good worker, by planning to keep me in the parking lot where they thought I belonged with my ""potential."" I got to see associates who were there for barely a month while barely out of high school become my supervisors instead. Other coworkers who sympathized with me said that Walmart is a dead-end job and no place to advance. The only thing that kept me from quitting is because of the lack of jobs in the local areas and my need for a steady paycheck to keep paying the rent for my apartment.A typical day for me is clocking in, and while heading out to the parking lot, get told by some passing supervisor or manager that they want me to get garbage picked up/carts pushed, etc. All day long, I have to beat the heat, keep my head down, push in as many carts as I can(but no more than 10 at a time), and keep enough water in my system to not faint from the heat rising off the pavement.

Needless to say, my days are not boring, its a combination of multi-tasking and prioritizing.

Management is helpful and excellent at communicating priorities. There is an excellent team spirit within the store with both Management and co-workers. The most difficult part of the job is meeting deadlines with limited help at times.

Talk to department supervisor for assignments.It could be:Stocking shelvesHelping other department managersInventory control/analysis of the back roomor where ever else needed in the store.4 o'clock unloading delivery trucks6:30 until end of shift stocking shelves with product receivedLearning about the computer systems and how another company did their inventory was a big bonus.Management was always on site. In the off chance, they wouldn't be around for instruction, trying to get the assigned area done was key. They would offer constructive criticism or praise when they became available.My co-workers were a great team of motivated people, some later on became friends outside of work that I still have.The hardest part of the job was sometimes the customers. No matter what they are always right. It got easier with practice. Seeing some of the same faces in the small town continuously, you get to know how they want to be served/treated and adjust accordingly.The returning customers that I helped a lot made my day the most enjoyable. My favorite was Christmas time. I was assigned to the Toy Department for that time.

"They treat employees like dogs, especially unloaders.","My typical day at work (as an inventory supervisor) went like this: Arrived at work an hour before unloaders to ""prepare"" for the day. Ha, big joke. Was supposed to be printing out paperwork and getting backroom ready to unload the trucks. I either spent that time moving pallets in the backroom so we would have room to unload the trucks, or spent it in the office with management talking about how my unloaders weren't unloading trucks fast enough and if I couldn't motivate them to move quicker, they would replace me with someone who would. Trust me, I tried. I tried bribing with soda and candy, i tried reason, I tried yelling and screaming. Hard to motivate workers, who get treated like dogs, to do anything. Management has unreasonable expectations for the unloaders and they kick them around like dogs.

I learned on my own and spent days at a time pushing carts. The coworkers are like family and that is one of the main great things of working there. I got let go because I was hired as a temporary, but nearly everyone I worked with wanted me back including multiple levels of management. I was one of the best cashiers and they hired a less skilled girl who could only work certain hours due to still being in high school.

Large scale store with multiple areas to work in.,"Wal-Mart is a great job, if you don't have a family to support and you just need to get by. It was not job that I could have sustained and gotten anywhere in, unfortunately.Working in one department did not limit you to that department alone, but instead you were required to learn all departments. From a business stand point, this is very understandable, and I agreed with it and enjoyed being able to go from department to department and not miss a beat. However, being pulled from your home department to another department for an entire shift is a little much, in my eyes, when you are still held responsible for the cleanliness and service in your own department.The original management when I started working at Wal-Mart was excellent. The store manager genuinely cared about the employees and the customers, frequently refusing to raise prices on some things such as bread, milk, and butter. Through the course of my time there, though, we did go through a management change and everything seemed to kind of go downhill from there. Management no longer ""cared"" about the employees, it seemed. We could not longer go in and speak with the store manager as we previously could; the ""Open Door"" policy became closed. It became a place I no longer could justify the lower wages and lack of work/family balance.The hardest part of the job with Wal-Mart was knowing that as a person, you mattered very little to the company. There was not room for growth and your hours could be drastically cut if you raised your head too much.The most enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart was definitely the - more...",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Yakima, WA",7/3/12,2012,7,3
Wal-Mart,"I worked at Wal-Mart for 12+ years. In that time I held many positions. I worked in Lawn and Garden, third shift stocking, grocery, produce, dairy, unloading, all sales floor positions, cashier and supervisor. The fact of the matter is that Wal-Mart expects it's associates to be able to do anything asked, as asked, and as quick as possible. I agree with that ideology. However, there are problems with the company. I enjoyed the customers, co-workers, and some of the managers that I worked for. The hardest part of the job was realizing some members of management could harass and discriminate against other associates and wouldn't face corrective action.",3,Former Employee,Supervisor-sales associate ,"Simpsonville, SC",7/3/12,2012,7,3

Not a good place for advancement based on merit,"An okay place to work at as long as you don't want to advance. You'll work hard. If an opening becomes available, such as department manager, the position will be given to someone they choose based on favoritism, nepitism or personal bias not on merit.

A typical day for me is coming in and having to do returns which means empty out both sides of fitting rooms and put it back out on the sales floor, while being called up to cashier bc of all the customers, or answer the phones and help direct the customers call to right area or sometimes you have to go across the store to look up an item for them if nobody else answers. When you cashier sometimes you get some crabby people who will look for anything to complain about you have to just smile and let them know your trying your best, i deal with all this craziness easier than my coworkers i think bc of me working in nursing for over 6 yrs you are short staffed, overworked, and at times have to deal with unhappy people :)",3,Current Employee,sales associate ,"Lincoln, NE",7/3/12,2012,7,3

Very stressful environment for Managers.,"Walmart has a great policy of promoting from within and I've seen many, including myself getting rewarded for hard work. I've been an assistant manager for almost four years and it's been very hard to keep my faith in the face of ever tightening budgets, reduced hours for hourly associates and home office requiring more and more with less and less. I have no desire to advance any further in the company. The hardest part of the job now is trying to keep the morale of my associates up but it's getting tougher when their paychecks become smaller as their workload continues to increase. They still have bills to pay and families to support and have to manage with cut hours and less money coming in.The stores are micromanaged now which puts more pressure on the store managers instead of lessening their stress. This translates into added stress on shift and assistant managers.The thing that I enjoy most about my job is the relationships you build with your associates and getting to know their families. Also the friends you make as you move around in the company. You can always call someone from a past store and get their help with any problem you come up against.",4,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Southwest USA,6/29/12,2012,6,29

Walmart has changed for the worst in employment satisfaction,"A normal day at Walmart involves much direction from many members of management. For that reason nothing is done correctly, and the job that I signed up for is not done at all. However, management feels the need to always look at the short-comings rather than encourage and work with the associates. The most difficult part of the job is the inconsistency, please allow the time necessary and give the correct direction by one person rather than everyone saying different things with no communication. The most enjoyable part is when management goes to meetings and allows us to do what we do, we always excel in those situations.",2,Current Employee,Fashion/Home Zone Merchandise Supervisor ,"Bartlett, TN",6/28/12,2012,6,28

After the holiday season a simple chance in assistant managers brought everything to a 180. Our hard work was met with baseless criticism and impossible demands. The management refused to see reason or logic and were content with barking orders regardless of our situation. To make matters worse, managers would often fight with one another, using us as the weapons and putting us in situations where we would be working on a project under one manager's orders only to get barked at by another for not doing what they wanted.

Management was not excellent but if you needed something done they would try to help you the best they could with the time they had.

I think the head of walmart should be on the boss show. Then they would see how the real employees feel. The real employees are the ones who are doing the work and the management takes all the credit.

Retail,"A typical day at Walmart would be planning out my associates day in order to complete the tasks I have been assigned. Some days are much more work while other days can be less. What I have learned from this job are effective time management skills. On any typical day we move between 1,000 to 3,000 items a day while giving exceptional customer service. I also learned how to manage other individuals. This is probably one of the most invaluable skills I have learned because I have to effectively manage individuals different attitudes to complete the days tasks.

Once the cashiers were on a register I would count down the cashier's drawers who were about to leave for the day. Once the switch was complete, I made a list of the days activities and assigned each cashier with a duty for the night as well as their lunch times.

Good laid back environment,A lot of people working there would be very stressed about the job but it was fairly easy. The only time it really could get stressing would be any time an unhappy customer would come in. On the other hand when friendly customers came in it was easy to be in a better mood the rest of the work day. I was able to make new friends working there and the management was very easy to talk to.

Amazing Co-workers and room to grow.,"I helped maintain the counts on all the overstock the store had. I would pull items as need to replenish the shelves. I helped with stocking and preparing all the merchandise for the new MODs (Displays). I helped maintain the cleanliness of the back room as well as the store when I was on the sales floor. I would also help any customer I can into contact with while I was restocking or on the floor at anytime. The management there is typical management. they do rotate the departments they manage about every 6 months or so so it is a little trying to go from the standards and rules one one to another. My co workers were willing to help and understood the tasks we needed to achieve and were willing to team up to make sure that they all got done. The most enjoyable part of my job was working in the back room I loved the ""behind the scenes"" aspect of it.

A tolerable workplace that is mostly just a place to make some money and can be enjoyable at times,"We typically each day work numerous pallets of merchandise that are left in our department by the overnight stocking crews which can range anywhere from 5-20 pallets of merchandise. We work through and put on the shelves what merchandise we can fit and the rest we put back onto pallets, wrap them up and using a walkie stacker we place them up into steel holding racks until they are needed to be brought down again. I've learned how to use the telexon scanner device thoroughly. I have learned about inventory tracking and I have been certified to use the walkie stacker and the forklift which we use in the stores outside drive-through where mulch, bricks and other heavy outdoor home improvement items are kept on pallets. The management at times can be very excellent and the managers and supervisors can be very polite and understanding and fun. Some days though they can be extremely rude and ignorant for no substantial reason whatsoever. Most of my co-workers are enjoyable. Some tend to slack a lot and wont do their share of work to anywhere near the best of their abilities. The hardest part of the job is trying to accomplish many of the tasks given to us for the day by our department manager and supervisor which at times can be extremely overwhelming. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help out customers and knowing that I am putting in my best effort each day that I walk into the store",3,Current Employee,Lawn & Garden Sales Associate ,"Middletown, DE",6/25/12,2012,6,25

company that gone downhill,I have worked for this company for 15 years and benefits are cut on a yearly basis. Upper management is clueless on whats goes on. Employees are being cut left and right and work loads are doubled to make up for the lack of help. Half the people work their tails off and the other half walks around and chats. The company no longer cares about the individual. Their opinion is that if your working for them your life centers around them and that there is so many people out of work that they would not have a problem firing someone who will not follow their warped sence of management. There is more corruption that goes on in this company than you can ever imagine,1,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,Missouri,6/25/12,2012,6,25
"Stressful, fast-paced workplace.","I worked in the Garden Center as a Sales Associate, though I was on the register the majority of the time. I loved the customers that came into the Garden Center versus the people out in the main store. I had fun tending to the plants and interacting with the Gardeners. It was very fast-paced, and you had to know your stuff about those plants! The managers seemed to have taken advantage of us since we weren't part of the main store, and didn't give us enough water during the summer time. They always thought that we didn't work our best because we had to handle plants, but I can assure you that we did! It's a tough job if you can't handle the heat of the summer and cold of the winter, but it is a job nonetheless, which I was appreciative of.",3,Former Employee,Garden Center Sales Associate/ Cashier ,"Columbus, GA",6/25/12,2012,6,25

Also, it allowed me to enhance my overall communication and leadership skills.The work environment is very flexible and encourages collaboration among different teams and divisions. However, projects or programs execution will vary subject to the team in which you operate. For example, Insights might focus more on long term strategy and Operations is usually more short term execution driven.The hardest part of the job is to influence and keep engage large teams (100 + associates) in order to ensure the success of a large scale program.The most enjoyable part of the job is to execute high impact initiatives that have a direct impact in the lives of our customers.

I enjoyed working there.,My co-workers were very dependable. I enjoyed the atomsphere. I learned that you must work as a team to get things done effectively. There was always something to do at work I never really had a time to sit down which was a major plus. The hardest part about the job was when you were givin an outstanding task and it had to be completed by the end of the night. It may have been a job consisted to finish in ten hours but you only have an eight hour shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working on assignments with my coworkers we were able to enjoy eachothers company as well as complete every task.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Modular Team Member ,"Chicago, IL",6/25/12,2012,6,25
Another job to pay the bills,"98% of the days as a cashier were very busy. Interactions with the customers was actually my favorite part of the job, whether they were upset or not. It was a bit of an adjustment going through so many different members of management in such a short period of working for the company. It was also stressful for management to announce new rules that were being enforced, without sharing the announcements at least on a bulletin board or in an area where all employees could view then to be chewed out for following old procedure when we were left unaware. There never seemed to be enough people on the registers during a really busy time of day and there would be lines that lasted over 30 minutes on quick check. For the most part though it was always an adventure, never knowing what was going to be in store the next day at work, and with that element of surprise it was easy to go into work not knowing what to expect. The reason I chose to work for such a large corporation was because I understand the way that Sam Walton ran his business. No matter how large a corporation, the workplace should always be treated like your home and you should welcome your guests warmly, without the guests there is no business, and I've seen too many people take advantage of the lowest prices and price matching as an excuse to treat customers poorly, because 'Oh well, they'll come back'. I sure hope so, and I hope they are treated excellent the next time they come in.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Shelton, WA",6/25/12,2012,6,25

I figure out which are the most high priority tasks and start from there. I visit each one of my department heads and give them there tasks for the day. I will check back with them several times a day to check on their progress. I feel that I do learn something new every day. I absolutely love my co-workers and get along with them famously. The hardest part of the job is when there are call-ins in multiple departments. This leaves us short handed and sometimes morale will get a little on the low side. When this happens we adapt and overcome. The most enjoyable part of my job is the respect I have earned from the 38 employees that are my responsibility.,3,Current Employee,ZONE MANAGER ,"Lima, OH",6/24/12,2012,6,24

Mr. Sam's philosophy was ""take care of your people and they will take care of you""! This is certainly not the case anymore. this company overworks the people who are employed there. they do not hire enough people to do the work that they expect to be done, but still expect everything to be done and be perfect. they look for reasons to push the long term people out the door and if they cant find them they nit pick until the person gives up and quits",1,Former Employee,Prefer not to state job title ,"Savannah, GA",6/23/12,2012,6,23

The enjoyable part of the job is making sure the customers are taken care of and are satisfied with their orders. Sometimes the most difficult part of the job is making sure that everything is done in a timely manner. However when the area is shorthanded that can be a difficult task. Management overall are willing to listen to our concerns as employees and find a solution. Because of a continuous workload that keeps them unavailable to employees, howver, it can be a challenge to communicate properly with them.

It was a learning experience,"Walmart is a great place if you are not involved in multiple activities. A typical day at Walmart is super busy, I was always cooking and serving customers. There was not always enough workers to cover the load so I would have to take late lunches, or skip breaks. I learned that in order to keep your sanity you must find a balance between work and a social life, or you will eventually completely lose one or the other. The management could have been better, there were too many things that were over looked that caused issues. My co-workers were usually upbeat, although there were a few that refused to be fair with our work load. The hardest part of the job was that there were task I was asked to do that no one wanted to teach me how to do.

"Wonderful people, awful corporate policies","Most of the people who work at Walmart for any length of time are really nice, hard-working people. Some management is as well. Others are pretentious, self-righteous control freaks. The work load at my Walmart seems excessive and even unrealistic. It creates an environment where work either cannot be done correctly or cannot be done within the given timeframe. It also seems that the driving force for this way of doing things is executive bonuses, which drives resentment from those people busting their hump trying to get all the work done on time.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Roxboro, NC",6/20/12,2012,6,20

Over all work environment.,"RESPECT: the company makes it a value to value their employees, but some management does not practice this value, while others do...so it all comes down to who your manager is and their individual values as a person.BENEFITS: you gotta be there for 90 days until you are eligible to receive your discount card, that's a longer wait than some companies, but it's nice that they do offer one to their employees.JOB SECURITY: they do background checks on employees they hire, which is more than most companies today. if you are a hard worker, are open to working many areas in the store, and have a flexible schedule too work, it's a pretty secure job, more than mostWORK?BALANCE: they seem to value you as person, making it understood that when you are off the clock you do NOT work unless you are on the clock. that's nice and appreciated.CAREER POTENTIAL: it's there if you work hard and do all the hunting around to get the position you want.LOCATION: the company is located all over the area in most states, you do have the ability to transfer to a store that is close to your home if it's a hardship, i respect them for that.WORK ENVIRONMENT: it depends on the store, the management or the most part the stores.

Uncaring place to be,"Working overnight or during the day, management is rude, uncaring, incompetent and untrustworthy. Policies change almost monthly and you are not informed. Benefits are bad, but you will be fired if sick too often. Some employees have passed, but we are not notified and cards are not sent to family. Some Store Managers are verbally or physically abusive to Co-Managers. HR investigations or allegations of harassment or discrimination is not taken seriously and leads to nothing. Managers may only deal with lost children in store if they have time or are not busy. They do not pay maternity leave.

worst place I have ever worked,Since Sam Walton died I have seen and heard from the old timers at WalMart how much the company does not care about thier employees. I seen it my self as well. Pay sucks the benifits suck they take from the employees to keep costs down so they can keep thier prices cheap. When we are in the slow time of the year they look for ways to fire people again to keep costs down and thier bonuses high. I was fired during the slow time of year and seen it happen every year I was there which was 4.5 years.

The managers don't manage, the workers from previous shifts don't work, but management wants the job complete all the same. How does a multi-billion dollar company save money? By underpaying the peolple who actually put in the man power and hours to save you that money in the first place, all so that my managers can see a bonus that is bigger then my years salary.

Not as bad as they make it out... but not great either.,"Wal-mart was interesting. It can get a bad wrap and sometimes it's deserved. When I was applying I felt like a person and that each manager interviewing me knew who I was by name and so on. After I was hired it was very clear I was just a number and most of the friendly/family values they preach during interview aren't seen. The only way to get time off is with a first come first serve system that allows you to sit down and go days and weeks down the line if putting you at the top of the list each time. Family issues don't seem to matter to them and if they lose 1 employee of their 50-100 staffed the store will apparently fail.Was not all bad though, the actual people you work with can be quite nice and since they are all going through the same stuff as you bonds can be formed and almost a sense of camaraderie because of it.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"La Crosse, WI",6/20/12,2012,6,20

At first, I liked it (in the bakery, but then around day three or so I was fed to the wolves.Walmart starts off with orientation and CBLs (computer-based learning), which was easy peasy of course, but the personnel teams at Walmart do an extremely terrible job with orientation. They give you a checklist of all the things they need to go over, only less than a handful of which they actually do, and they then proceed to tell you to check everything off and sign it saying that they went over it. I'm a person who goes by the book, and this just violates all sense of employment dignity in my mind; if there's a checklist and it is part of orientation, just go over it!Walmart also has other sales associates help ""train"" new associates, which is fine to an extent, but it is also the ZMS and department manager's job to make sure the new associate is being trained and being trained properly. That hasn't happened at either Walmart I've been employed at. In the bakery, I never learned most of what I needed to know even after a year of being there. By my third day of being on the floor in the bakery, I was forced to run and close it by myself, weeks prior to being trained on cake decorating since all bakery associates need to know how to at least write on cakes.That being said, about two or three months into the bakery job, I was called into the assistant managers' office for a verbal warning about ""not doing my job.""

"Good for starters, but don't stay longer than a year","Walmarts' a good starting/temporary position, they are always hiring, but there is a reason behind it. They don't treat their employees right. The management generally sucks. I've only had 2 good managers, and they weren't even in the same department I was in, so I hardly ha the pleasure to work with them. They will fire you for little to no reason, if you aren't doing exactly what they want you to do(and sometimes the things they say/ask just don't plain make sense). There is a good camaraderie between coworkers, though. A lot of us got off at the same time, and we would all make plans to go eat somewhere, or do a group barbeque or gettogether. Other than that, though, not much room for advancement.

After the holidays I moved to the jewelry department. There were inventories to be done and shipmements to check in and arrange on the salesfloor. I learned how to open all types of watches and replace batteries as well as removing links to resize them when needed. One day the manager of the Pharmacy Department ask if I would consider coming to work in the pharmacy. It was a step up and I accepted the offer. The pharmacy was like it's own little entity.Sometimes the Walmart rules didn't always apply to us. There were no ""mandatory""fifteen minute breaks.I was working three ten hour shifts not knowing when my break would arrive.

The hardest thing I had to do there was lifting of the larger 60"" plus inch televisions above head to wall mount them.

Fast paced retail chain,"The typical day at work was very busy, most of my time spent running a register. When I wasn't at my register, I was usually performing 2 or 3 jobs at once. I learned to work with anyone, and how to handle unruly customers with a smile. Managment was very hands on, almost a little too hands on. Some days it felt more like micro-management. My co-workers were great, and usually made working more fun. I would have to say, the people I worked with were the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was the astronomically high expecations corporate forced management to hold us to, there were definitely not enough employees to accomplish each night what they wanted us to.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Cashier ,"Salem, OR",6/15/12,2012,6,15

Walmart was a fun place to work.,Typical day started on the night shift at 10pm. I learned just how hard Wal-mart works to maintain its store and easy access for customers. I realized just how spoiled I was when I walk into retail establishments. Management was great and beyond fair. Co-workers were mainly young people which helped get through the nights. Hardest part of my job was the lifting other than that there really wasn't a hard part of the job. Most enjoyable part was getting through all the freight for the night and having my supervisor and first shift come in with out the hassle and headache of over working themselves and just being able to do their job comfortably.,4,Former Employee,Stock and inventory ,"Salem, IN",6/15/12,2012,6,15

friendly coworkers but little advancement opportunity,"A day at work consists of repetition and constant customer interaction.I learned several different payment methods and sales methods, organization skills, and i extended my social skills.Management, I feel, does not acknowledge employees and give them opportunities they deserve.Majority of co-workers work very hard and have to deal with a lot of customer interaction. Majority are friendly and deserve advancement.The hardest part of the job would be the constant standing and repetitive motions. It's very strenuous. The most enjoyable part of the job would be who you get to work with. I feel a comfortable environment sets the pace and ambiance for the rest of the day.

Walmart has not taught me anything any other employer from my past has. The Walmart management have been very satisfactory. I enjoy my co-workers very much i think they are a great group of people.

Walmart has changed alot over the years and not necessarily for the better.,"What I've learned at Walmart is that there is no room for advancement for fulltime employees, that managements going to cut your hours, sometimes in half in pay periods in which we have bonuses or holiday pay. A typical day for any employee there consist of working short handed which is the hardest part of any day when its busy. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you have a regular customer seek you out just to say hi.",3,Current Employee,Front End Cashier ,Mississippi,6/15/12,2012,6,15
Apparel,"A typical day depends on what time you start. If you work in the morning you would do whatever the supervisors say, at night expect to finish whatever the supervisors didn't and clean the departments by folding clothes, picking up and doing returns. The bad about it is that if you are cross-trained in anything else you will most likely cover those areas' lunches/breaks or to cashier since there are most likely cutbacks in all stores. On top of that you are most likely to be expected to get your area(s) done to perfection (unless your supervisory staff is forgiving for these things.) The best part of this job for the most part is my co-workers.

Not very friendly or student friendly.,The first thought that came to mind when applying for Walmart was that it was a major company so I figured I'd get well paid and plenty of hours. Unfortunately this was not the case. I was paid minimum wage as a cashier part time with limited hours but still required to go above and beyond my duties which I always do anyway. Not only that but I also wanted to go to school but they couldn't seem to make room in my schedule for that either. The managers at this Walmart did not treat employees with respect. I always felt under pressure and unhappy every working day. Which to me is the biggest priority because if employees aren't happy then customers aren't going to be that happy either.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Jacksonville, NC",6/15/12,2012,6,15

Some of the management were helpful, but mostly they were not. Wal-Mart touts themselves to be a family oriented business, but they are not. I didn't mind the physical aspect of my job, I minded how we were treated as a majority. Mentally, this job created more stress then all of my other jobs combined.

I worked at this job for almost six years and tried several times to move to a different department but was never allowed. I was told twice that I would be moving to a different department, by two different managers and it never happened. I had to approach them to find out why nothing was happening after a month went by with no results. The hardest part about working at this job was that I would work hard while others did not, and while I got in trouble for being out sick, those that showed up and did no work went un-punished.

They were always on top of things, when a customer had a question, or needed them they were their first priority.Co-workers were easy to work with, they were there to help you learn and to answer questions when a lead couldn't.There wasn't a hard part in the job, it was not easy but it wasn't difficult either.The most enjoyable part had to be the management, they made it a joy to work there.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Williamsburg, Va",6/13/12,2012,6,13

A place where I learned a great deal of experience working with automobiles,The work was very enjoyable.

Horrible,"If there were things that hadnt been done during my shift, i had to stay and finish which was not a problem. But then the next day i would have to either take a longer lunch or go home early to make up for the hours i stayed.

Great job for a young person who is looking for their for first job.,"This was a great start out job.There was always constant movement which was wonderful.

There is also a very high employee turn over rate.",3,Former Employee,Inventory Control ,"Turlock, CA",6/13/12,2012,6,13
A Good Start,"A typical day at work simply put involves checking out customers as quickly and effeciently as possible while trying to maintain a level head and excellent customer service. I've learned that despite a possible ""hard to deal with"" customer, I've managed to stay polite and friendly no matter what. My co-workers and managers are easy to get along with. The managers keep things in-line while still being someone you can go to if there's a problem. The job of cashier isn't difficult to do as long as one pays attention to details and the needs of the customer. The most enjoyable part for me is when I can show an interest in the customer and their day and turn what may have been a frown into a smile.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Rockwall, TX",6/13/12,2012,6,13
good decent job,Good work environment but had its 'clicks'. Management could have been a little more understanding and compassionate and workable for workers and people. Also a little more pay and raises would be a plus.,3,Former Employee,cashier ,"Warwick, RI",6/13/12,2012,6,13
I had fun working there pleasant people and positive environment for the most part.,"A typical day at work entailed zoning garden center, watering plants and checking out customers. In some cases Management leaved something to be desired, but it was rare. My co-workers were a lot of fun. We always got the job done and had a good time doing so. Hardest part of the job was stacking coolers without a forklift license, because I didn't have one a I had to use a giant ladder, very tall and very scary at times. The most enjoyable part was finding an item (whatever it was) for a customer, it always made them smile. Unless it was damaged. If it was the aforementioned smile soon faded.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Plano, TX",6/13/12,2012,6,13
Productive and a fun place to work,"A typical day at work required me to clean trash out in the parking lot and finish bringing the carts in from last nights work, then the supervisor would have me do other things inside if it was slow out outside like going to the back of the store and getting the grocery bags that just came off of a truck to the front of the store, then after that was done I would go back outside and get some more carts that other customers brought out take them to the bay. Sometimes I would have carry-outs that were called in on a radio that they give us during the day. The hardest part of the job was the weather was unpredictable so like if it was storming out that would slow us down a little and slow would to if it got to high up. Then the most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to work outside and also interact with other people cause I love to help people that's just who I am.",3,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"De Soto, MO",6/13/12,2012,6,13

Large company with many opportunities,"I managed multiple departments which required daily stocking, inventory, checking out of stock items, resets, and time management.

Work Habits,I think Wal-Mart is a great place to work. The people that you work with can be an issue at times. I learned a lot while working even troubleshooting steps for equipment when they would break down and not work effectively. The management had certain people that was favored but I was okay with the idea because as a member of management I favored the co-workers that would do what was asked of them without too many issues or problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was just relationships that developed with customers. The hardest part of the job would be changing schedules and hours during the down time of the year.,4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Greenville, NC",6/13/12,2012,6,13

I love working with money and people and I I get the best of both worlds at Walmart. MY favorite Part of working at Walmart is heling people, and the worst part is dealing with negative customers.

I enjoy going to work and being able to interact with people that you know or become good friends with, both employees and customers. I mean you do come across not so happy customers, but its all good as long as I know that I wasn't the cause for their irate attitude. I work at a Walmart branch that has recently opened and the amount of customers visiting the store is real little, and it is because we lack inventory. A lot of customers had complained about the shelves and racks not being stoked in time or they have little merchandise on the sales floor. As well as management we could use a little change, not all managers are friendly. If you could line up the managers I have you could easily pick out that ones that favors certain employees. The hardest part of my job as a cashier is waiting for customers to come to your register. I can be standing up waiting to assist a customers for more than 7 minutes and that is because our store is empty.

I've never seen part driven and non-driven managers. But overall, the best thing I've learned was how to build a relationship with a customer and to how make sure that they have what's needed at that present moment. And to always encourage them to come back and have a much more better experience then before. Another thing I learned is, teamwork.

Our management team was always willing to assist you with whatever you may need help with.

A Typical Day,"I worked in a large department in Walmart. Most days I felt as though I was working the department alone.

I wouldn't recommend working here.,"A typical day at work is watching all the managers (when they're around, which is seldom) standing or walking around, but not really doing anything productive, especially when it got busy and there were long lines. What I learned is that they are deceptive in their practices. The management told me I had to use a ladder to get merchandise from the top shelves in my department as part of my job, and the safety department told us not to use the ladders. However, if we chose to obey the safety department's rules, then we would get fired for not doing our job.Most of the co-workers were great, but one gal got away with anything she wanted, and when I reported her, I got wrote up for it. The hardest part of the job was ditching the managers, so they wouldn't try to fabricate something to get you fired.

It was break time so I had sombody sit with the tank& took my break. I was wrote up coming back from my break. Eventually after being harrassed for over a year I was wrongfully terminated. My supervisor chased at me with a forklift Cussing & yelling with the forks scraping the ground. My neighbor who is a sheriff told me a list of felonies that he committed and Wal Mart said I was insubordinate & fired me. The supervisor still has his job. I would too but it was my managers day off the only manager who was fair with my prior reports of the supervisor telling .me where ""A womans place"" is and other reports of the same supervisor yelling using Profane language on the sales floor and showing me disrespect by belittleing me with wonamizing behavior in front of customers. And they say I was insubordinate. hah. he was head of risk control for several years before all this. my guess is if you worked risk control you get job security due to knowlege of company wrong doings they dont want anybody to tell.",1,Former Employee,Garden Center Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Lakeland, FL",6/11/12,2012,6,11

It earns you the respect of colleagues and management, and gives you the stability in your job that is needed.Management is a constant presence throughout the store and keeps up with you throughout the day, making sure you have the coverage and help needed to accomplish your tasks.My coworkers bring laughter to my day.

Definitely a good experience,"Even though Wal Mart pays only a little over minimum wage you still will have a great time working there. On top of working with your coworkers who are willing to help you learn your job you also get to help customers which always leaves a good feeling behind even if it is your job to do so. It didn't matter if I was stocking the same things all the time or making sure things were neat the day flew by as long as I worked and didn't watch the clock. There were no clocks anywhere nearby most of the time anyway so that was a good thing. It was good work, not too hard but you couldn't slack off either. The only thing is the workload will determine your work hours and if you are a temp employee you might not stay after the holidays or busy season because at that point business is so slow they can't afford you or there won't be any work for you. One great thing about the job was that you weren't constantly supervised and told what to do, something different from my previous jobs where everything had to be done by the book. At Wal Mart I actually had the chance to do things whatever way I wanted and figure things out for myself. My coworkers also helped push me to get a little faster each day so I wasn't always the super slowpoke that I used to be at my old jobs.",4,Former Employee,Frozen and Dairy Stocker ,"Auburn, WA",6/9/12,2012,6,9

"Great culture with history and values- Pay not so great, and there is a high rate of Terminations","A typical day at work at Wal-Mart as a Courtesy Clerk starts off by entering the premises, scanning the parking lot and taking note of the current customer per shopping cart ratio. Upon entering the building it is mandatory you clock in and out accurately, just as your shift starts and begins. You may find yourself waiting by the machine to clock in as everybody is trying to do so at once.

A full day is expected every time you walk through the door. But if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. My 10 years with them taught me more than I could ever have thought possible.

Profit and Sales are important at the expense of customer service and regard for associates,"The upper management is constantly forcing managers to cut hours last minute.

Apply if your desparate,"I was a Unloader sounds easy enough but its not. Very physical job and if your not fit you wont last long. You start your day laying out pallets, unloading the trucks and separating the frieght by department on to each pallet. Their trucks merchandise aren't on pallets so you'll have to pick up each box by hand. Truck size varies form 1600 normal to 2200 pieces boxes are from 20 to 80 pounds maybe more. Afterwards pull pallets with jack to sales floor by department, clean backroom, and if you have nothing else to do you stock. Co workers are friendly and if ya need help you can count on them. Management however likes to play favorites in terms of moving up in position, they don't care about your safety much and if you have a problem you cant rely them to help you fix it. Walmart cares more about numbers than its employees and if you don't like how the company is run your as good as gone. I left Walmart because my team and I were being harrassed by a manager because we reported her to home office for the way she treated people. She fired 3 of my teammate 1 deserved it for stealing. Tried to get me twice but I gave up from being hounded by her.",1,Former Employee,Unloader ,"Aurora, CO",6/7/12,2012,6,7
Fun times and always ready to go into work,I have learned how to treat costumers and how to maintain a smile at all times and take care of any job that needs to be done. Most of the jobs are small but I would still get the projects done as soon as I could. Walmart is a great place to work and you get to become friends with a lot of your co-workers. The co-workers are fun and are always willing to help out when another co-worker needs it. The hardest part of the job is when your on the project a manager has gaven you and you have to do something else for another manager. The best part of work is your co-workers they make everything fun and some of the costumers get you to smile and laugh sometimes.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Moline, IL",6/7/12,2012,6,7

Pleasent work experience,I was a Loss Prevention officer every day was a new learning experience for me. I learned how to diffuse hostile situation without the use of force. The management team and coworkers were very supportive in times of need and when ever you needed a ear to talk to. The hardest part of the job was not knowing if the person I was stopping had a weapon on some sort.,5,Former Employee,Loss Prevention Officer ,"Barstow, CA",6/7/12,2012,6,7
Not my ideal workplace,"A typical day would be a anywhere from a 4-9 hour shift. I would spend the entire shift cashiering with an hour lunch and two 15 min breaks unless I worked a 4 or 5 hour shift in which I would get one break.I did not learn much, except maybe how to deal with difficult people.The management was hit or miss. I had many managers. Only a few were understanding people. Since I had school full time, I had a specific schedule which they were willing to work with. However, as a cashier, my schedule was ever changing. The longer I was employed, the more that I was scheduled. My schedule began running into school obligations, and after many discussions with my manager, he unpleasantly changed my schedule back to what I originally requested. I occasionally had to call in to make my classes, and I got in trouble for that which I felt was unjust. This is why I ended up quitting.My coworkers were pleasant people who I enjoyed working with. They faced many scheduling issues as well with management.The hardest part about my job besides dealing with my schedule was that some of the customers were very mean people. This was my first job, however, and I wasn't fully prepared.The best part about my job was my paycheck. It wasn't much but it was the only thing keeping me there.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Plano, IL",6/7/12,2012,6,7
It was a job and a paycheck.,"A typical day at work was usually going in and picking up other peoples slack. The work place was very unorganized and counter productive for 3 1/2 years which was my entire stay there. Although it was a terrible place to work I did learn a lot. I think that may be one of the best things about the job. I gained a lot of experience and knowledge. Most of Management was very unorganized and were very disrespectful to their employees. That was tolerable however that on top of unsanitary work conditions, clutter, short staff, associates not working etc was no good. I can't really think of anything good about the Walmart I was at. I can't say all Walmart's are bad but mine was dreadful. I had great co-workers and I had a lot that weren't so great. The ones that were good for doing their share I thank but the rest didn't make life any easier especially when management came down on your for them not doing their job. The most difficult part o the Job was moving up. The harder you worked the more they wanted to keep you down and where you were at. They didn't want to lose anyone who was good at what they did so they held you in the same position even if that meant getting coached. The most enjoyable part was getting my paycheck because working there was a awful experience and the money I earned was the only thing I could look forward too. I wish there was more good I could think of than bad but it was that ""Bad"". A lot of people got burned out and couldn't continue and ended up quitting or getting replaced because they just weren't able to muster up the energy anymore.

We also had to record each phone that was sold to see our net profits the company would be receiving for the phones.

My review of walmart,The org. Has very good ideas but never completes what they start. Does not show real concern for its employess nor its customers. A typical day at walmart would mostly consist of auditing other managers jobs and follow up with associates work completion. I have learned that when you set out to do a task my sure you complete it. The management team was often stress because of the lack of training. My co-workers and I worked as a great team always as one.

Understaffed,"My typical day started at 2pm and I would walk into the afternoon traffic at work. Carts would be low, cashiers breaks would not be done, and our cash drawer would not be balanced.

Horrible,They barely train you they just throw you to the wolves. It was literally bad it was more like a popularity contest. Nobody wanted to help anyone. They taught us things that just didn't seem right. Like we're not allowed to help a customer off the clock. Some associates take that literally. Once I saw a manager totally ignore a customer who asked him where the mayo was. It was horrible.

Productive work place,"A typical day work means, coming in at 8 and checking phone inventory. Answering phone calls and assisting customers with cell phone needs.

Great place to work,"Wal mart is a good place to work, but i think its call about where your store is located,and also who runs your Dep. ( YOUR MANAGEMENT). if thats all in order and your grass roots are good, then in my eyes you should never look to quite or go anywhere. I'm the type of person that loves to work, i love helping others, and hey!!! i love my own money. In the area at the wal-mart i worked, Sales where slow and just after 3 years for working there- a team of 20 plus workers got laid off.

I wouldnt work there again.,"I worked for a distribution center, and at the one I was at they didnt seem to care much for the associates concerns or conditions. They only care about the numbers and how to get them higher no matter how it affects the bottom hourly worker. Before I separated from wal mart the quarterly bonus incentive was gone. Also management shows a great deal of nepotism to some. And 80% of the time you couldn't get anyone to relieve you of your work for breaks and even lunches.

"Not a bad job, very poor management team makes working there very difficult","Management in my store was very poor, often times schedules were made outside of an employees availability. Salaried managers often not knowledgeable of the departments they are in charge of. Especially when it comes to departments in the fresh area such as meat, deli, produce or bakery. None of the members of the management team were capable or willing to work in the deli in the event that we were short handed due to absenteeism or a poorly written schedule which results in poor customer service. Managers never compliment the work of their subordinate employees and many are condescending.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate- Deli department ,"Round Lake Beach, IL",5/30/12,2012,5,30

"Unable to motivate workers, minimal benefits, low pay; overall an unpleasant place to work.","I began my position as an Electronic Sales Associate first at a different store. I was trained by one of my co-workers, who did a very good job of training me for the position; it wasn't his job to train me, it was that of my supervisor, who was rarely around and was very rude whenever mistakes were made when she is the one who was supposed to make sure that my training was complete and that I was able to complete all tasks properly. The co-workers were great, aside from gossip issues, but that can happen anywhere. My department manager was an absolute joy to work with; she was the only one able to motivate me to work given my minimal benefits and mediocre pay. Your experience at each store will vary depending on your management team, coworkers and customers.Given that, corporate is the same for every store. The benefits are terrible for the nation's largest grossing corporation. Customer service positions are among some of the most underpaid, most stressful occupations in the United States.My overall experience was unsatisfactory, but I would do it again in a heartbeat to work with the wonderful people I got to work with on a daily basis.",2,Former Employee,Electronic Sales Associate ,"Auburn, IN",5/30/12,2012,5,30

I'm still unemployed, now for 1 1/2 years.

I am Very disappointed...,"I use to think that Wal-mart was an amazing place, where workers were treated with respect. Unfortunately, i was deceived at how they do not work with their workers. For example, management do not help their workers make sure that all the tasks are done. By that I mean during Christmas rush, management (except for a certain few managers) will not get out on the floor and make sure everything is done on time and as required. There is also an extreme lack of communication between management and their workers, and even among management. In my honest opinion the only thing I find they are good at is when an employee request a day off or such, they don't give you hassle about it.",2,Current Employee,Dot Com Associate/ICS ,"Greenville, TX",5/28/12,2012,5,28
Needs better management.,"My days of work are usually calm and quiet, until my supervisor comes and makes everyone's day bad, including fellow managers.

Walmart does not screen well enough the people they put into a position of leadership.,I think that the immediate Supervisor of each individual department and all coworkers have a meeting at least once a month.

"Good people, poor management, poor policies","While WalMart can be a wonderful place to work, the execution of its policies can sometimes be deemed as unfair. Seldom are second chances given when a mistake is made and rewards are few and far between. Overtime is strictly discouraged even when it is in the performance of your normal duties.

Nothing positive to say.,"I wish I would've listened to my son and never went to work for Walmart! He said they don't treat their employees very good. I have learned that in the years I worked for them. Don't trust your co-workers and especially management! They don't care anything about you, your life,family,other commitments. They say customers are number one, but management won't even show up when a customer asks for one. I use to love my job there, but day after day, it just got worse. I slowly started hating my job. They fire the hardest,honest,best workers they have, and keep the worst,lazy,dishonest ones. Why, because they are cheap! They get rid of you if you are making good wages, so they can hire for minimum wage. There should be something done for the bullying and harassing that we put up with, to try keeping our jobs! I would not recommend Walmart to anyone!",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Clio, MI",5/26/12,2012,5,26

Very low morale,"Terrible management. Associates and lower to mid level management getting yelled at and cussed out in front of customers for minor mishaps. Hardly any employees enjoy their job and only show up for a pay check and go home sick and tired. This company that started out as a once pleasant place to work has become one of the worst employment opportunities. The home office came to the store to say they are going to change the way management runs the store to boost morale but has never come back to see that upper management didn't follow the guidelines set up. They give you the idea that there are opportunities to move up in the company or move to departments or areas of the store you would like to work in, but they never follow up on that so employees are stuck in the environment they would like to move out of also causing low morale. management puts employees in positions where they become hurt and have to go on light duty causing them to have to work less hours. They also listen to people that are only trying to get what they want to make others look bad and thus pushing other employees into a position that they cannot be respected by other managers of others departments.",1,Current Employee,Garden Center Sales Associate ,"Sonora, CA",5/26/12,2012,5,26

Not the best job I've had,"Within the first week of working there they tried to pull one over on the new employees. They hired us as part-time and gave us full time hours. The reason for this was because full time workers get benefits after 6 months and part-time workers get them after a year. So they try to work you a lot and you reap no rewards. The pay wasn't that good either, basic corporate wages and bi-weekly pay checks.Night crew is probably the best position for that company but I've never worked it first hand, I just know they get paid the most for entry-level positions.",2,Former Employee,Provide Outstanding Customer Service ,"Deptford, NJ",5/26/12,2012,5,26
High in demand workplace,"I can't explain a typical day at Walmart, but there is a routine for Assistant Managers to follow. I have learned how to manage people and be tactful. How to balance a good schedule with efficient associates to gain performance in a particular area. Some times the demand of things that need to be done in a short amount of time can feel realistic, and this is where it feels impossible, but with delegation and time management it all gets done. I would rather do 80% of my tasks with 100% accuracy, then to do 100% of my tasks with an 80% accuracy. The people make the job more than enjoyable.

Their reputation is well-earned.,"A typical day involves me securing and selling high-priced cell phones while performing the duties of an Electronics Sales Associate and covering between two and five other departments as well. It is a fast-paced job that requires me to balance customer service with the execution of the duties required to maintain my department and push sales.My managers are very hands-off by nature, preferring to leave the day-to-day operations alone unless something specific is required. Understanding their goals makes anticipating and satisfying their requests comparatively easy.My co-workers span a variety of different personalities and backgrounds, but we all tend to get along rather well. I've made it a point to be on good terms with even the persnickety ones, as I don't see the point of co-workers making each other miserable; we get more done when we don't waste energy being mad at each other.The hardest and most enjoyable part of this job is actually the same thing: Learning that you can't count on other people to do their job, and being willing and able to do what needs to be done regardless.

Company not the same anymore,If you are a young single person willing to dedicate your life to the company then you may like it. I was there for over 25 years. I loved my job and felt like I was treated fairly until after Sam passed and after that it went downhill. By the year 2005 when the company changed the structure the company was a miserable place to work. They expected you to treat the employees like they were dirt and like they came a dime a dozen. You had to live your life for them. If not you were history. The open door policy may as well be taken out of their vocabulary because they do as they wish. I am so glad I am no longer there.,2,Former Employee,Store Manager ,Raleigh NC,5/24/12,2012,5,24

The hardest part of the day is two hours before shifts over because I'd have to make sure everything goes where it's needed to. The fun part is the first three hours because it's the easiest. They say to follow walmart procedures, but not even managers follow them, it's an unsafe work area.

I learned how to effectively manage people, time, and myself in order to keep the store running smoothly. Management at Wal-Mart often is made up of people who started in hourly positions with the company and worked their way up the ladder due to hard work.

Most of the Co-workers I worked with were very nice and willing to work as a team.

Working at Walmart was a learning experience,A typical night working at Walmart from the hours of 10 pm - 7 am would be different. Reason why I say different is because of the strange customers that would come in that time of night/morning. I learned what Walmart employees have to go thru with customers having attitudes. Management was the worst on third shift other employees working that same shift tried to voice the problems that the management was having but nothing was ever done about it.

What I leaned from working at Walmart is the electronics department; I knew the basics of computers, laptops, and TVs before working at Walmart, but while working there I've gained knowledge on a lot of technology. There are different managers for different departments; Electronic's manager is very supportive and helpful. Whenever you are having trouble on an assignment she usually goes through each step of the assignment, making sure you understand the material. My co-workers are the ones that keeps me going everyday, I believe having a good environment makes a good workplace.

Overall good place to work,"I worked for Wal-Mart on Parkway for over 2 years. Its an overall good place to work. You work hard, you get moved up. You're full time, you get benefits (not the best but they are benefits nonetheless) and paid time off. They are sticklers for attendance (which is pretty much any job) so make sure that you're on time aren't calling in a lot and you'll do well",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Overnight Stocker ,"Tallahassee, FL",5/23/12,2012,5,23
An easy job if you can get it,"I worked as a cashier, life was easy. Get a customer, ring up their merchandise, take their money, smile and say thanks.Difficulties arise with customers. WIC users and foodstamp users tend to not know how to purchase qualified items.

Management / job is a waste of time,"The management is so blind and unguided. They have absolutely no idea what they are doing. The department managers are completely clueless and unless you hang out with them you will not get far in this store (Port Isabel). I recommend everyone stay away from applying here unless you're in a major need of whatever job you can get your hands on. The pay sucks as well by the way starting 7.36 compared to other jobs that start you off over 8.00 they want to make you a slave for them. Since when are cashiers supposed to clean windows, dust carpets, wash and clean vending machines, mop entrances, and use harmful materials without proper care. Sounds like a maintenance job to me.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Port Isabel, TX",5/23/12,2012,5,23
Depends on location and which Wal-Mart store,"A typical day at work varies, you may have a good day or your day may be horribly from management to ungrateful customers who tell you all day that they own shares with WalMart. I have learned that customer service is not for everyone because some people don't value your feelings or how words affect you and WalMart doesn't seem to be founded upon being a Family-First establijment first any more. Management is terrible at times, just depends on who your manager is. Management can be selfish and unconsiderate of employees needs. Employees are always depressed and it seems like a never ending aroma when you enter. The hardest part is recieving unappreciative results from management and customer alike. The most enjoyable part of the job is basically the employees because you have someone to lean on who understands what your goin through. Management either doesn't give position advancement or if they do you will not be compensated.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tyler, Texas",5/23/12,2012,5,23
Productive and Steady Workplace,I would go into work usually about eight oclock. I would manually moved pallets around with a pallet jack. I would downstack the pallet onto my cart. I would pull my cart to the area I was working in. Then I would organize the products on the shelves to stock the products that just came in. I would work with the vendors somedays helping to find good areas to display the products throughout the store. I would help management and other associates in displaying the products. I would build features on stackbases. I would help customers find what they were looking for. If it wasnt on the salesfloor I would look for it in the backroom. I would help keep counts on the products in the backroom by printing labels and writing counts on the labels as I put them in the bins before I scan them with a telzon.The hardest part of the job was pulling heavy pallets and stackbases of merchandise throughout the store. What I enjoyed most about my job is that i was able to learn alot and use my ideas sometimes.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Orange, TX",5/23/12,2012,5,23
WalMart Review,"Wal-Mart just was not the place for me. I have never worked in retail before and working for the largest retailer in the world was on a much great scale than I thought. Without that background, it was very difficult for me to adapt to the work days. Management communication wasn't always up to par as well. With a lack of communication is makes the work environment hard. Working 14 hours a day on your feet was the hardest part of the job, after the daily demands. The most enjoyable part of the job was the schedule (Assistant Managers worked 3 days on & 3 days off) and the pay.",1,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Houston, TX",5/22/12,2012,5,22

You can realistically waste your first two to three weeks doing them. You will make good friends but remember that their open door conversations always leak out so be prepared for the repercussions of what you say. Your management team will try to make you work far more then you should doing tasks that you will never get trained to do.

Easy place to work,Wal-Mart actually sticks by their values......It's a job that's pretty much all about customer service. The only thing that was unfair to me is that I worked for them for 4 years and was getting closing shift when they would bring in new people and have them on the day shift.

Plus, some of the things that I have enjoyably experienced while working for this company as a sales associate, is that I have learned a lot about electronics and new technology and I enjoy the fun atmosphere that is present when I work beside certain co-workers who are also hard-working and team players like myself. However the hardest part of my job there, is that there is a high-turnover and new employees seem to be coming and going through a revolving door so to speak... and I don't know if it's because they feel uncomfortable because of the minimum training that is initially offered through a computer system, or if they realize that they are just not cut out for retail as a whole. But either way, it makes the job harder and more frustrating when there is a great deal of work to be done and the few hard-working employees in any given department are left to pick up the slack where the slackers left off!",2,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Aurora, OH",5/17/12,2012,5,17

An Ok plave to work,A typically day would be to go in have a meeting get my direction from my shift managers then have a meeting with my associates to assign them their tasks for the day. Then I detail tour my area and then assign tasks for the issues I have found within my area. I go back and follow up to ensure everything has been completed and then have an evening wrap up meeting with the store mgr and shift mgr to go over what we completed that day. Most of the managers are awesome but then you have some that well it's just all about what they can do to promote even if it means making someone else look worthless. I have learned over the years that the harder you work and the more knowldgable you are the less you are appreciated and there is almost no hope in promoting. I have great co-workers who will stand behind you no matter what. They are always there for help and support. I think the hardest part of my job is going to work every day with that mind set that you are gonna do something with this job and then working so hard to prove that when you just get shot down and kicked in the face when you try to move up. I think the most enjoyable part of my job would be how many new things I get to learn about the company and also my customer experience.

The biggest struggle that you have is teling yourself that what you do means something even though you are doing basically the same task everyday with little to no encouragement from anyone. But you make steady money and you can do things to insure that you make more money. The best thing to remeber is to learn the rules and the ways to actually get things done and just your job well and show up on time and clock out for your breaks on time. You will make friends and you will really get close to those who you work with if you try to be a friend and a good solid worker.,5,Former Employee,"Cashier, Sales Associate, & Truck Unloader ","Greenville, SC",5/17/12,2012,5,17

"Nice, easy going job with good pay and friendly co-workers","A typical day at work: I would arrive to work at 10am or 12pm (depending) and go straight to doing my job. I would cut meat and cheese. The deli clerk prepares chicken and takes orders. I was also required to wait on customers. I prepared trays while practicing food safety. We would work about 4 hours, get an hour break, then work the remaining 4 hours. I would get out about 7 or 9pm.What you learned: I learned how to cut meats on a slicer quickly and efficiently, and how one should handle the hot bar.Management: I give management 2 stars because management wasn't around that much, and when they did show up, it would be a pretty quick in and out sort of deal. Maybe they get pretty busy elsewhere but they weren't very attentive.The hardest part of the job: I would say the hardest part is when it gets around closing time and if you happen to have that shift, you have to work twice as hard and twice as fast to make sure everything is cleaned up and looking tidy because there isn't overtime if you happen to go over your shift.The most enjoyable part of the job: That is easy, I most enjoy slicing meats and cheeses for the customer and the interaction that comes along with it.",4,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"North Bergen, NJ",5/17/12,2012,5,17
Great working atmosphere,Walmart taught me a lot about management and offers a lot of opportunities for people looking to move up within the company. Most enjoyable part is getting to work with a lot of great people.,4,Current Employee,Zone Manager ,"Jackson, TN",5/17/12,2012,5,17

"Job is fine, Management is terrible","I enjoy my job, everyday. I really enjoy person-on-person customer service. I love teaching, I'm evening getting a degree in it. I love my co-workers, they are fantastic. We cover for each other on days we need extra coverage, often take late lunches/breaks when the schedule doesn't allot for the people working, and work VERY well on projects and customer service. The pay was not fantastic for the expected work-load, and the hours were terrible...but the thing that made it worse were the managers.For a month, daily, I told both my immediate manager and the next go-to about a HUGE schedule mistake made by ""The computer"" that scheduled me outside of the hours in which I was available. The management just...ignored me.There was also another time where my immediate manager ""claimed"" to have received a dozen customer service complaints about me, though could not give me any information about the complaints, not even what about or when they were given. He quickly tried to place me into a position with less pay and less hours in a department I was knowledgeable about. I noticed they had released my position and the person who was in the position that the manager was trying to force me into was going to be moving into mine. I spoke to a co-manager about it, and I heard nothing back...though I am still in my position.To me, it seems like sometime between being an hourly associate and being salary, they've forgotten about the little guy. Of course, my occurrences might be only local.",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Saint Augustine, FL",5/17/12,2012,5,17
never again!!!!!,"Dont ever work for this place! if you do youre selling youre soul to the devil. Benefits are next to nothing sick leave is nil and management is absurd (except for a couple). You would think the largest retailer in the entire world would be able to pay a little better and offer some type of decent benefits, and to make it wors they dont hardly hire anyone full time so they can fall in that loop hole of not having to offer them to as many people I have worked there going on two years and i have only accumilated ten hours of personal leave thats it! Im so glad i only took this job to get through school. I would almost rather be homless and broke than to work for these idiots.....wait, I pretty much am.",1,Current Employee,sales associate ,georgia,5/17/12,2012,5,17
Mixed Bag,Wal-Mart is fine if you need a paycheck. My current management team is pitted against each other by the store manager and this creates conflict from the top down. I've many years there so its not all that bad. As long as you show up to work and don't steal its hard to get fired.I have had the chance to see man different areas of the store and can handle whatever work is needed.

Productive work place with areas needing help.,Overall Walmart is a dependable place to work but some mangers need to read up on the policies they are supposed to be following. Seems like alot of harrassment issues and just basically need to treat the associates with more respect so that they don't have the good ones quit and make the bad ones act worse on everyone else. For the money I get there it's not worth being harrassed and treated badly when I get more than I'm supposed to done. I'm not complaining but they just need to work more as a team than as enemies.,3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Murray, KY",5/16/12,2012,5,16

Always Smile,"Each day at Wal-Mart was different. I met a variety of people, some I got a chance to know because they were regulars. I learned to get along with customers as well as my co-workers. It presented a family-like atmosphere. Co-workers bonded when someone within the company or neighborhood needed assistance. The hardest part of this job was trying to please difficult customers, which turned out to be the most enjoyable part. Management provided incentives and kept morale at its possible highest.

It was a good place to work. I enjoyed doing my job.,"I would go in at 6:00 AM, sort buggies as to where the defectives would go. Scan the defectives and place in a box, throw it away, or it would be shipped back to the vendor. Would have to make phone calls to get return authorization to send merchandise back or throw it away. We would have to handle hazardous waste material and put it in the right barrels to be picked up once a month. Would have to get packages ready for UPS to pick up. Would have to audit the boxes with the store manager to make sure it was done right.I learned how to use the telxon to scan merchandise. How to handle haz-waste material. To ship merchandise by UPS, and how to take inventory once a year.I had one supervisor over me and the store manager. I had 2 women under me.

A productive but stressful work place,A typical day at work was filled with helping customers and taking care of any questions or concerns that one might have had.

Occasional confrontations were necessary in order to get routine work done when management felt they needed to pull associates or self from work areas to other areas of the store, especially considering short staffing.Co-workers made it easy to pass time during assignments and customer service work. Ability to work with others was a must as customer flow could spike.Hardest part of the job would have been being pulled from my assigned duties to take care of issues in another part of the store due to short staffing. Would often times stay after shift in order to complete all tasks.Most enjoyable aspect of the job was meeting and dealing with people, both new and established.

Gofur,"I did cashiering sometimes and dealt with guests' request but for the most part I pushed carts outside because the ones who were supposed to do it never showed up so they couldn't even fire them. So most of the days I was just out and about in the parking lot pushing carts uphill or I was helping customers get things into their carts. I also got called in often to take the place of just anyone that called in but they still needed that person, back room, dressing room, shipping, automotive, management. I was able to do it all but had the most fun when I was still able to talk with customers.I did cashiering sometimes so I learned to use a cash register and how to talk to people properly.If I was cashiering my manager wasn't around much because I didn't mess up alot it was mostly to get me on a break and that's about it or remind me to go home and not keep working just because I like it.If I was outside pushing carts she'd call me to find out where I was and if I was working when I wasn't supposed to because I loved working here she'd send me home.Working with other people was fun when we were outside, I'd take charge and we could easily clear the parking lot of carrts in an hour or two then I let us take a break and just talk or if we were super busy inside I'd have us go cashier for a while because that's what we needed to do officially because the cart pushers never came to work but stayed on payroll for 6 months before hiring more.Hardest part of the job was the long hours, I was in highschool at the time so I was doing school full time, then working full time and - more...",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Niles, IL",5/15/12,2012,5,15

Me and my co-workers work together trying to find solutions to work more efficient but once we get a plan going management steps in to mess it up, its like they are against us.

Wal Mart is a good company to work for just remeber your a # with a face.,"As an ex employee & former assistant manager for WalMart, I found that the company is not for the employee what so ever, but for the all mighty dollar. They're customer service has really gone down hill due to all the cut backs including eliminating possitions, not hiring full time associates but rather part time instead to save on the pay out of insurance. To keep the bottom line as low as possible. Remember the store manager has to get his or her bonus at the end of the fiscal year. I loved my job, I gave it my all & not any time did I hear a good job or an at a girl. I made a mistake & I was terminated. What a shame for all that knowledge & training for them to throw it all away. The mistake I made was not anything to do with theft, bad language, disrespectful, falsifing records, or favortism, but what i did wrong was not to lock the door when the associates went outside during a snow storm for their 15 minute break @ 12:00 midnight. I left to change the security tapes & came back to lock the doors after they all came back in. I was terminated on my next shift. The store in Greenville, PA was the best store I ever had the opportunity to work at with the best team of managers. The store in Kittaning, PA was the worst store I ever had to work at in my life.

An Unproductive Madhouse,"On a typical day you can count on getting in trouble for some rule that they changed yesterday while you were off. If that's not enough the managers do not take your side even when following proper procedure.One manager will tell you to do one thing and another will tell you not to worry about that because they want you to do this. Then again you get in trouble because, no matter what you do, you can't split yourself in half.Managers do not deal with problems until they are out of hand and you have a customer screaming in your face for something a manager told you to do. But when they finally do arrive, they do not want to deal with the verbal abuse that they were about to put you through so the customer gets their way. There are exceptions but they rotate every 4 days so you may not see a good manager for a week.The hardest part of the job is keeping it. I spent years walking on eggshells in that place. No absense is excused, whether you end up in the E.R. that night or you have to go home early because your vomiting on a register. With their don't care policy it is easy to get six absenses in six months. Oh and everytime you miss a day, it stays on your recond for that full six months.The most and maybe only enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with and the quarter bonuses. I didn't just work with the people at Walmart, they become your friends and second family over the years.

Good place to work for long hours but in the end great customer service provided to the customers,The days were started off with looking at sales ensuring the store was ready to open. typically you would have a morning meeting to inform your associates and recognize associates for accomplishments. Managers did minmal training of their subordinates but they would do daily walks of areas in your depatments for instruction and to ensure compliance of the home office/district layouts. Most workers were hard working and dedicated to succeed my first Wal-Mart job had associates that had averaged 10 years or more with the company. The hardest part of the job was the long hours as a manager some weeks you worked 6-7 days. The most enjoyable part was changing the store during the seasionality events and having fashion shows to show the new fashion for the seasons and the envolvement and excitement that was displayed by the asociates.,4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Anniston, AL: Glen Burnie, Waldorf, Laurel, MD",5/11/12,2012,5,11

I would like being there more if they would all be on the same page. My co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of my job is the fact that I know that they dont want to help me advance and then explaining to the customers all of the different changes that come up and why we did it last time but wont do it this time on the price matching.

Sometimes there is not enough staffing, and so planning breaks and lunches can be challenging. Everything that Wal-Mart has to offer can be beneficial to others.

I liked the managers, except, they definitely had their favorites.Walmart policy states that any manager or supervisor isn't supposed to fraternize with people below them in their departments, however, only a couple of managers honored that policy. Anything personal discussed with a manager was quickly spread around Walmart. I liked all of my co-workers they are all wonderful people with a common goal, to make a living. Everyone is very caring and hard workers. The hardest part of the job was I couldn't make all of the customers happy. If we didn't carry what they were in search for, or the return policy's, I try my hardest to make everyone happy, and for them to enjoy their experience.

Agree and do as your manager wants you to and you will do fine,"15+ years and 13 were great but as advanced and oversaw more people and took on challenges that no one else would my job security fell with it. My career had highlights of District Manager of year in region for special division, was CoManager of Store of the Year (1 out 3000+ stores) and took over one of the top three worst stores in CA. Once I volunteered and agreed to take over a challenging store and I challenged my superiors on changes and programs outside of company ones to make the store successful i was receiving extreme push back and denied changes needed but when went around current barrier by my supervisor and went higher up was able to implement these and show they would work. Ever since then my supervisor was against me for not following her initial directions. Solution from supervisor was need to run like every other location and since it hasn't been successfully since opened, and as took over and made drastic changes and saw improvements instead of joining with me focused more on cookie cuter operation which doesn't always work. When have store along ocean in San Disgo, CA and a store along the coast near Port of Long Beach they can not carry same merchandise and customers shopping habits are different. One is a beach resort area and one is blue collar working class and beaches are not visited like those in San Diego.

Providing customer service 24 hours a day.,"Working at Wal-Mart has taught me a whole lot about people. There are so many different personalities out there and being where I was (Customer Sevice), you will come across them all. Satisfying every customer one-by-one can be a very difficult task. But I think the most challenging part of working at Wal-Mart is dealing with your co-workers. Some are nice to work with. And some tend to carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. And overtime, you will learn how to handle all sorts of emotions, problems thrown at you, and overall how to get along with just about anyone.

"Although there were issues with the management, it was still an enjoyable job.","Typical day required searching for potential thieves by watching the surveillance cameras or on foot in the store (undercover). We also locked up merchandise on the floor and high priced merchandise that came in daily. We also were in charge of safety issues in the store (inspecting fire doors, fire extinguishers and clear aisles). My co workers were always very helpful and we assisted each other during investigations. The most enjoyable part was working as a team and helping out my co workers with apprehensions. My management was horrible. I felt uncomfortable to speak to them about issues. They had horrible communication skills. That was the hardest part at there.",2,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Newburgh, NY",5/9/12,2012,5,9
The high cost of low prices,"Over the course of the last five years I have witnessed the price that the low prices on our merchadise comes with. Schedule changes are often required at the last minute. I have gone from 1st shift to 3rd shift back to 1st seemingly every other week since taking over as a Department Manager. Employees are expected to sacrifice their time at a moments notice, by being asked to work extended hours minutes before leaving for the day, only to be required to shave the time by taking extended lunches the remainder of the week. The sick leave program operating on a demerit based system is a joke and is often only enforced when convenient. I've witnessed persons being reprimanded for taking maternity leave, as well as those missing time for taking care of a sick child or themselves. You're required to give at least three weeks notice for use of personal and vacation time, but often times are forced to wait until the very week before to find out whether or not it has been approved. The favoritism at play in some stores is enough to make you sick though I'm sure that this is a quality rampant everywhere. The absolut worst thing about working for Wal-mart is the micro-management. People are often pulled in so many different directions that very little can be accomplished. When stating tasks that have already been assigned they are waved off dismissively, but are then held against you when you are unable to finish all work assigned.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Tilton, NH",5/9/12,2012,5,9

Destroys your moral,"Walmart is a very coporate ran company. Store management has little say as to what goes on in your store. Management doesn't care about how much work you have, but they always expect you to get it done. They have a quota, if your quota is 10 hours they still expect you to finish it during your 8 hour shift. Most of their ""programs"" make any sense, and when they fail they are too stubborn to remove them. So, you get stuck with a bunch of bad ""programs"" that negatively effect they way you work or how your store runs. They have quarterly bonuses but the people who set the projections set them super high so it's almost impossible to get any bonus, and if you do it is too small to be significant.Walmart is good as a very last resort because they are constantly hiring with their very high turnover rate, however, if you still have options left out there I would try those first, second, and third.",1,Current Employee,Overnight Assembler ,"Irving, TX",5/7/12,2012,5,7

Working there was ok,"A typical day working with the company ran smoothly, you get your assigned area and you pretty much go from there with putting away returns and zoning.

The management team....there were a few managers that make you think why are they managers but them as a whole were great! I had the most amazing them working in my department, we all got along great and since we had such a great bond and can work as a team we always got our jobs done.

I found some of the managers to be a challenging to work with, but I'm grateful for the challenging experince. My co-workers where always a pleasure to work with and we were great as a team.

Promotion,"I applied for a position, that was a promotion. About 2 months after I was offered & accepted this position, they changed it & added more areas for me to oversee. I NOW have 4 times the amount of work then the original position required. I tried to do this extra work, but shortly realized it was too much for me. I went to the store manager & asked if I could step down, explaining this position was more then I could handle. She said ok. Of course as I should of expected....they dragged me along...""We'll get back to you"" ""I'm working on it"". Excuse after excuse as to why they weren't moving me as quickly as I hoped. Three months later, they fire me for not doing my job, after I asked them if I could step down. I explained to her I made her aware that this job was too much for me & she said I could step down..now they're firing me !!?? She said she will not change her decision. It took many, many phone calls to the market manager, who by the way...said the same thing ""I'll get back to you"" over & over. After many calls & letters, they took me back at a position I can handle. So to sum this up....management lies. Its easier for them to ignore you & your concerns then deal with it.

The bottom line is the only thing that matters. Walmart does not value their employees or customers.,"There is an absolute lack of communication among managers and the favoritism is rampant. If it is true that attitude is reflective of leadership, then the overwhelming attitude of most walmart employees that they are enduring a prison sentence is definitely due to the deplorable leadership. I myself have been told on more than one occasion to not do the job correctly, but just to do it fast and make it look good. I have been told to tell customers whatever they want to hear to get them out the door quickly, and it was made clear to me that I wasn't being told what I was hearing.

Never a Dull Moment,The job isn't horrible. It isn't the most highly recommended company to work for. Management changes the way they want things handled on a daily basis without warning. Management is quick to jump down your throat if you don't make expected work times for you assigned work areas. There is constantly a double standard.

Wonderful Experience,"My typical days at work were very busy and sometimes didnt feel like there was enough time in a day to get the things done. As an Inventory associate 4 pm was my deadline were my work had to be done. I learned that urgency is something that you must have at a job. Also I learned that the customers are the most important asset to any job. If it wasnt for them we would not have the jobs that we need. Also keep them happy, make their experience a great one, and always take care of them. My co-workers were awesome. Always made the day bright and fun. Always willing to help and teach things that you want to know how to do. Hardest part about the job was dealing with the stress. There is so much that they need done but never seems like you can get it all done or if its the way they want it. Management are very helpful but also have their flaws. They are always there to listen if your having a problem at work, at home, or just having a bad day. They are always willing to teach you things. Their flaws are communication, and making the work time very stressful. The most enjoyable part of the was the people. The customers and the co-workers.

Busy Place to Work,"When I walked into Wal-Mart as a new employee the store was empty. I came to work at Wal-mart to help open the new store on Carolina Beach Road as a produce clerk. I helped build it by putting the fitting rooms together, chair gaurds on the wall, freezer and cooler shelves in, department shelving in, back stock shelving up,and much more.The crew finally got the store ready for stock. It was alot of work, but by Grand Opening Day Wal-Mart was emaculant. Every orange and apple turned just to the right postion. The wet-rack was spectacular with every fruit and vegetable chosen from our ordered stock for freshness and quality. The display of color in the produce department was spectacular. We had worked 10 hour days for 2 months and we were proud. Then the doors opened. needless to say everyone in Wilmington was ready to shop at thier newest Wal-Mart and the real fun began. We had the best produce team! We started quickly moving stock saftely through the crowd to keep up with demands of the dwindling produce. We were ready with answers for customer's questions. We also made vegetable and fruit trays and cored pinapples for the ice racks. My dedication to our department never disapated. One morning I had just finished setting up the very long wet-rack when regional managers came for a surprise visit. They were so impressed with our department and with the detail of the wet-rack they gave us accomadations and praise. I had to leave Wal-Mart to take care of a family member with Alzhiemer's, but I do miss it and often go through the department I help build seeing if anything has changed - more...",4,Former Employee,Produce/Dairy/Meat Clerk ,Wilmington NC,5/4/12,2012,5,4

The associates are VERY stressed, management pushes & pushes them until they can't take it anymore and end up crying. Hours are cut with the exspectations of getting all the work done. Full timers are getting 30 hours one week, 40 the next. It makes it very difficult to budget.

Great Environment,Refer to resume as far as Typical DayI learned a lot at Wal-mart. I was able to build an awesome relationship with my patients and my co-workers. The managers are hard workers and wonderful to work with and to learn from.The hardest part of the job was handling the fast-paced work requirements with extremely low staff but thankfully I feel we succeeded each time. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people daily and being with my co-workers. Also I really enjoy it when my co-workers and when my patients gave me compliments.,5,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Round Rock, TX",5/3/12,2012,5,3
Challenging,"A typical work day at Wal-Mart is basically go to work do my job and be assigned to do about to other people's jobs then go home. I have learn to be really patient and stay focused on completing my duties. The management were helpful in the ways that they were able to help. They worked with me and my home life, to help balance the both of them. My co-workers were fun and delightful to work with, we always had a helping hand for one another. The most enjoyable part of my job honestly were the people I worked with, and the most hardest was being up so late throughout the night.",5,Former Employee,"Cashier, Modular ","Dallas, TX",5/3/12,2012,5,3

terrible at 880,"worked with everyone every-ware and i have to say 880 was the most horrible experiance i have Ever had at a job, managers are actualy 2 faced bosses who do nothing but the minimum some are racialy bias to the degree that you wont get hired, others cut corners and rush things without thinking, the clientell is impatient unrully and theft/fight/robbery prone. maintenance involved cleaning mostly Blood,Feces,bodly fluids and organic food off the floor unless a criminal commit a injury fraud for there own monatary gain, i would have had a better time if i actualy got switched to another spot in the store but no one actualy is willing to help you here at 880 wal-martevery other walmart is awsome but this one",2,Former Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Irving, TX",5/3/12,2012,5,3

Sam Walton Would Not Be Happy With His Company Today,All the training at Walmart suggest that the customer is very important and that the employees matter. This I have found is not the truth in my situation at Walmart. They do not wish for you to spend any time getting to know the customers wants and needs.Management likes to direct orders and point finger but does not wish to help employees make a difference. Too many employees getting hurt on the job from not getting help they need.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Kansas City, MO",5/3/12,2012,5,3
You're a badge number,A typical day is chaotic. Management doesn't know what is going on and customers yell at you because you have no direction either. Hours are cut to ensure management bonuses; associate bonuses are non-existent. Get ready to be nothing more than a badge number.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Arkansas,5/3/12,2012,5,3
Cashier,My job was ringing up customers. Hours were great at first but after first of year I was spending more in gas than hours I was working a week.

I love Walmart. They care for their customers and employees.,"Each day, when I sign in, I anticipate a positive experience. Right away, I am engaging in friendly, accurate service to customers I enjoy. The day's activities include processing orders, careful bagging, solving problems, giving information, and handling money.At Walmart, I have improved my expectations of myself. I have to be on-the-ball, ready to do a good job, and to do it correctly.Our management is very caring, hard-working, and responsive to my needs as an employee.I enjoy being with my co-workers and have problems with no one. I have a privilege of having a great place to work. We greet each other positively and enjoy conversation on breaks.The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers which happens rarely. Every now and then, a customer comes in who is difficult to please. I see it as a challenge to remain positive and to serve them well. They usually leave with a thank you to me.Working at Walmart is a very enjoyable experience as the majority of the customers I serve are very nice people and make my job pleasant.",5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Rockford, IL",5/3/12,2012,5,3

Cashier supervisor,"At first this job was ""THE"" job. or should i say career. I loved working at Walmart. Then hours were cut they limited the number of cashiers we could have at any given time.

Therefore i resigned looking for other opportunity.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Fallon, NV",5/2/12,2012,5,2
"Excellent work, and people experience.",Working here allowed me to interact with individuals from many different backgrounds.

The hardest part of working here was probably managing my school and work schedules.,4,Current Employee,Wireless Sales Associate ,"Lake Wylie, SC",5/2/12,2012,5,2
Mediocre Work Environment,"A typical day at Wal-Mart can range from fast-paced and teeth-clenching, to enjoyable and thumb-twiddling. They have pretty strict rules about uniform, personal appearance, timeliness, customer interaction and standards of job performance (each being somewhat different for every department). You eventually learn how to fake a smile and keep your mouth closed even when dealing with the most unruly customers or supervisors. Most of management can be friendly - if you catch them at the right time, but there are many cases of associates being unjustly punished (up to being fired) for first offenses that were minor, while other ""members of the team"" can repeatedly break policies and rules without any sort of coaching or discipline. I will say that the many co-workers I have worked with were very pleasant people. You can become a family of close-knit friends and the support system is something to be cherished. There is truly no difficult part of the job other than standing still for long hours, which can wear on your body. Certainly the most enjoyable part was being able to meet and talk with many different people.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Carthage, TN",5/2/12,2012,5,2
Walmart,"My day consist of customer service, cash handling, credit checks, manual overides of digital images, knowledge of digital cameras/camcorders/cell phones.The hardest part of my job I would have to say is that there are issues that are out of my control and therefore I cannot accomodate the customer. My job is to please, assist and make my customer leave the store happy and wanting to come back and look foward to their next visit.

Laid back place to work,"I work in the Deli section of Wal-Mart. I find that my co-workers are easy to get along with and will help me with any questions that I have. I work in the evening so most of my job is finishing cooking for the day and cleaning up. I have learned how to judge what food items need to be cooked for the evening and how much based on how busy the deli is. One of the hardest parts of the job is balancing the cooking and cleaning between greeting the customers, answering their questions, and taking their orders. Once the customers and most of the cleaning have been taken care of, it's nice to be able to talk with my co-workers and get to know who they are.",4,Current Employee,Deli Sales Associate ,"Junction City, KS",5/2/12,2012,5,2

We worked Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. til 5 p.m. or later if needed. This job consisted of moving taking down old fixtures and setting up new ones for the inventory to be displayed upon.

Clicks/Adults with horrible personality,"Walmart wasn't hard at all, not enough pay, other co-workers goes around bragging about bonuses that the entire store put in but only the ones that been there longer gets all the bonuses. And they have really bad clicks been around alot of adults that still act like children. Management was head of the clicks and of course would break all the rules and had such poor attitudes. And management socialized with certain people and those certain people was the same people. I did enjoy moving the lines out meeting people. The co-workers were moody one day they want to talk to you and the next day they don't like you. Walmart had to many personalities for me to keep up with. It was never the same.

Getting worse....,"I have been working as a cashier since 2003. I have seen CSM's come and go. When I started, they were hard workers, made sure we got our breaks and meals. Came to our register to solve any & all problems. Now, not so much. They stand at the podium ALL day and talk. They are so concerned about who likes them & who doesn't they fail to take care of us. They gossip, tell cashiers who was short, who got written up & worse yet.....who was coached !!!They are lazy and call out over & over without being held accountable. What great role models. And they have the Front End ZS taking care of the back room as well !! Who came up with that brilliant decision. Have 1 person take care of 2 total opposite sides of the building. Management doesn't back up the CSM's, they will let them flounder. This is a poorly managed store even with the new store manager. All of our store managers were more interested in rumors, gossip & making friends. This could be a great store, if management functioned properly. It used to be. Management won't help if the lines are long...they used to.Management won't help with the poor scheduling..they used to.Management is so afraid of someone calling the home office, that they will make unethical decisions & put you & your job at risk. The market manager is a bully & feels threats is the solution to his poorly run stores. So....to make a even longer story short...avoid WalMart, they will put you down, insult you, disrespect you, lie to you, spread rumors, gossip and cut your hours out of spite.

Store 2992 in Painted Post,"From my employ during 3/1/2004-8/4/2006, I went from a slightly positive attitude about WalMart to a conviction it is the worst thing that ever happened to the U.S. I have witnessed in my employ such things as disposal of paint cans in garbage dumpsters, severe infighting in store between employees, abuse of safety regulations, verbal abuse from superiors, negligence on part of store managers. I was accused of failure to be team player because contractor left ceiling tile open in food cooler, and no other employee attempted to put it back in place as I did my job as maintenance associate. My walkie did not receive the call, I could not hear the PA call, and was held accountable for it. We were required to push only ten carts at a time, and had no assistance from inside associates until massive call-offs during holidays began occurring. There is no hygiene requirement, as one employee has been caught scratching her groin and rear, and still works as a cashier. There is no requirement for quality product, as entire pallets of food have been written off.I am convinced they would rather sell nothing than sell half what they have, so they can write off what they did not sell instead of paying revenue on what they sold.",1,Former Employee,"stock, bottles and returns, maintenance ",Painted Post,5/2/12,2012,5,2

I regularly work as a cashier which a typical day includes cashing out customers and providing good customer service. The most enjoyable part of my work day is when we are appropriately staffed and efficiently running are lines so we don't receive complaints from our customers about the wait to be cashed out . Most of my Co-workers are friendly and helpful if needed and management is usually the same.,3,Current Employee,cashier ,"Raynham, MA",5/1/12,2012,5,1

Working for Wal Mart,"Working for Wal Mart wasnt a bad place to work, it was great as for as hours, and benefits.

Although we did a lot of task by ourselves as well. However we was there to make sure everyone was ok to make sure that business was ran smoothly.

Every Man for Himself Type of Job,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is not busy, but steady. I spend my hours taking bill payments, cashing checks, and wiring money. Although this job has taught me a great deal in regards to cash handling and data entry, it seems to become a bit mundane. Our management team is not the most open and available bunch, but they do what they can for their associates. My co-workers are not much interested in helping their fellow associates, while I, on the other hand, try hard to make sure that all of my co-workers are up to par on their duties. The hardest part of the job is your occasional irate customer, who seems like every solution you offer is of no benefit to them. The most enjoyable part is the employee safety incentives and the overall friendly atmosphere.",2,Current Employee,customer service cashier ,"Harvey, LA",5/1/12,2012,5,1

Walmart is just too big for it's own good..,"Management was the biggest issue. They do not communicate with eachother or with their employees. They never have enough people staffed for any position in the store. They don't care about what you do or how hard you work as long as the job is done. I've worked there for a couple of years and they have never once really noticed the amount of blood, sweat and tears I have put into my working there. I get so exhausted trying to keep up with there ridiculous expectations of my job title that I am just tired of not being appreciated or advancing.",2,Current Employee,Cashier and Customer Service Representative ,"Buford, GA",4/30/12,2012,4,30
Very good company to work for,"Typical day at work: Start by pulling all the pallets to the floor and opening them. Hang all clothes on appropriate racks, and change sales prices if need be. At the end of the night set up new displays for the next day, pull pallets back to the storage department and make sure store was clean for the next day. I learned the meaning of hard labor. The management there could have been better, because for the shift they seem to be a little to laid back. They seem to play around a lot and didn’t always provide us with the knowledge we needed complete all the task correct the first time. The co-works were for the most part pretty good people to work with we always helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was getting use to the hours and the intense labor. The most enjoyable part was learning about different merchandise.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"San Diego, CA",4/30/12,2012,4,30
"While enjoyable, it's not that great","Wal-Mart always claims to be a ""family"" company; but the moment you need time off for a family emergency, you get written up. A typical day at work was fast-paced and energetic, but stressful also. Management sucked. They were never willing to help and when they did, they berated you. They refused to work with schedule changes or time off. My co-workers were great--mostly. The hardest part of the job was remaining calm and patient and keeping a smile on my face when I just didn't want to.

Stressfull place to work,I have worked for Walmart Stores Inc for the past 81/2 years and have noticed a slow decline in its values. It is no longer a family oriented company. Management is on the decline as well. The company is not big on promoting from within the company as it should. It instead hires personnel just because they have obtained a degree of some sorts with no knowledge of the company's policies and procedures. This method of hiring is promoting low moral within the store. A typical wokday is filled with shortages in every department with overworked employees. Management is lazy and biligerant to the employees. There is no teamwork beause no one cares. The hardest part of the job for most employees is work schedules. Some employees are overworked while others are getting their hours cut. There has even been a death of an employee because of poor scheduling. Another is employee passed because of unecessary coaching procedures. The most enjoyable part of the day is when it's time to clock out.,1,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Memphis, TN",4/30/12,2012,4,30

"Nice, safe, and fun environment to work in.","A typical day at Wal-Mart Distribution Center begins with a start-up meeting where we are inform of a safety topic and the volume for the day. Orderfillers are responsible for selecting cases for store orders. Depending on the volume determines how many hours you get that day. I've learned how to drive a RSR Lift and a center rider. I've also learn how to stack cases properly to be shipped to the stores undamaged. I've learn how to work well with my co-workers on a respectful and fun level. The management team is a pleasure to work for. My co-workers are fun, hardworking, and safe at what they do. The hardest thing about my job is dealing with lazy ppl., The most enjoyable part about my job is knowing at the end of the day I did my best to service the customer productively and safely.",4,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Robert, LA",4/29/12,2012,4,29

Making a customer happy that couldn't afford his/her medicine. Providing a simple discount card to help out with the bill.,"A typical day at work for me: 1st when I get to work I see how many are in the fill que before we open, then I start fill those. I have learned over the years that I'm only one person and I can only do what I can in the amount of time that I'm there. For the most part so of my co-workers are lazy. I do enjoy working with them, but I expect everybody should do their part when they are there. The hardest part about my job is seeing people that truly can not afford there medicine.

Easy with its days,"I loved my job. The work was easy. Yet, like any other work place it had its days. A typical day would be me and at times another co-worker (I was full-time, they were part-time) would open the office. We would do our daily routines from start to finish. We had certain deadlines we had to meet on a daily basis. We had daily paper work for management to sign. Once that was done we could file that paperwork. My management team was good. There were great managers, then there were managers who I personally felt they could care less about their staff. There were also the managers that would say or do one thing and turn around and do or say another. Since I have lost my job working with Wal-Mart, I have learned to trust nobody. I knew that before Wal-Mart. However, due to certain managers that work at Wal-Mart, I do not feel I will ever be in the position I am in now - jobless. There was not really a hard part of work. The hardest thing for me was certain circumstances arose and at times it became hard for me to get to work at 5a.m. on top of a 45 minute car drive one way. These circumstances have since been taken care of. The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers and customers. I had an amazing co-worker who shared the office with me. I just hope there is someone else out there as amazing as she was that I can get to know and work aside.

My co-workers were great to work with and we worked well together.

"Great advancement opportunities, but demanding work environment","Walmart have plenty of opportunities for any employee who wants to advance. The only issue is that employees have to be in the right place at the right time in order to get noticed. A typical workday includes working in several areas with tight resources, and limited time. Management can be very demanding, but some of them will do their best at providing the support needed to complete the tasks. Co-workers are great to work with.

I learned that time management is critical, and you can't always make a plan and stick to it, you need to be very flexible. Politics are more abundant the closer you get to the top of management. Teamwork is the key to a business' success. Co-workers always had their own agenda. The hardest part of the job was not being able to follow the plan you put together for the day.

It was alright.,"Being a cashier at Walmart is an interesting experience. The pay was decent for me since I was going to school still when I was working there but it's not really enough for what you have to deal with from customers. The store that I worked at the customers are ignorant. I had one customer insinuate that I'm stupid and that's why I worked at Walmart when she was the one that was giving me far too much money and was going to receive most of the money back.I constantly got a stomach virus while working there and received a verbal warning due to missing work so much due to the stomach virus. The icing on the cake was when one of the assistant managers told me to make doctor appointments on days I had school and not during work days. Needless to say, I quit a week later.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tampa, FL",4/26/12,2012,4,26

"Down to earth Co-workers, with questionable management.","My day at work begins with clocking in, going to the backroom to prepare it for a truck unload. Once we are set up someone opens the door to the truck and we begin the unload process. After finishing the truck which takes anywhere between 2-4 hours, we go on a 15 minute break and depending on the time we either help in other departments of the store such as the pets area, or we go to lunch (if it's nearing 8 PM). From there we come back pull out the pallets of freight we stacked from unloading the truck to their designated department, clean up the back room, and finally are sent to a department to work for the rest of the night. That is also the time we can be pulled to do other tasks that our co-workers need help with.Management is questionable to me, for the simple reason they do not listen to their subordinates, or care about anything other than if something is done or not. A good example of this would be a day when on average you have 6 unloaders working, and 4 call in leaving 2 to do the job; they will still expect you to do the work of 6 people with no help. Another would be when you are honestly working hard, you have 4 pallets of freight to work, You get 3 of the 4 done and still get chewed out for not finishing the one, despite your best efforts. The hardest part of the job to me is throwing the truck which has about 2000 pieces of merchandise in it as fast you can.Co-workers are all friendly and help each other out when asked, and seem almost like family when talking.

The beginning of my career.,"I would get to work around 10 p.m.. We had a lot of IMS people quit and a lot of stockers quit time and time again, so I had two full time jobs. First I would go to the back and pick out all the picks for the night and unload all the trucks and drop the pallets in the desired places. I would go out afterwards and help finish downstacking. After downstacking was over, I would rotate between helping stock and working in IMS binning the back stock. If I was able to finish IMS early, I would go back out on the floor and stock some more or help zone. At some points the whole store only had 3-5 employees between cashiers/stockers/ and IMS, some nights we didn't get out till 9:00 am in the morning. I would train the new people as well, help coach on stocking techniques or teach IMS. My co-workers had to be the best part of the job. The hardest part of my job was having to be in 3 or 4 places at one time. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people and learning how to do all the things that were expected of me. Everyone tried really hard, 2 people of management still thought it wasn't good enough, but the rest of them were pleased with the overall dedication and how much got accomplished between just a few people. I learned how to be responsible there, how to manage my time better and to become very adaptable. I had no problem taking on the extra work, I understood, I just wish instead of everyone always being threatened to do more, that instead a simple ""thank you"" or ""good job"" would have been great.

You need to be willing to change a task and work on what is needed for the customer and store. The people I work with have great ideas at times and are willing to help others with a given task. The managers for a store change often. The moves are due to company demands. The new managers come in with many new ideas. Some are great and some are not. They treat people with respect and let the team voice ideas for creating a better shopping experience for the customer. The hardest part of the job is several managers on one task and they all have different ideas as to how they want it completed .

I worked there for eight years and ten months, and finally after about seven and-a-half years of working daytime as a cashier, I was promoted to the overnights as Customer Service Manager, when I worked at that position for ten months, and then I was laid off.

I was retaliated against for reporting illegal activities to government agencies, and their own Loss Prevention/Asset Protection Co-ordinator for their own Asset Protection Division was a police officer, who gave no help in saving my job. The pay is very high, but insurance is not good; the co-pays are too high. At the time when I was working there, the pay raises were excellent, and the advancement opportunities were excellent, but only if you wanted to forfeit having downtime and personal time in your own life for self-maintenance. Assistant Managers' shifts rotate and are not flexible. The ability to transfer to other departments within the stores are not easy, as I was a daytime cashier for seven and-a-half years.

A Fairly Good Place To Work....Most Of The Time,"If you genuinely like working along side friendly, team-oriented people, Walmart is a good place to work. Most of the employees that work here always make an effort to do the very best at what they do. Working here, I truly learned the importance of always providing good customer service on a daily basis.HOWEVER, the employee moral in this type of retail environment is VARIABLE. Depending whom your store manager is, theirassistants, etc. Sometimes it can vary from spectacular to horrible.It's great place to work for college students. They will definitely work around your school schedule. The hardest part of the job is keep your self motivated on daily basis, because they don't make a lot of effort here towards showing appreciation toward their employees.The employees that work here are generally ""invisible"", unless they do something wrong. Again, this is ONLY dependent whom your store management team is. I have had plenty positive experiences with management, as well. Your customers and co-workers will ALWAYS appreciate you here, no matter what store you work at. The most enjoyable part of the job would be just simply working in customer friendly environment.

All in all, Wal-mart was there when I needed them the most when the economy was and still is down, they will have your back if you have their back.

"Love the job, hate the company.","I was hired to be a cake decorator at the Walmart in Piqua, Ohio in July of last year. Starting out, I did love the job, specifically decorating cakes which was my job. However, the longer I work for Walmart, the longer I dislike my management and the company as a whole.Walmart hires managers who do not have experience in all the jobs they're overseeing. This becomes a problem as The managers expect you to do too much work, and work that isn't in your own job description.Walmart is also very big on ""the open door policy"", which basically is where they say any one associate has the ability to speak to their higher-ups directly to improve their working conditions. I'm here to say, this method fails miserably. Any time I have tried to use this policy, my higher-ups basically say I need to work it out myself.Another problem with Walmart is their leniency for asking for time off, and sick days. Walmart has a 3 day sick day policy that is in effect every six months. If you go over the 3 days, you get a verbal warning. However, if you miss three consecutive work days in a row, they'll consider it one sick day. You can see where this can be problematic. If you are sick for a work day, come back to work, and then still must miss a day, that is two of your sick days counted. However, if you were to be sick one day, and then just call off the next two, only one day is counted.The last issues I have with Walmart is the amount of people they hire for each department, and how they train those newly hired. When you're first hired at Walmart, you must spend hours in a computer lab doing - more...",2,Current Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Piqua, OH",4/18/12,2012,4,18

Handling everything cheap; not just the prices,"They don't pay well, the benefits aren't very good, and the managers almost seem detached from the employees. You have to wait a lot longer to qualify for a raise and benefits than you would for most companies. It isn't easy to schedule time off, and there's no guarantee you'll get the time off that you requested.

Too Bad......So Sad,"Thats how I felt the day I left. I was an associate for WalMart for over 12 years. I had a wonderful relationship with my fellow associates and management.....so I thought. I was moving out of state, and wanted to transfer to a WalMart in my new location. OMG !! It was like pulling teeth to get help. I asked management to help me, personnell manager to help me & nothing....I kept being told ""I'll help you find the information you need"" or ""I'll look into it for you"" or (my favorite saying) ""I'll get back to you"". And nothing ! No help from any of them. I even called the store I wanted to transfer too, hard to believe...they did the same thing ""I'll call you back"" and they didn't. I went onto the wire & put in for a transfer & no one would follow through with it. It was like....too bad, so sad.....if I didn't stay with this WalMart I couldn't go to any. And that's what happened....management took so long to get their act together, when I got to my new home & went to the local WalMart...I was told it was too late. I had to reapply and start all over again, at part time with less pay and a lower position. This just proves, you cannot be loyal to a company like WalMart, they don't care about their associates at all. Thanks to them, I wasted 12 years and am now unemployed. Maybe someone of importance will read these reviews and make some needed changes to this company.",1,Former Employee,ZMS ,NJ,4/18/12,2012,4,18
A Typical Day at Work,"Working at Wal-Mart is a hand full. This cashier job consist of dealing with lots of different types of customers and employees.

I learned a lot there, how to face an aisle, how to count drawers, and even a little of the customer service desk.

"Productive, calm","I worked in three different areas at this job I started out as a cashier, within 6 months of working I was promoted to customer service desk. I worked this position for 6 months and then promoted to the accounting office. As a cashier would ring up customer's groceries and bag them with the biggest smile I could give them. I was given cashier of the month once too. When I worked at the customer service desk, it was horrible. The customers were rude, and we had to honor our motto, ""The customer is always right"". I didn't like that but I had to do whatever I could to satisfy a customer without calling a manager. When I began to work in the accounting office, I thought I was in heaven. I worked with one other lady and we didn't have to see or hear customers complaints unless we came out of the office.I didn't really like the hours in the accounting office but I learned to adjust, the hardest part of this job was not being able to balance out a room full of thousands of dollars and your shift is almost over.The thing I liked most about this job was the people I worked with, and it was a easy job overall,",4,Former Employee,Accounting Clerk ,"Rome, GA",4/17/12,2012,4,17

I am always dealing with insurances denying covering a customers medication and when I am able to work with the doctor or insurance company and get the medication covered or changed and satisfy the customer, it gives me joy when I am thanked.

Worse Job!,"I'd advise no one to ever work for Wal-mart unless you are management or office personnel. Out of all three different Wal-mart stores I have worked at, in 6 consecutive years, unfortunately every store is the same! I relocated several times to find this out. Managers are very favortism, unfair, and it shows! You will not get promoted based on skills and qualifications, but on which manager favors you the most. If you do a good job you will not be noticed but if you mess up oh yes they notice this instantly! The pay is a joke! Sure it is a tad bit more than mininum wage, however the long 9 (yes nine) hours, the actual work load, and the nonsense you have to deal with on a daily basis from co-workers, managers, and customers; it is definitely not worth the stress or lousy pay!! Wal-mart does not take care of its employees and does not intend to do so! Yes this job was the most stressful job I've had and I absolutely hated it!

"a outgoing, place with many different opportunities","typical night at work consisted of being assigned to certain area of store. We were expected to restock shelves in orderly manner. We were given a certain amount of time to get our work done. We clocked in to our area at beginning of dututy and clocked out at end of finishing the area. Then we were sent to next area. If we did not get our work finished in the time assigned, we had to explain to our supervisior why. After several times of not having a valid reason, we would be written up. This gave us the opportunity to learn time managent, as well as better ways to work. The management team that I worked for were very reasonable. They would work with the employees to see what was needed to improve your job. You could go to them if you had a problem, and they would try to help. My co-workers were very nice. We would all work together to help each other.

Co-workers were great to work with as long as they listened to direction and came to work on time.Hardest part of job? I really don't think there was one but, if there was I would have to say making sure we had the correct size of shelving and putting it in the right areas.Most enjoyable part of the job was, for one it let me work overnights so I could spend time with family and still do stuff around the American Legion. I gave me time to do thing during the day that I would not have otherwise.

Anyone that has left or got fired can only come back if they kiss managements' BUTTS. Then they make you start over on probation even if you worked the department your in now. No one is ever there.

Poor management,Show too much favortism towards certain people and step on or around other employees especially the persons that are slower in speed to get the work done..Poor training/management thinks that showing someone a 10 min lesson on learning how to run a cash register should be sufficient enough and that person who has never run a cash register should be able to work on thier own and have management turn around and say you dont have what it takes to do this job,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Saint Helens, OR",4/16/12,2012,4,16

The absolute worst job I've ever had period!,I am an electronics specialist who was sent to houseware? I also unloaded a truck by myself (because the people that are actually paid to unload the truck wouldn't do it) on one of the hottest days of the summer. I was fired for mixing paint for a customer nobody else would mix paint for. Management did not support me taking college courses. If I had a choice between Sitting at home and Walmart? With Walmart being the only place in the world that a person could work at? I'd choose to sit at home. PS: They still owe me $90!,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"DeSoto, TX",4/15/12,2012,4,15
Had a good job experience.,"Working hard and making the day go by, how to do customer service. Managment is very strict but does a good job. Workers we very nice and worked well with each other.

Not so good,"If you are a brown noser....you'll go far. If you suck up...not only will you get promotions, but you won't get coached. While other associates that work harder and don't suck up or brown nose will go no-where, get coached and given more assignments. Management contributes to the gossip and rumors throughout the store. The personnell manager will discuss your pay or personal information with other associates. Store manager was more interested in who will go on a cigarette break with her then how her store is running. More assistant managers have quit in this store in the past year then any other store. And if you don't text the store manager with daily gossip or tattleing....she gets p.o.'d at you. I NEVER worked in a store where the store manager wanted everyone to rat everone else out. And if you didn't run to her with gossip, you were not liked & she would make your day miserable. Not a friendly work environment.",1,Former Employee,Front End ,"Newton, NJ",4/15/12,2012,4,15
Fast moving environment that it always changing.,"Walk my areas and identify areas of opportunity that need to be fixed fast. Check for completion of the closing tasks the night before. Assign tasks to associates to completed through their shift. Take part in the area meeting to discuss the focus of the day. Complete the required compliance tasks and begin prep for the next day. Every day is a challenge! It's like chopping a tree down with a spoon. In the short term it seems useless, but in the long term you will fell the tree. The best part of the job is watching my areas grow into profitable parts of the store and watching my associates achieve more and eventually promote.",3,Current Employee,Merchandise Supervisor ,"Centerville, UT",4/15/12,2012,4,15
"Great place to work, but favoritism is very common","A typical day at work at the Bristol walmart was setting up your register, cashing out customers, and helping take care of overstock on the downtime. It was generally a fun place to work. I learned to work fast, without sacrificing quality of work and working with many people at once.The only complaint I ever had with my Walmart store was that the managers either played favorites with the higher up employees or they completely ignored you all together. None of the managers knew any of the cashier or stockers names by memory, they were rude to all the workers in front of customers, and they were even rude to customers!The hardest part of working at Walmart is not being able to help customers in all situations. Sometimes there is something wrong with a product that customers need fixed, or a product that is no longer on the shelf and there is nothing we can do to help them find it and they leave upset. But the most enjoyable part of the job was most definitely the atmosphere. Aside from very few minor customer/worker problems in the time I worked there, it was a very happy environment. The other cashiers were friendly and down to earth and the customers were all usually very polite and easy to wait on.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bristol, CT",4/15/12,2012,4,15

"Easy job, low pay, and bad management.","My typical day included stocking, rotating old and new stock, and assisting customers. I learned how to read barcodes to put stock away. The management was unhelpful, and and bossy instead of helping in a leadership role. My co-workers were great people who were closeknit. The hardest part was trying to stock areas I wasn't familiar with. Most enjoyable part was working with the public.",3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Dry Ridge, KY",4/15/12,2012,4,15

Usually understaffed,"At least an eight hour work day that is busy with work, customers, and stocking. I learned that the customer is always right. Management would help out occasionally if the lines were backed up. Loved all the co-workers we all helped one another to make the workday go by smoothly. The hardest part of the job was not getting a proper break, and it being really hot. The best part is a 40hr work week because lets face it, times are hard.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Smithfield, NC",4/15/12,2012,4,15

Goal Driven with a purpose,"A typical day at Walmart doesn't compare to your regular ""Run of the mill company"" everyday expect something different that would test your limits of going above to please the customer. Over the years of employment with Walmart I've have learn how to be the best leader i could be, by first of all being attentive to the needs of other rather then myself and to have a keen sense to grasp ideas of what management required of me to be a boniafide Leader and to learn to work as a family unit with the co- workers to get the task done at hand. The hardest part of the job at Walmart for me was to have a customer walk out the store because a item that they want wasn't on the self at that time and i would have done everything to make sure that it wouldn't be a next time, because that item would be ordered in a rush fashion that i would keep the customer in commication regarding their item. The most enjoyable part of the Job at Walmart would have to be the people and what i mean by people i am taking about the employee as well as the customers whom had made a very personal impact in my life from the time i first i walked through their doors i seen so much growth in indiviuals that carried them into jobs of futher advancement.",4,Former Employee,Dept Mgr ,"Norwalk, CT",4/15/12,2012,4,15

Not Negotiable,"I was a cashier and a sales associate, I learned how to handle money, work with customers, the management was good but not great.

I learned how to be more patient not only with customers, but with peers and myself as well. Also, managing tasks alone with out assistance was another major contribution I attained. My co-workers were all great, made coming to work worth it. We were all like family. Management i feel isn't the best, they aren't as involved as you would like them to be, but are really good about getting tasks done quickly as well. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you were able to assist customers in their needs and them being greatful of the help provided.

My Daily Work Consist Of Cashiering, Unloading Trucks, Cell Phone Activation, Photo Processing, Dot Com Pickups, and Keeping Up With The Toy Department. All Of This I Don't Mind Because It Keeps Me Busy and I'm Not Just In One Place All Day. My Issue With This Company Is That It Is Very Unorganized. There Is No Chain Of Command. Everyone Wants To Be In Charge and It Ends Up Becoming A Head Ache. The Pay Is Awful and The Only Way To Actually Make Some Decent Money Is To Be Full Time Which They Don't Believe In. Asking Management To Adjust or Fix Your Schedule Is Like Pulling Teeth With Your Fingers.

Good company just not for everyone.,In a typical day I would over-see the work of over a 100 associates along with daily reports and deposits. I would also deal with customer situations and do coaching for improvments when needed.Being with Walmart for 6 years taught me a lot not only in retail but also in managment. While with Walmart I did complete a eight week management training course. This helped in learning how to manage so many differnet tasks at one time and becoming a pro at time managment.I honestly can say I would still be there if they were still the same company when I started. When first starting there they had a care for their employees and sadly in the years I watched that disappear. I feel that any employer needs to understand that you do have a life/family outside of your job and you need to have a good balance of that. I understand that there are times you are going to need to work over and get the job done. I'm my situation I was working 15-18 hour days and coming in on my days off. It just comes to a point when enough is enough.For the most part I can honestly say that did enjoy working at Walmart. I love working with people and being in a fast pace enviroment.

Good.,"I like working at Walmart. The environment is a pleasant one and co-workers are very friendly. Only complaint is management doesn't always do what they say they are going to do, and sometimes take forever to change things in the system.some of the harder parts of working at Walmart is the lifting and bending over especially since I am pregnant. And since it is walmart, not very many ""soft"" jobs their.I like working with the customers and learning new things. I enjoy working their, or any where at that.
