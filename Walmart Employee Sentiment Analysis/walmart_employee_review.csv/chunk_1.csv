"Great Coworkers, Annoying Coaches ","The management could use improvement, often felt like it was so disorganized. Also, coaches don't care about associates. Great coworkers make it better, met a lot of amazing people here. Of course, working food and consumables are always going to suck. However, if you work the closing shift, expect a little more freedom, and for the second half of your shift, you'll generally be sent to go-backs, which aren't so bad. For the first half of your shift, you can be sent to do anything, like stocking meat, produce, or produce, as well as doing happy to help. Also, the food and consumables department is very short-staffed, expect to deal with customers angry that an item is out of stock. The happy-to-help department is also very short staffed so be prepared for angry customers that are tired of waiting for assistance with getting locked items. Not everyone has a key which just makes everything so much worse. ",4,Former Employee,Food and Consumables Associate ,"Richmond, CA",4/29/23,2023,4,29

There's no communication between the shift leaders, and if something is communicated it's never enforced.

Underpaid and Management severely lacking ,Walmart is underpaid and you are asked to go above and beyond the amount of compensation you recieve. Working as a cashier you are told to harass customers to take a 5 Star survey at the end or of each transaction. If the store scores low they blame the cashiers for not pushing the survey instead of actually addressing the issues as to why the numbers are low. E are also told to have our work phones in our hands at all times. Giving the apperance to customers we are on our own phones not paying attention. Management does little to nothing as they are always in the back in the office. Only coming out when higher ups are making a visit. They guilt trip you if you have any schedule changes. You won't get two consistent days off.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Hudson, WI",4/29/23,2023,4,29
Good job bad management,"If your looking for something reliable this is a great job but the management makes the job toxic. They have unrealistic expectations for example I worked in pets I would be expected to put up about 10-15 L-carts worth of freight while the truck is being unloaded and about 6-15 dog food bag pallets and break packs, now I get it doesn’t seem like that much work, honestly your right but this is where the toxic management comes into play, the department managers around the store never have their aisle in order or located in the system correctly so when you use your scanner you find out that they have “plugged the stop” and at the store I was at I wasn’t allowed to make new price tags I worked second shift so after my first hour the department manager was gone for the day. So your say well I need to tell somebody about this and be a good little employee, nope you tell your manager the problem and they go to the department manager saying your complaining about how the department is ran causing frustration with the department manager even though they are aware of the problem and have done nothing to fix it. Now your sitting there with the short end of the stick upper management doesn’t care they just backstabbed everybody to get to that position if you think I’m lying ask somebody who worked at Walmart I’m sure there’s a few exceptions but for the most part they are terrible people.

A joke,"Too much tools completely unusefull and ridiculous  ( phone apps). Completely conter productive. It leads to a segregation by the faster phone you own. Most of the guys who works there for more than one or two years spent more than 1000 $ on their phone. The walmart device (phone) is a shame slower than my 200 $ phone just because they put a ""Spyware"" in it (knot)  to make statistics  on you . all is about micro management and the way you look on the video while working. People got so much pressure than they prefer to look overexhausted and fast paced on the video doing something that has already be done or anything else completely unusefull than to have results and save energy by team working. Communication, the key, is simply inexistant precisely because of that huge pressure they put on their employees . The official walmart policy is team work, excellence, yadi Yada and now we sing like in a Disney moovie. But all their process is about dividing people with demagogy for more competition between employees. It doesn't work. ",2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"New York, NY",4/29/23,2023,4,29

Striving workplace and very fun ,At Walmart working 8 hours goes by fast. You always have something to do that isn't too hard because all employees work together to make sure everything is organized and accurate to always set out on its next mission. The main bosses and managers would always stop by to check on you and make sure everyone was doing a fair amount of work with great pay and benefits. They would also do little challenges to push their employees to do and get more out of the job I think was very rewarding. ,4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Bozeman, MT",4/29/23,2023,4,29
Questionable Leadership,"Some coaches'll snap at you over minor things, show favoritism, and whatnot. They're not shy to abuse their position.  My previous location had the same issue, but much worse.  The overnight coach straight up told us it was their goal to make their position obsolete, because they wanted us to be able to take care of everything on our own. They spent most of their time strolling around the store, hands tucked in their front pockets. Coworkers are great though. They make the job manageable at my new location.

All management does is brown nose the store lead and upper management, walk around the store, and pretend like they actually do something. They treat you like dirt on the rare occasion they take the time to speak to you and they never compliment or offer a reward to a job well done. The pay is not merit-based, bonuses are non-existent, and they treat you like a replaceable peon from the moment you walk through the door. The only way you can get a raise is by getting a promotion and the process for getting one is panel-based.

Fast paced business environment that leaves absolutely no room for any employee appreciation.,"Though this corporation offers great benefits to adult employees, as my time working as a minor there, I received absolutely none of this. Due to my age, I wasn't allowed to work overtime, nor setup a 401k, and despite this setup leaving me barely scraping for ends meat, I would come in every day and give this company my all. In the end though, it never mattered to Walmart. No matter how many sales you help make, how many times you fight to have a positive customer interaction despite the despicable environment, they will cut you the second they have new faces to bring into the company. That is how much respect a corporation such as this has for their associates. They pick and choose who gets to bend the rules. Associates smoke in aisles, management takes goods without paying, certain employees are far past retirement age, and are busting away every day to make ends meet at Walmart. This is no healthy place to work. If all else fails, and you are REALLY scrounging for money, I still wouldn't recommend anybody put themselves through the pain that is working with Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Digital shopper ,"Lancaster, CA",4/26/23,2023,4,26

Mixed Experience,"Pay is good as long as you don’t stay stagnant in one position/store. Lack of respect for employees is stressful especially when a lot of management has less experience at the job than the employee. Depending on the store favoritism can make or break your experience as well.Early morning is the best grocery picker shift due to lack of customers and well stocked shelves, but is often (understandably, as long as they do their job well) reserved for senior employees. Also, if you hate mornings and want mid shifts another position may be better depending on how your store views procedures. If they expect you to look everywhere for an item, get with management, etc. it can be physically and mentally exhausting. I’ve been in tears before trying to find a manager while getting interrupted by customers looking for stuff as well.If you are hired on as a dispenser expect a lot of physical work and movement. Totes often weigh more than you expect due to multiple gallons of milk/water or something like cat litter. You will deal with more problem solving as well due to people misplacing totes, losing labels or customers/delivery drivers having order issues, get to know the system well as soon as you can.Work life balance also greatly depends on your management. For the most part you get enough PPTO (protected paid time off) to cover for anything, but expect them to hold it against you in various ways even if you go out of your way to pick up the slack or stay late to help thinking that will “make up for” the times you couldn’t be there.If you’re going into full-time just be sure - more...",3,Former Employee,OGP Associate ,Texas,4/26/23,2023,4,26

Unnessary Drama with poor Market Leadership,"As a Coach, I truly love my job. Unfortunately, all my leads get pushed out as soon as they try to hold people accountable with ethics cases. Years ago it was completely different. Associates today will run you ragged being disrespectful with poor performance as they know they can get you written up or terminated with a false ethics case. Also, tasks cannot be completed as associates have learned how to manipulate PPTO to come in late so many days a week or put in on key event days.  There needs to be more experience in the market teams, we have mostly younger men with little to no idea of the diverse communities and departments we have.

All associates who I have spoken to have either felt like they're never actually heard or recognized for most of the work they've contributed for the company. Management sucks so good luck looking for a manager or a higher-position lead anywhere when you need them the most. They allow in just about everyone to come through those company doors, which made me feel unsafe and explained a lot of my former co-workers desensitized-like behaviors. We're not allowed to refuse service to rude or even harassing customers because that would ""escalate"" or ""instigate"" a situation. We were told that yes we are allowed to defend ourselves by minimal physical efforts as much as possible and encouraged to run if anything. Yup.Other than that the job itself is super easy and manageable when you're not getting reamed at or thrown impossible lists of things to do before your shift ends. Maybe its just this store.

I have had construction retirees and national guardsmen quit for it being too hard on them.What most people don't realize is that each store is run on it's own finances. Theft, shrink, etc comes out of the same money paychecks are paid with. So please don't take corporate earnings as how well your local walmart does. Either as customer or associate (we don't have the same rights as employees) how you'll be treated can be incredibly different than another one just down the road. That said, corporate makes all decisions on what products are carried at what time of year such as sending swimsuits and nixing shovels in the middle of midwest blizzard season.

Not the company you think it is.,"A typical day in homeoffice included answering phones, working issues other associates are having, and collaborating with several teams to resolve problems. What I've learned in my time here is the culture within Walmart is very different than its customer face. Management has free range to treat any associate any way they feel is better for the company. It is well known by the associates that the core beliefs have become more like the core suggestions. Values that are dropped at the slightest provocation. Standards salaried members of management that are allowed, and encouraged, to treat any associate with as much discrimination or other ill-treatment that is required to increase the teams productivity. I absolutely love talking to customers and resolving their issues, or teaching them how to resolve their own issues. This however is seen as removing the possibility for more ""tickets"" in the team and is highly discouraged. There are good managers who have the best interests of their associates at heart, but in my opinion they are far and few removed from the overall culture at Walmart homeoffice.

Easy Money if you play your cards right,"- You a guaranteed 40 hours a week without a doubt if you're hired as a full time associate- Work schedule is very flexible and the PTO system is easily understandable and easy to use- PTO works on a hours worked rewards hours off basis and there is also a Protected PTO system separate from that that works on the same merit however it's a fixed rate whereas PTO becomes faster to obtain the longer you are there. PTO is used for days requested off in advance however you can request days off unpaid anyway if you don't have the PTO.- Call offs work on a points system and that's where Protected PTO comes into play. If you need to call off you can submit Protected PTO for that day and you will be paid for it as well as not have the call off count against you.There are two routes to succeeding here:A: You keep to yourself and just do your work as needed but stay an AssociateOr B: Make friends with everyone, especially anyone in management. Build connections. Go above and beyond from time to time. Just be generally good at your job, friendly, and reliable and you will move up fairly fast especially if you vocalize that you're interested.Very important thing at this company is to be a good judge of management because while most of mine have been great people, every company has its person that shouldn't have the position they do. People play favorites here. It's a ""don't hate the player hate the game"" kind of situation. You can't beat, or change it. However, the ""game"" is easy if you're just friendly and reliable.

If team leads don't like you they will make it their mission to fire you, but others can no call no show and still have a job.

There is very little incentive to stay.,"If you want a promotion, you need to be adequate. Any more than that, and you'll be stuck because they can't replace you. Any less, and you'll be stuck because they don't value you.Most of the leads and managers are good people, but the company needs to learn that an asset is more than merchandise. Every position is understaffed, and it's a combination of people calling out because they need a break from being overworked and underpaid, and the company firing people because they called out. As a whole, the company is completely ridiculous. However, the work itself is fine.Some things you'll hear from the leadership, and their translation: ""I'll see what I can do."" = [I don't know how to tell you it will never happen.]""I've got it covered!"" = [I should've listened when you told me 3 months ago.]""It shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes..."" = [I have absolutely no clue how long that task really takes.]""It took me one hour to finish what I tasked you with yesterday!"" = [I literally threw 80% in the trash and intentionally misidentified the rest, but I still need someone to blame.] ",3,Former Employee,Claims Associate ,"El Cajon, CA",4/21/23,2023,4,21

Don't work here unless it's your last resort.,No one that works here is appreciated. Management is clicky and always blaming the people that work the hardest for their own ego fueled failures. The start of each shift involves a meeting where they fake smile and act nice while telling everyone how worthless they are to the company. You will work yourself to the bone and have less and less energy each day you come in. Safety means nothing. Most equipment is old and worn out and doesn't even work half the time. Don't bother bringing questions or concerns to management. They never have answers and don't care if you drop dead on the job.

Great place to work if you’re lucky enough to get good management ,They are not a bad company to work for provided you get lucky enough to have good management. in many instances they would rather hire someone out of store or out of department with no previous experience of the role than promoting people who have been working towards the promotion and know the position inside and out.,4,Former Employee,Team Leader in Training ,"Lucedale, MS",4/20/23,2023,4,20
We Are Struggling ,"My experience was full of both good and bad times. I really enjoyed my coworkers as well as getting to know my customers, and the work is a good workout! Yet the majority was very unpleasant, which was mostly due to high work loads with low pay (and this company is the highest paying in my area)! Managers and higher ups did not help my experience besides a very slight few. They are actually the reason I'm ultimately leaving the company, and had to leave two years ago when I previously worked here! There were part time workers receiving full time hours without getting benefits or classified as a full time worker, meanwhile full time workers were getting hours cut and told it would continue into summertime! Nightshifts pay is $15.50 with no bonuses, so until the additional $2 beach store raise hits, many employees are living paycheck to paycheck and are lucky to be able to pay their rent, and these are full time employees!! There are workers who have been there for decades and making less than workers just coming in. The pay is unfair, the work conditions are unfair and management receives any and all praise their associates work hard for! My store is 574, and I truly hope things change so Walmart can continue to have workers. ",1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Myrtle Beach, SC",4/20/23,2023,4,20

But then, they were frustrated with me because I'm not a robot and the responsibilities were stressing me out because I was told to take care of my jobs, the other Co-Workers jobs that were left for me to do after they went home and left for me to do, and that it was my responsibility if the Deli was closed down because I needed help, with more responsibilities and not enough time to accomplish everything, and it got to a point where I wasn't able to physically close at 100%. Even though I spoke openly of the situations, nothing changed and I was on over-load.Workplace culture was unstable.The hardest part of the job was getting the help where we all were working as a team, as a whole, to make the Deli 100% on a daily basis.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the Customers leave happy and when the job was done at 100%.",3,Former Employee,Walmart Deli Associate ,"4901 Dartmouth College Hwy, Woodsville, NH 03785",4/19/23,2023,4,19

They got rid of quarterly bonuses, now it's only for leads and salaried...The same leads that will tell you he or she can't stand you at times. Same lead who will tell another associate who wants to keep there pay if they transfer they will see what they can do. After you mention that you never got to, same lead says well that's because no body likes you. You can report it but Walmart don't care about you.

fun ,"Working at Walmart can be a mixed bag, depending on your personal preferences and experiences. On the positive side, the company offers competitive wages and benefits, including health insurance and a 401(k) plan, even for entry-level positions. Walmart also provides opportunities for career advancement, with many employees starting in hourly roles and moving up to management positions.However, the work environment at Walmart can be fast-paced and demanding, with long shifts and a high volume of customers to serve. Additionally, some employees have reported feeling overworked and underappreciated, with a lack of support from management. The company has also faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of wage theft and discrimination.Ultimately, whether working at Walmart is a positive or negative experience will depend on your individual circumstances and priorities. If you value stability, competitive pay, and opportunities for advancement, Walmart may be a good fit for you. However, if you are looking for a more relaxed or supportive work environment, you may want to consider other options.",3,Current Employee,Doorman ,"Portland, OR",4/18/23,2023,4,18

The worst place ever. Overworked. Underpaid. Understaffed. ,"The management is the number one issue, it is comprised of people who do not care about anybody except themselves. You will be constantly asked to do more than what is possible in a given time frame. You will be understaffed to handle the work load so prepare to do the work of 2-3 people. No overtime is allowed and if you do accidentally go into overtime you will be made to take extended lunches in order to burn off the time. The management only cares about metrics & numbers (because the metrics reflect their quarterly bonuses). They expected us to have $200+ grocery orders put together and out the door in less than 3-4 minutes when we had a 350ft+ walk to get from our staging area to the parking lot where the customers pick up the orders. We didn’t have enough equipment to do our jobs properly. When asked what they can do to help us get the wait times down they completely ignored everything that myself and many other associates offered up as ideas & they simply expected us to work harder.Instead they asked us to cheat the system and sign off on the orders before we even get outside to confirm the customers identity. We were constantly expected to go and help other departments whenever we were asked & had no choice in the matter even if it left our department struggling to get our own job done. This was a daily occurrence I worked Online Grocery the entire time I was there and yet I know how to stock, zone, run equipment, unload truck & do many other jobs around the store.

The job, for me, was taking orders out to customers and loading them into their vehicle. It was chill, everyone had a good time, and we got things done.

This drove some employees to leave despite enjoying other aspects of the job.",3,Former Employee,OGP Associate ,"Commerce, TX",4/16/23,2023,4,16
Complicated ,"The job was very easy, but the managers make the job hard and complicated! Some of the customers can be rude, and some can be very nice at times. Walmart management is poor! ",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,Louisiana,4/16/23,2023,4,16
"Not a bad job, but difficult and demanding","The job itself is simple and pretty straightforward, but simple does NOT mean it's easy, as it's a very physically demanding job. You're walking for hours on end, and it requires a bit of arm strength, especially if you're pushing lots of carts at once. Breaks also tend to be incredibly inconsistent, and I usually take my breaks based off of how busy it currently is, sometimes not having any at all (except lunch breaks). Management can also have some outrageous demands, when I physically am incapable of doing what they want me to, especially since at the time of writing this review, I'm only a month in and already completely left alone on some days. Even when they drag associates out to help me, it can be a real challenge. But aside from demands from management being a bit much, and breaks being inconsistent (and sometimes totally absent), it's not a bad job at all. It's just the conditions that I genuinely have complaints about. If we weren't so heavily understaffed, my complaints would be very few and minor.",3,Current Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Mesa, AZ",4/16/23,2023,4,16
They will over work you,"So for starters the management is trash they don't give you any pay holidays but still say it's mandatory to be at work otherwise you'll get 2 points. Walmart policy's is all about protecting them not the employees. You gotta wait 6 months to get benefits witch is unheard of. They expect you to go above and beyond with no preference pay or bonus, the only bonus you'll get it about 30 cents after one year if working for them. You're not allowed to talk to anyone because apparently you only gotta focus on your job and they will yell at you for that.",2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Phoenix, AZ",4/16/23,2023,4,16

I loved everyone here,"I absolutely loved my job working at Walmart. I was an overnight stocker. Management were understanding and helpful people.  They understood hardships in life. I had gone through 2 family deaths and through pto, and loa, I was able to take time off and give my last respects.I loved everything about the job. It was fast paced and fun. I loved stocking,I had been there 6 years when I went for a random checkup to my doctor who told me I had high blood pressure, and wrote a letter to my employer that I shouldn’t carry more than 20 pounds. There went my job as a stocker. Walmart management worked out a daytime apparel position for me, but it was less money. I gladly took the position but I found it wasn’t paying all my bills. I decided to look for another job for more pay.I hated leaving Walmart. If I was able to transfer my previous pay and raises I had earned in 6 years to my daytime job, I would never have left. I feel overlooked. 6 years of my employment meant nothing to them. I’m hurt. Perhaps in the future, Walmart should exempt loyal associates from their “daytime pay” rule. I’m saddened and miss my Walmart family, but when my pay was lowered, I’m afraid paying my bills took precedence. ",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Pineville, MO",4/16/23,2023,4,16

Beats working in food,"Your experience working for Walmart will vary widely depending on the manager on duty during your shift. There is a fair bit of training for the core parts of working at Walmart, but as a floor associate, you learn about 95% of your job on the fly. I feel that could use improvement (though, in fairness, I did leave Walmart in 2019). On occasion, you will be asked unreasonable things. At that point, you have to make a judgement call as to whether you can say “per policy, I cannot accommodate this” or just involve management.Also, no, medical breaks are not a thing.",3,Former Employee,Wireless Sales Associate ,"Council Bluffs, IA",4/16/23,2023,4,16

Management is very unprofessional and expect to get yelled at by customers daily,"management has always been unprofessional at Walmart. Most of the job duties for the team lead fell on top of the regular associates in the bakery and upper management has failed multiple times to fix this issue. most of the time other associates get away with not completing most of their job duties and requirements before leaving, but if you are the night person working in the bakery expect for their job to become yours on top of all of the other responsibilities you have every night. Work is unevenly distributed and favoritism is played very strategically at this location. Don’t forget the customers who try to teach you how to do your job on a daily basis. Most of the time they’ll try to get something for free and argue with you.

It’s good job if you don’t mind being micromanaged ,"The job itself is not hard and actually has some decent benefits. what makes people quit most of the time is management. They micromanage, play favorites and treat you like a kid in kindergarten. If you go in and don’t make too many friends then you might be able to avoid the drama that goes on. Most of the team leads are super nice but also very stressed out because the coaches are rude and don’t know how to professionally talk to people or how to give people a break when they obviously need it. You also used to be able to have a set schedule with the same days off each week which could be  one weekend day and one weekday but now they’ve changed it to a 4week rotation where you get one weekend off a month and you work all the others and you may even end up working 10 days in a row if your coach doesn’t care about you.

Poor management ,They don’t notice the workers that go above and beyond. They allow too many employees to slack off and wear whatever they want. They are always understaffed and never seem to treat the customers with any respect. Yet they expect the hourly employees to be polite. They never keep enough registers open and so customers get angry at associates thinking we are all trained to be cashiers! Not every associate can unlock merchandise and again the customers don’t know this so they give us a poor rating. No room for advancement yet pay differential for graveyard shift only. Managers walk around with their chests out and treat hourly employees like slaves. It’s a job. It pays but this is my honest opinion. If you apply here. Get ready to work hard and not be noticed. ,3,Current Employee,Front End Associate ,"Lacey, WA",4/8/23,2023,4,8

Is okay. ,"Working at Walmart can be a mixed experience. On one hand, the company offers competitive pay, benefits, and opportunities for career advancement. Additionally, the company provides training and development programs to help employees gain new skills and knowledge.

We unpack the truck and try to organize it into departments. Since we were so short staffed we as night shift never touch produce or deli. Around 10:15 we would have a team meeting and get assigned areas. Most times I was put either I the freezer section, infants, cereal or general merchandise (ie pharmacy, shampoo, beauty etc.) Cereal was the easiest and hardest because we weren't allowed to take an excess back to the back. It had to be put on the top shelves for top stock even if we had months of back stock up there. We did what we could stocking shelves until 4:30 a.m am then we would typically zone the store. Clean isles, front and face things etc. 5:15 we would deal with back stock which would have to be scanned, tagged and shelved in under 30 minutes.

Scheduling too stiff for me but good pay!,"Keep in mind that I did overnight and its likely its a different experience compared to day workers, but the scheduling system is the same. There is a 5 point system, which is where I kind of screwed up. I had to take mental health days as overnight was a bit much for me but I wanted to see it through. Unfortunately when I got violently sick with a stomach virus and I was on my last point so I had to quit. The points fall off but only after months and its one by one. The management was very chill and extremely kind and supportive to me which I appreciated so much. I really don't like the two week in advance notice if I need to call out for whatever reason. Also I was considered part-time despite working a full-time schedule which meant I didn't get full-time benefits which I found a bit unfair, but I think that was due to being a temporary remodel position. The dress-code is very chill too and you get two 15 minute breaks and one hour lunch which is a great system. Overall I can say my experience is positive!

Walmart  pharmacy is still much much better than CVS or Walgreens. independent pharmacies will always be much better than the other options. ,3,Current Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,"Houston, TX",4/4/23,2023,4,4

Pretty straight forward on what your had to do! ,Delivered different Walmart stores and Sam's clubs everyday you never know what the next schedule holds. loads are divvied out as needed. Most stressful part for me was standing out in the pouring rain/freezing cold trying to get a response to be let into the back of the store to be offloaded. I waited 5.5 hours one night and had to have the rest of my load rescued so it could finish being delivered on time. Very frustrating to say the least‼️ but over all it was a grate company to work for and I would go back if life permitted it. After 15 months I had to leave for family medical reasons. I was mostly happy at Walmart Lord knows I earned that job ‼️ and it was very worth it in the end. The bad to me was being gone all week. But that is truck driving! Even tho you come home for the reset it goes by instantly. So there's no home life to speak of. I found I really didn't make that much more money then anyone else on other jobs. As you have to pay for lawn care and everything else they goes wrong when normally I'd fix it myself‼️. While on the Rd wife called and said the pipe behind the washer was leaking. So I had to call a plumber out. Was charged $468 for a 5¢ piece and took him three minutes to fix and leave. I guess you truck and stay away from home for the passion not because you'll get rich doing it.,5,Former Employee,Driver  ,Mebane d.c 9855,4/4/23,2023,4,4

Team leads and other associates were very helpful, but the management was not the best at times. They mainly cared about money instead of associate wellbeing.

It’s like they don’t even want to actually manage people.None of the managers can even look you in the eye because they’re afraid of your honesty and mindset.Very toxic workplace.No overtime but you’ll still be struggling and they’ll say you are fully staffed. However, once they fire you they’ll get a whole bunch of people to help get things done that you couldn’t finish because no help was given.People who started a week ago get paid the same as someone who has been working there for a long time.I do not recommend working in any fresh department as there is over the top drama and unrealistic expectations.",1,Former Employee,Meat and Produce Team Associate ,"Plymouth, NH",4/4/23,2023,4,4

Considering the workload that was placed upon the people left over I don't feel like we were fairly compensated. Walmart Inc. hates paying you for overtime.

It's just 'meh',"I've worked in the OPD (online pickup & delivery) department since being hired almost three years ago. I have been denied promotion twice (the first being to another department. The second, my own department). In both cases they chose someone from another department, or another store all together. We aren't given the proper equipment to do our job (ie, handhelds and printers). We aren't given proper training, but are expected to do our jobs correctly. I usually find out how to do something after I've been repremanded for doing it wrong. But it's hard to get fired from Wal-Mart. You can come to work high, and that's fine. But you'll get written up for wearing ear buds or a hoodie while working on the floor. Managers play favorites, and will promote their friends instead of a more qualified applicant.  On a positive note: The associates are all so unhappy that we've formed a sad kind of family bond with one another. They don't drug test, but then again, this allows for some questionable hires.

Profit is king,"When I worked here for 5 years and then another 6 months a couple years later, I found out that this company does not care about presentation, or the customer. This job will work you to the bone and it's only goal is to make sales and bring in profit for itself. Management will try to force you into an unflexible schedule, try to guilt you into overtime, throw away your bonuses and write you up for being sick, or in my case, going to my grandmother's funeral. The management will practically forget that you exist until something is not done. They rarely go hands on either, electing to order you around instead of doing a simple task right in front of them before disappearing to hang out with half a dozen other managers in the back office, regardless of the manpower or time your team has. They will also ignore the fact that almost every piece of equipment is broken, including carts, jacks, dock plates, dock lights, handheld computers, even faulty exposed wiring hanging from the cieling. When I was an unloader, management seemed to forget that we existed, until the end of the shift when things weren't done within a strict time frame. You would be expected to force freight onto the shelves when there wasn't room and the write you up for assisting customers instead of working product.The training was minimal too, definitely a figure it out yourself type of attitude.

I've seen so many people come and go during my time here.

It helps with the bills.,"As an unhappy Walmart employee, working at this retail giant has been a frustrating experience. The pay is barely enough to cover living expenses, and the workload is overwhelming with understaffed departments. Management is disorganized and unsupportive, often leaving employees to fend for themselves when it comes to dealing with difficult customers. The company culture promotes efficiency over employee wellbeing, resulting in a lack of job satisfaction and high turnover rates. Additionally, the lack of opportunity for growth and advancement makes it difficult to see a future at Walmart. Overall, working at Walmart has been a disappointing and demotivating experience",2,Former Employee,Grocery Clerk ,District of Columbia,3/26/23,2023,3,26

It's not the best work environment but it pays the bills,"It's not what you know, it's who you know if you're trying to move up or move around. Some days are ok but most days are spent counting the time to leave and go home. If you have a good manager then you'll have a better experience, otherwise having a bad manager will make the experience dreadful, regardless of the job position. It's not the worse place to have a job but they will pretty much hire anyone who's willing to work. Customers are pretty cool for the most part but you will get a karen or ken from time to time, especially if you work in returns or money services. What makes it worthwhile is some of people you'll come across from different walks of life. I've made a few good friends working there. It's kind of like high school in a way. Just don't go around telling anyone your personal business, unless you want the whole store to know. Some people who work there only thrive on gossip. Trust me, your business spreads around the store like a wildfire, so don't fool around with anyone there for example and stay lowkey.

easy job if everything works,it’s an easy job to do if everything works and weather isn’t even that much of a problem since they provide ponchos and let you go inside in the heat. if you get your work done there’s nothing stopping you from just sitting down and taking way more than the 2 15 minute breaks they give you. if the machine is broken and you have to push carts by hand thats the only way the job is frustrating or difficult. the environment is very inclusive with everyone getting their work done and following the break thing with just standing around which shouldn’t be a problem to an employee because everyone has their work done and are always actively available to help customers or do their job when needed.,4,Current Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Springdale, AR",3/25/23,2023,3,25

I only ever work at Walmart for short periods. ,"Pay is okay depending on your role. Management tends to be sub-par. You’ll end up doing other peoples work. They don’t take doctors notes so if you’re sick and you call off, it’s a point. Call off on a key event day, it’s 2. Unless you use ppto but it takes forever to accrue any actual time. In your first year, you’ll accrue about 2 hours every 2 weeks if you work full time so it takes 2 months to get a full 8 hours to cover a shift. Points don’t come off for 6 months. After you get access to your pto, you can use that if you get sick but you’ll still get a point. It’s a relatively easy job but at the end of the day, the turnover rate is so high because the attendance policy is so strict. You’re usually expected to finish your work in an unrealistic amount of time and if your manager is as bad as mine was, you’ll leave feeling like you failed no matter how hard you tried. Certain people will get special treatment as with any other workplace. Overall, it’s never been a crazy horrible experience but I’ve never left and not felt burnt out. Raises are hard to come by so don’t expect your starting wage to go up for a long time. I know people who have worked there for a 10+ years and they only make $1 more than my starting wage. They do however fully pay for ged/college courses for both full time and part time employees. Apply at your own risk. ",2,Former Employee,Store Associate ,"Chambersburg, PA",3/25/23,2023,3,25
It’s honestly not worth it,"They hound you until all your work is done, you don’t get thank you for your hard work, you don’t get sent help when you need it, they definitely pick and choose favorites and not so favorites, they give you time limits which are completely unfair because in that time limit they give you they don’t include your breaks, your lunch, they expect you to have it all done right then and there and if it’s not fast enough you’re getting written up. Being short handed is a huge problem, management could be a lot more friendlier and understanding but they're not, they make it impossible to want to go back to work.

Hard Work but can be rewarding if you put in the work.,"Retail is hard work, from unruly and disrespectful customers to management who either have too much on their plate to be able to manage effectively or are worthless and push everything onto their employees, there is a big element of luck in finding effective teams. However, with the right amount of flexibility to different styles of work and enough dedication to not just up and quit when things get hard, you can find yourself moving up in the company and that is where you can start to effectively change it.

"Easy enough job, it's everything else that needs massive improvement that won't come bc no one really cares, high turn over for a reason","It's Walmart, don't expect much. Easy enough job... When the equipment works. Team leads & coach's are too busy to check in with team members, until you do something wrong & have to be spoken to because you weren't aware you doing something wrong for months. They have you train with someone that has maybe a week more experience than you do, hired at the same time, but started before you. When you alert managers of problems on the job (co-workers not doing their job, which adds to you not being able to do yours quickly & efficiently because you have to do theirs) nothing actually changes. Their attendance policy changed, they do not tell you what your ""points"" are, so if you go over the mere 6 your given in a 6 month span, even for part timers with no sick time, you will be fired, so check them OFTEN W a lead & make sure they are correct or get fixed immediately. Don't think staying late or coming in early will help you when cuts come, and they will, because it won't help. Being a team player doesn't matter either, although they'll say it does.

Not very productive or fair in my opinion ,"I worked for Walmart for 16½ years. It was definitely better in the beginning and it progressively got worse.  Went from having good customer service and plenty of people working the floor to bad customer service and barely anyone working the floor any given shift. Instead of hiring people, they would give extra work to the workers who were already stretched thin. They took away positions including the one I had as a Modular Team Member and turned around and brought it right back only to give it to someone else.

Decent pay but find a better place elsewhere if you can.,"Overview:When I first started working with this company two years ago, I thought that it wasn't as terrible as people said it was; however, those people became more correct as time went on as the store environment got worse overtime. I'll be sharing my perspectives in the following categories below:Management:Management tends to be very strict and doesn't seem to care about their associates. For example, Walmart has something called team scheduling which gives full-time associates a set schedule with the same work days and shifts and the same two days off every week and if an associate refuses or can't work the shifts assigned to them, then they're dropped down to part-time with the leftover shifts in their department. It has happened to me when I refused to work the 10a-7p shift they wanted me to work and when I asked my former people lead about not having hours for the entire week and all he pretty much said was ""open your availability"", making it feel like he was trying to force me to work that shift, which I couldn't do due to school. Not to mention that management tends to have favoritism towards certain associates and their rules only apply whenever they feel like it and towards certain associates.Plus some managers like to make up lies and their own rules in an attempt to scare associates such as telling them that they're not allowed to use Unpaid Time Off even though they can.Associates:Many associates and former associates were pretty nice for the most part. There were some who were rude, but I hardly paid attention to those ones. Similar to how high school - more...",2,Current Employee,Associate ,"Oklahoma City, OK",3/23/23,2023,3,23

They pay well and that's about it. ,"Wal-Mart talks about caring for their associates and their families, however this is not reflective in their work practices. Constant requests for you to work overtime, heavy favoritism from management towards specific associates, and (in my experience) higher management will spread false rumors about you behind your back to make you look bad if they don't like you. Another mention towards the double standards towards associates. Overall, Wal-mart does offer good benefits with the GUILD education program and others, but the cons outweigh the pros by far of working here.

"Good pay and benefits, bad work environment ","The pay that is given is good for a single person or student so I was appreciative of that as a college student. Benefits were also good and provide good service. However, the sense of belonging here and the management has been unbearable here. There is a loss of communication through management and at the same time, they really do not have any form of peer recognition. You could do 9/10 tasks perfect but they’ll pinpoint the one incomplete  tasks and not acknowledge the perfect ones. There’s no accountability in management and they are not found of younger associates giving tips and ideas. A tad discriminating towards age.

Poor Management ,Management didn’t care for the team as much as they cared for themselves. No good role models. Not enough praise to associates that deserve it. Very money hungry company. At least at my location,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Overnight Stocker ,"Lebanon, TN",3/21/23,2023,3,21

It's okay busy body work.,"The work is generally easy if you learn fast and adapt well. It's a physically demanding job and requires you to move at a decent pace in order to get everything done. The managers*can* be understanding as long as you're open, and honest with them. Other associates can be difficult to work with but there's always going to be people you don't like wherever you go. It's just a matter of if you're willing to overlook other people's attitudes and work ethic. if you like busy body work and keeping busy to keep your mind of stuff, then this is an alright job. Daytime management likes to blame all the stores shortcomings on overnight shift, even though daytime associates have very little sense of urgency to try and actually get anything finished. I'm not willing to work days at Walmart. And if Walmart ever opens up to 24hrs again, I will not apply. I only sort of enjoy it cause we don't have to deal with customers",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Airway Heights, WA",3/21/23,2023,3,21
Horrible place to work,Walmart is hands down the worst of the worst when it comes to how they treat their employees. They do not recognize hard work nor do they reward it.

Loved my job,I really loved my overnight stocking position at Walmart but as you may or may not know Walmart has a pretty strict attendance policy.

Great introduction into retail pharmacy,"Walmart is the LEAST stressful of the retail pharmacy options. Still an absolutely stressful, disorganized, sinkhole of despair.

It's awful and managment doesn't care,"Walmart doesn't care about it's employees. Limited sick time, vacation time, and low pay makes it difficult to have motivation to work. Most locations are understaffed, overworked, with not enough proper equipment to get our jobs done.

It pays the bills,"When I started working at Walmart a little over 4 years ago managers had reasonable expectations of the associates, but over the last few year they have removed incentivized bonuses and continue to pressure associates into doing twice the work while being disrespectful and demeaning towards them leading to mass walkouts of up to 30 associates over just a few weeks. on top of the aforementioned problems they rarely approve days off even when you apply to be off 5 to 6 months in advance claiming that they don't have coverage on those days which is why in almost 4 and a half years I've only had 3 approved days off and no vacations.

Bad ,The lack of management made the job so much harder than it had to be. The people that were supposed to stage stock to be put on the shelves didn't do their job the way it was supposed to be done therefore it made the stockers job that much harder. Most times you would spend what seemed like half of your shift sorting out what was supposed to have been sorted for you.

Management directly over me are caring but is also strict, which is a good thing. The rest of the management at the store typically is fruastrating to work with. I do not like the work culture surrounding my team, because the majority of the team that I work with consists of high school teenagers who would rather stand around and talk rather than actually work. Probably the hardest part about this job is working with the teenagers, because they do not care if the work gets done so trying to pickup the pace to cover for them is fraustrating. One part of the job that I personally do requires me to be alone, this is my most enjoyable part of the job because it allows me to get my work done without any distractions, especially from the teenagers.

"Expect to be short staffed, but expected to produce the same output as a full crew","Walmart has consistently cut staff members, as well as hours. However, they still expect the same output. In addition, they know that the revolving door of poor workers, is a lost cause. So, they heavily lean on their good workers. They do not acknowledge productive workers in any way positive. Instead, they rely on us to do more work, because they cannot rely on the other workers, that will soon leave the company, due to the strict attendance policy. The attendance policy is to fire a person, if they miss 5 days, within 6 months. You can apply for a leave of absence. But, all three of my employees that filed for LOA, due to sickness or injury, were denied. They all presented medical documentation of their illness, but each of them were told to submit more medical documentation. They will staff you with poor workers, and then blame you, as a team lead, when these employees cannot perform up to par. For example, my staff consists of one man over 60, one man who is autistic and slow moving, one man in his late 40's who is also a student and constantly exhausted at work. This is for a job that is physically laborious.",2,Current Employee,Maintenance Team Lead ,"Corinth, TX",3/20/23,2023,3,20

They expect your life and career to be walmart. there are no paid holidays. they expect yoh to use your protected time for everything but it doesn’t accumulate like it should if you’re PART TIME ! The work isn’t equivalent to the pay. This establishment has chnaged its policies to reflect its desire for excessive and passive income for them and they can’t even keep employees in the store that actually enjoy working there.

Walmart isn't for everyone ,"I worked at Walmart for seven years. When I first started there, it wasn't bad. But once our store got this manager that's when my store specifically started to fall apart. First of all the attendance policy was pretty ridiculous. That was like a ring around your neck to make sure you worked for days and days like a mule. The policy was basically a scare tactic that Walmart tried to use on associates. I could go on and on. Management chooses who they want to be nice or rude to. Loyal employees also get treated poorly. Walmart needs to improve and respect their associates way better than they have been.

The store needs a lot of repairs and cleaning...There is favoritism also.... I just thought my experience with Walmart was going to be like having a work family..... That's definitely not the case. I don't even feel as if I belong... No support from upper management... Even when I had personal problems that interrupted some of my work days.... Seems no one genuinely cares ... I work hard but was never encouraged or at least told I did a good job.... Not much encouragement but much criticism....

Draining,I worked for 2 Walmarts and both of them treat their workers like hogs. They work you like a dog and make it hard to get any time off. They punish you for being sick even with a doctors note. They take sides and if you have an issue with a team lead they take the team leads side every time. Soul draining job. ,1,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Goddard, KS",3/16/23,2023,3,16
Make money but location can be an issue,"My time there wasn't bad you have a week of boot camp after u pass you go to the DC you was assigned for more training. After that your assigned a mentor and then get a final VOE check to ensure you have driven the minimum they require (I wish they would do this BEFORE you get there) the work is good and once you get the hang of things you can earn good money. Routes or lanes are not difficult. Benefits are good but I don't rely on them so double check to make sure. Now the Cons for me I had to drive 2hours to report to work and 2 hours to get home. I wish I could've got the closer DC to my home and I couldn't keep doing that drive. The 2nd was the slip seating I feel they could give all the drivers their own but they have a reason to why. And lastly and this might have changed but I would've liked a local position. Some DC's are in the process and some already have availability. Again double check to see if that has changed. Overall they are one of if not the best mega  / large scale companies out. They really appreciate the drivers, the pay is good, the equipment is top notch, if I could. I'd go back",5,Former Employee,CDL Class A Driver OTR ,"Palestine, TX",3/16/23,2023,3,16
"If you care about your mental wellbeing, DO NOT work here.","Working at the Walmart in Crossville was okay for the first couple weeks, until I transferred up to front-end work. I have ended up doing more, if not all of the work. They keep employees that sit around and slack, and when I go and tell them about it, they only brush it off and say ""Just do your part.""

Walmart is okay ,We had 1hr lunches which is wonderful and had some of the best coworkers I’ve ever had and management was pretty rude due to the fact that we barley have enough time to do it our pallets and the pressure was on big time when they came around they would talk and let us know how much time til the next 3 pallets would be coming out vacation is unpaid unless you are full time and had been there a while ,3,Former Employee,STOCKER ,"Norton, VA",3/16/23,2023,3,16

Hit or miss,"It’s easy work, but I would only apply to this specific Walmart if I wanted to feel like I was in high school with a bunch of middle aged women. Upper management is unprofessional and does not try to disguise their favoritism. Coaches are generally unhelpful and will backstab their own employees in order to satisfy other members of management. Team leads are hit or miss, some work and are involved in their departments, sometimes they’re the only people keeping it together; others only check in on their department when they’re about to leave after following coaches around all day. The place is also overran with rats (check out the pickle aisle) and management refuses to do anything other than put a few traps in the backroom. OGP was my first job ever, and it was honestly something I really loved to do. The previous location I worked at was completely different and actually a pretty positive experience, so not every Walmart has these issues, but this location is not great and I do not see that changing unless there’s a change in management.

I’ve avoided coming to work for Walmart most of my working life and personally knew a lot of employees at different walmarts and in different states and I believed it but I witnessed it and became a victim in the 11 months I’ve been here. STAY AWAY FROM WALMART. There’s so much to type but not enough room so fair warning especially if you like to stand up for yourself when you’re being mistreated they hate that.

"Good job, depends what role you get","As an online personal shopper the job was pretty easy. Pick the orders, place them in your carts totes, stage totes, take out orders on arrival. Cleaning of course, sweep the ogp room, wipe all the totes/carts, replace cart bags, etc. Then organizing the room as you clean. Filling in all spots with a dolly,  stringing totes on carts, basically just put things where they go. Hardest part is probably running around the store. Picks drop 3 hours before scheduled pickup. Meaning hundreds will drop, if you’re in a bigger city probably closer to 1,000 every hour. Also the room tends to get cramped with all the people who have carts putting stuff away and other people getting orders ready to take out. Management was pretty good. The most enjoyable part is your breaks. 1. 4hr shift =15 min break. 2. 6hr shift = 30 min unpaid lunch 2-15min breaks. 3. 8hr shift = 1hr unpaid lunch, 2-15min breaks.

Don’t Drink the Coolaid,"Walmart is a very appealing place to work until you actually work there.

Also they are proud that they turn out employees quickly? “We can get a new you here, trained, and working in three days time.” While being a big donator to the Make A Wish foundation, this employer does not care if a mother has to call off to take her child with Cancer to the hospital.

Inclusive Work Environment,"Where people of all cultures meet and work as a team. If there's one thing I can say about Walmart, its the diversity is second to none. Sure there are cliques, but as opposed to high school, most here get along. Management has great relationships with hourly employees, but once you are salary, you are all but owned by the company, as no regard to maximum hours per day/week are given.

It is one of your options of somewhere to work when you're just starting out. That's it.,"This may not be true for all Walmart locations, but the one I worked at was terrible. Decisions from corporate always punished those at the front of the store and made our jobs worse, and when they weren't doing that, their decisions were just outright confusing. I had also heard from several other employees about how they've been mistreated by their team leads, though I never had it happen to me personally. As a cart associate in particular, I always felt on edge because of the possibility that I could damage someone's car or be hit by some jerk trying to leave the store too quickly.To highlight their incompetence, the reason why I left is because I had gotten injured at work. It took them 2 HOURS to file an incident report and have me talk to  a nurse over the phone. The nurse ended up telling me that I was on my own anyway and that I had to self-treat. I could have been at my doctor's office within 5 minutes instead of going through all of this.Honestly, there are many other options for you out there, but if you really need a job and some money, Walmart is an option, I guess.

Good for a paycheck and not much else,"I've worked for Walmart for three years at three different stores and in two different job positions. While each store has their own management and business practices, their core flaws are always the same. Individuals who work hard and are reliable employees are always given the work of others. Lazy, unreliable and generally bad employees are kept around much longer than nessasary. Meanwhile, decent employees are given extra work, little to no thanks, and often punished when they can no longer do the work of more than one person. Walmart typically relies on punishment for mistakes made and doesn't reward or recognize those who truly hold the place together. They no longer give double time or even 1.5x pay for working blackout days (aka holidays and holiday weekends) but will absolutely still give out double occurances if you call out. It's not all bad though. You are allowed and typically encouraged to take hour long lunches and you get an employee discount card. Since they don't ever seem to get around to firing employees with a bad work performance, the employees who are hardworking and basically untouchable. Plus, they need everyone they can get since the turnover rate is extremely high. If you want to get experience in a bit of everything, Walmart is pretty good for cross training different departments as well as training for management positions.

Depends on the day and how u handle things,"There is a lot to be said for this place. For the most part i really enjoyed it there. I met so many really great people. The job itself can be very demanding depending on what department u work in and the time of year or even day of the week. I like a good challenge. So for me i didnt consider the job its self hard but there are people there that make it hard to do your job. Unfortunately there  are people who are in lead rolls that dont care about the people they are over and when u do your job well instead of being happy and supportive of your job well done they see it as competition and sadly will do things to sabotage ones who are doing well and will do anything to try to either make u look bad to the bigger bosses or drive u to a point of wanting to quit. Its not like that with the whole place just certain departments with certain ones that feel no one is good enough and will gladly take credit for someone elses hard work yet blame that someone when they them selfs fall short. There are people there that manage to just kinda float through the day somewhat doing their job but mostly bare minimum and then other workers have to really pick up the slack. I suppose most jobs have issues like that but its sad when its the team leads lacking and slacking and the ones under them are constantly doing so much more than the position its self requires,or is actually allowed.

Their policy is you have a lead to answer and get directions from however associates and other managers will want you to do things without going through proper channels. As maintenance there were several days we’re you was the only maintenance personnel for the day. You would be required to do the work of two even three people. Some of the associates and managers were nice but overall the managers are the worst to deal with. I will never go back to this place as they can be very disrespectful and discriminatory ,2,Former Employee,Maintenance Technician ,"Kerrville, TX",3/7/23,2023,3,7
"Fun workplace but terrible policies, & favoritism","clock in, then Head to your department to be told where to work, you get a break, work, then lunch, then work, then break, then work, & leave. You have to have a thick skin or have no emotions as you will be cursed out by customers. Management brushes aside problems that you report saying “I will look into that.” You make friends with associates & some customers. You can’t advance in the company if management dislikes you.

Being a hard worker only gets you more work.,"Job was easy, stocking merchandise on shelves, zoning and cleaning up work area (carts, boxes, plastic,etc.) Management loved my work ethic so much they thought I needed more work.

If you were in the right store it’s like a little family and everyone just wants everybody else to have the best, it’s like a little family. None of the work is exhausting or hard most of it. It’s just either repetitive or boring but it’s easy work and as long as you are nice, everyone else will be nice to you. It’s a great work environment and I can’t wait to go back.

"Hang tuff, buttercup!","Hard work physically & mentally, but somewhat fun once you know what you’re doing. Very poor communication from managers & especially team leads & their associates. This leads to much confusion, chaos, & an especially stressful first 90 days for new employees. Most don’t make it past the 90 day mark before quitting. It’s hard to keep coming in day after day in such an oppressive environment. Supervisors are mostly to blame, as most speak to you like you’re a dog. Makes it hard to stay positive & breaks even the most positive person down after awhile. BUT, pay is decent for a small town & there are a few really great people who work here. My advice is, find those people if you want to survive. Also, take notes & document any issues you’re having bc throwing people under the bus is common practice here.

Decent job,Good place to work when fully staffed. Otherwise it can be a headache working an area by yourself for months on end. A Good night almost entirely depends on your how your management approaches who goes where for how long.,3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Cameron, MO",3/5/23,2023,3,5

The only place I've ever felt like they hated me for working,"Working lot for Walmart was physically draining, and you're looked down on for doing your job.

"It was a very poor experience overall, and sometimes embarrassing. I hope to never fall back on it as a reemployment option ","What is the best part of working at the company?I think the best part about working for Walmart was certain individual coworkers and the benefits.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The lack of care for the employees and a certain level of dishonest practices within the company and from some of the managers.I think the biggest part of Walmart that's caused stressfulness is the lack of communication. there was basically little to none.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?I worked at two stores, so I saw different types of culture. At the first store, there is a total absence of teamwork and camaraderie. I sensed a ""every man for himself"" approach throughout the whole company. At the second store the atmosphere was slightly better but it's still was somewhat similar to my experience  as the first one.Employees felt very tossed aside, overworked and severely underpaid. Overall, the work culture was not a good experience.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Same thing day in and day out. Come in, do my job, clock out and repeat. I had to become Street Smart when it came to approaching certain managers for certain things. I grew to be able to know who to trust for advice or concerns and who to stay away from.It got to the point where it felt demeaning to work for walmart. I felt like I outgrew the company and needed to move on to something better. I felt embarrassed working for walmart.",2,Former Employee,Salesfloor Associate ,I was in four different departments in a span of 4 years.,3/5/23,2023,3,5
A Decent Place to Work. Wouldn’t stay though,I worked as a 2nd shift stocker part time 2-11 shifts. Walmart is not rainbows and sunshine. It can be stressful like any other job. They are fair with hours and pay for the job. It’s a decent place to work part time but for full time I would look elsewhere.,3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"London, KY",3/5/23,2023,3,5
Decent place to work but very boring ,"I’ve worked at walmart for around 4 months and it has proved to be incredibly boring and has pretty much gotten worse over time, it can be laid back and mediocrely fun at times but most of the time it’s incredibly boring and you get in trouble for things you weren’t even told about",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Springfield, MO",3/5/23,2023,3,5
The people you work with are amazing people. Many will go out of their way to help if you need it,"There isn't really anything hard about the job I had (stock). Many of the issues came from management. Managers should strive to be leaders, but most showed little concern for those struggling, and falling behind in their assignment. The other associates I worked with were friendly and helpful. ",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Spring Hill, FL",3/5/23,2023,3,5

Great benefits decent pay,They pay for you to go to school. It is one of the main reasons I chose to work for this company. They also have decent benefits and give people PTO and Protected PTO. Great maternity benefits and the company constantly tries to build and create a better future.,5,Current Employee,Associate ,"Dawsonville, GA",3/5/23,2023,3,5
Fulfilling but they cut hours & pay,"I absolutely loved working in the pharmacy. I was over half way there to be certified as a tech, (they told me they would cut my pay if I didn’t finish by a certain date & then after the halfway mark, never gave me time to actually do the computer work so they would inevitably be cutting my pay) I also told them my childcare hours and availability which was fine for the first month and then they switched up and told me if I couldn’t work 2 hours later & on weekends then they would cut me to part time as well, so I quit. I don’t recommend working here, unless you’re single with no children, as the more experienced techs lives/families will matter more than yours, hands down.

The pharmacy has been a good place to work and is more fulfilling than working the rest of the store.,"Walmart has been a steady, reliable job for me for many years.

Wouldn't recommend if you aren't big on reading as training or a quick learner,"To be frank, to work for a company like Walmart, it would be best if you already have a decent amount of experience with retail. Its a very fast paced environment, and things are constantly moving and changing. I've learned a lot working there, but not without being reprimanded first. Training is rarely physically taught, it's all done digitally, and if you don't understand certain aspects, don't really expect anyone, especially management to give you a clear and concise answer. On good days I would at most get a vague description/opinion from my team lead or coach. And if you're going for a cashier/frontend position, don't expect much warning about pricing changes or help with learning certain aspects of the register unless someone else is nice enough to tell you. Most people who work for Walmart tend to be arrogant and at times, extremely selfish. If you're lucky you might find a handful of people who are decent enough to be helpful and kind to you. Also, if you ever feel like advancing your position, good luck. They require a lot of specific things before you can even be considered to change departments at the associate level, so you can imagine how that goes with higher positions. Other than that, the only good things to mention are the benefits. They offer 401k, access to stocks and medical/dental insurance.

Walmart,Well I don't like this company. But the actual job itself as a cashier and my regular customers I thoroughly enjoyed. If Walmart had paid me what I deserved would have made a huge difference. Plus management does not care about you you are not a person to them,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"El Campo, TX",3/4/23,2023,3,4
not very stressful job but everyday is the same ,Overall the people working at Walmart are good people but the job gets repetitive. Everyday it’s the same routine of unloading the truck filled with merchandise and putting them into pallets. After the truck is finished it’s usually lunch time and after lunch we start to stock the food. After everything is done we start to “zone” where we make the store look nice by pushing items forward on the shelves.,3,Current Employee,Stock Associate ,"Tempe, AZ",3/4/23,2023,3,4
Stressful and understaffed ,"It is not the worst place to work, but definitely not the best. It is stressful due to the unrealistic expectations they give you.

"Stressful Work Environment, High Expectations, Intense","I previously worked at Walmart.com in San Bruno, CA. It was an intense work environment. People were generally nice and friendly, but it was very competitive. The leadership team worked us like crazy. People worked all day and night. Expectations were extremely high (seemed unreasonable). People were laid off, fired, etc. for what seemed like no reason. It was not a work environment that was healthy. It really damaged my mental health and permanently altered my overall outlook in terms of where I want to go in my career and the type of company that I want to work for (ie. trying to avoid a company like this one).",3,Former Employee,Anonymous ,"San Bruno, CA",3/4/23,2023,3,4
"Like High School, but your livelihood is on the line.","From my 6 years of experience working at Wal-Mart, the only takeaway is that Wal-Mart is the largest worst place you can work at. Everyone gossips. If you're a bad worker but befriend management, you'll definitely get promoted into a position you have no ability at working. A SA perpetrator got promoted to salary positions while upper management knew there was pending litigation. Another manager actively stalked an associate during work that she had to step down from her position for a lower position. I was asked to clock back in from lunch 10 minutes into my break on a weekly basis. When I decided to pursue my education, I was given two different answers from the same manager about whether they would accommodate my schedule for my school schedule. I was literally scheduled for the first 2 years on days I had put ""Unavailable"" in the system. I left because they were unable to follow through with an agreed upon work schedule.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Painted Post, NY",3/4/23,2023,3,4

What is a typical day like for you at the company?Hit the floor running and you don't stop until the end of your shift. Stressful and at times unreachable tasks are given.

Soul sucking.,"Typical day at work is chaos. The company expects you to do the work of multiple people and for you to constantly work over or come in early, but will NOT tolerate any over-time. Management breathing down your neck about some SOP, and add more to your job description without additional pay. No work/home life balance. Lots of drama. Any concerns or complaints are swept under the rug, and if you've worked there for years, you can guarantee the newest addition to your team is making the same amount or more than you after putting your time in. If you've been there for a while, your best bet is to quit, wait 90 days, then apply again so that your experience is worth something. After working for the company for over 10 years and giving a months notice for my resignation, I wasn't even given an exit interview. Management is completely incompetent and if your new, you can count on getting thrown into the job. The turnover rate is absolutely unreal as well as their attendance policy, which is frequently abused. Quarterly bonuses are no longer a thing for the average employee, but higher management gets fat bonuses, which is why they are always on your butt about doing more, more, MORE.

Job is straight forward ,I have two managers one is all about moving faster and will ask you to do something just to stop you mid way to do something els then questions why you didn’t finish the first thing they said. He really won’t  question about firing someone that’s the vibe. The other is a lot more chill and honestly I don’t mind working the days I’m scheduled with them. Overall really depends on which manager you have. Work in general is very straight forward with 2 15min breaks and 1 hour break which sounds good but then you think about why be there for 10 hours when your basically just getting paid for 8? Pay is 18.50/hr for all overnight employees. You are allowed to used your headphones to listen to music. One of the biggest drawback to this job is that it requires you to used your own personal cell phone the whole shift and it’ll kill your battery and phone!! Shifts are from 10pm-7am for all overnight employees. No store discounts and pay is bi-weekly. They are understaffed some days and depending on the manager will make you run circles around the store from what I’ve heard do to me only working 3 days a week. Oh one thing to note is the whole call out policy! Basically it’s very easy to get fired if your not ontop of it you need to call two different numbers and if you miss one or forget it’s basically two strikes and your fired! They basically don’t mind firing people because there will always be someone els to replace them. Some people get way more work than others almost like a whole favoritism thing! ,3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Northborough, MA",3/2/23,2023,3,2

"Just me and the carts, essentially ","I was a cart pusher. Not much to learn, easy work. I didn't work there long because it was a temp job prior to getting surgery.However, as someone who worked in the summer heat of Arizona in a physically demanding position, I strongly believe that the cart pushers should have hazard pay during the summer. Yes, they provide a tank of water for the cart pushers and always encouraged us to step inside to cool off for a few minutes when needed, but it was still absolutely dreadful. I had never drank so much water in my life and yet still felt like I could collapse at any minute. The job seems so easy but the more you are pushing these hot steel carts across long stretches of asphalt in 110°+ heat, the more you regret what you signed up for.Cart pushers also have the benefit in.. as long as there are carts to grab and everything looks clean out there, you can kind of slack a bit and chat with the others. It was a friendly and supportive crew of people out there. On the downside... management also seems to forget that you guys exist and is incredibly slow to provide help out there when there's only one or two people on shift and it's a busy day. During monsoons, they say they'll provide a poncho to protect from the rain but it takes near an hour after it starts pouring for them to get them out there and by then, you're already soaked.If you're looking for a summer job in a state like Arizona, I'd strongly recommend looking for a position INSIDE the store.

Terrible Company to Work for,This was overall the worst job I have ever worked for and I worked for Walmart for a year. You are treated like an inferior from the moment you walk into the door. You get no benefits. No holiday pay and if you call out on a holiday you get double pointed. Also you have no choice but to work on a holiday. Even if you request off they will always deny. Part time employees do not accrue PTO. You can only have 5 absences till you are fired. They do not take doctors notes so if you are sick you are SOL. Walmart was a disease spreader. If someone got covid everyone got covid because they were forced to come in. Do not work here if you have the chance. Save your sanity. Also I was going to college for a better future and the management belittled me when I asked for part time instead of full time. They do not want you to succeed they would rather you work at Walmart forever. A lot of my coworkers that have worked there for 20+ years are making the same as a new employee. You are not valued here. You are simply a tool to them. ,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Edmond, OK",3/1/23,2023,3,1

It's a shame that dedicated people like that, that have families and bills to pay and responsibilities to account for, are stuck at an employer such as Walmart. Who has the least respect for the people who work for them and / or their families. They are the hardest working, loyal, employees yet are seen as replaceable anytime Walmart feels the need to replace. And that's sad. If Corporate Walmart only knew which ones are struggling to work their rear ends off so that they have a job to support their family, but others are the ones stealing, goofing off, destroying products, and half way doing any job they are given because they simply don't care about any of it, are the future Store managers, or Corporate workers with all the bonuses, pay raises and benefit packages.When I left Walmart and it was my last day working there, after I was clocked out, I actually had a hard time leaving because I felt as though I was - more...",2,Former Employee,Garden Center Associate ,"Owensboro, KY",3/1/23,2023,3,1

Nowhere To Go Except Insane,"Wasn't able to hold anyone responsible for bad or unsafe work with the store manager overriding every HR decision we made so nobody respected middle management. Ended up having to do most work myself and work long into the night with terrible work-life balance. Worked for the company for 8 years prior, but management was a whole other beast. Very clique, very cutthroat amongst other managers trying to stand out for a promotion. No teammwork to speak of at that level unless your definition of team player is being the one getting taken advantage of just so you dont make waves while almost everyone else screwed around, lied, and threw eachother under the bus to look good to the store manager. Good news was a lot of them got fired after I quit. The whole experience led me to almost unalive myself due to stress. I'm not some whiny, lazy kid, but even MY psyche broke under the terrible conditions they had for management. Took an out at a job making almost 40% less, and it still was the best decision I have ever made. Leaving that terrible position ended up making me an even BETTER employee at a other company when I finally realized how unproductive I had become just because of burnout and stress trying to keep up with the impossible demands of managing a sinking ship of horrible work culture and their joke of a grasp of safety and ethics.",2,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,Florida,2/26/23,2023,2,26

Not good ,"From my experience working at Walmart at least in this location, you are not cared about. They don’t care about sick leave, and will fire you if you hit 5 points no matter if it were important or not. The coaches do not care about you and you’re personal life, you pretty much have to devote your life to them. You get more out of your job being full time, but it is hard to become full time as they do not like to give just anyone that position. You will be expected to go above and beyond and anything less than that is simply unacceptable. Getting days off is hard, and a lot of their policies make no sense. There is also no communication between management, I will be told one thing by the store manager; and the next day being yelled at by another manager for doing said thing. They have a strict dress code, and treat those with piercings/ colored hair ect. Different.

"Walmart is a ""means to an end""","Never take the job too seriously. Walmart will exist rather you are there on a particular day or if the unrealistic target times are met or not.Management has clear and obvious favorites. The point system indicates 5 absence days leads to termination, which is low for retail anyway, but there are a few workers that are gone more than they are at work, and continue to have their jobs. Those are the same people that do little to no work, piggybacking on the work of others.Some of the tasks assigned are not your actual work, but management wants you to do their work, and rarely believe you did the task, constantly questioning you. Ps, those tasks do not change how the job and company works.It's tedious work, and generally you don't find an end. Each shift is pitted against each other. There is no sense of ""team.""Take the job for what it is...a paycheck.You are demanded to work all holidays, but you get NO holiday pay.The pay is good, among the best in the city.Benefits are expensive and don't cover much.If you need a paycheck, go for Walmart, but don't take it seriously.

Poor management and corporate policies. ,They force each employee to work multiple jobs by being deliberately understaffed. This causes an even higher turnover rate. Don’t expect any kind of benefits for two years if you’re hired on as “part time.” You’re actually hired on as a temp so they can push benefits back even farther.

Inexperienced Management,The biggest issue is management is promoted not based on how well they prove themselves but by how much the store manager likes them. Their friends get promoted while more deserving people aren't given a chance. This leads to inefficiency as half the Team Leads and Coaches have no idea how half the store even runs.

Worst job experience,"I was treated horribly and ignored by most of the people there. Management had favorites they'd let get away with everything and weren't good at their jobs. The 5 point system is ridiculous. This is the only place I worked at that did that for attendance and it made things difficult especially when I lost my job for the points when I had valid reasons for missing work, but the management's favorites would hit 5 points but suddenly their points would be lowered and they wouldn't be fired. It was a very unfair work environment. I did my job to the best of my ability and never got any kind of recognition when I was doing well. There wasn't anything enjoyable about the job besides the pay. Maybe I just happened to go to one of the worst locations, but from what I've seen on Reddit, it's pretty common.

Walmart overall is a good place to work at  the work is fairly easy overall it's the attendance policy I hate. They give employees protected PTO and regular PTO and employees get terminated if they reach 5 or 6 points. You get a half of point when you are late and can't use Protected PTO and a full point if you miss a shift and do not have enough accumulated Protected PTO to cover 8 hours in for missed shift.

I definitely was not given the supervision that I felt a new worker should receive instead I was just thrown in and expected to learn on my own then yelled at for not working fast enough.The whole environment was extremely dysfunctional with the people in charge doing a poor job of enforcing their own rules, and disrespectfully scolding the temporary associates for doing something but not saying a word when one of the full time employees did the exact same thing.

Laid back,"Nice supervisors but at times too lenient in letting bad employees goof off and not do equal amount of work as co workers. Also,  instead of disciplining employees who intentionally flout rules all employees lose perks or privileges like being allowed to use one ear bud to listen to music (leaving one ear clear to hear when mgmt calls you over PA or on the floor) while stocking overnight. They tend to lean on hard working employees to compensate the ones that they know work hard at not working.

Depressing overworked,I would say that Walmart was a company that said to give you 40 hours a week mandatory for scheduling if you have other events scheduled for that week you really have to work those in Walmart won't let you just get those days. Walmart's point system is very important to know about and know a backwards and forwards because if you get up to six points you are terminated or you have to wait 6 months to reapply or in a certain specialty cases you have to call ethics and plead with the ethics board of Walmart in order to get your job back which is crazy to me because Walmart does not even follow their own policy when it comes to terminations.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tallahassee, FL",2/17/23,2023,2,17

"Long hours, little support, obnoxious managerial staff, and generally poor working conditions","I spent the worst years of my life working for these guys. Expectations of staying past shift to finish work only to cut hours later in the week so that they don't have to pay you overtime. The worst workers see promotion, the best workers are trapped in the menial labor positions until they are too burnt out and exhausted to continue working for the company. The pay and benefits are okay for retail, but still nowhere near living wage, and the company will often deliberately work you just under the number of hours that are necessary to get your benefits to activate in order to keep prices low.In general, avoid working for walmart at all costs.

It’s a good start for a first job ,"Walmart was the first company I worked for back in 2020. I loved the hiring process because they asked important, but not intimidating questions and they gave me a chance as a 16 year old with a limited schedule. It’s a great work environment if you like or at least don’t mind people.  I love helping others and many people who shop and work at Walmart are just like me  so I felt very comfortable there. It can be daunting at times because you’re always going to have unfavorable customers and even unfavorable colleagues but i feels that as a first job, it is perfect for someone just starting out. You get that first hand experience of dealing with people that is unique to only Walmart. I only left because of management, and the uncaring attitude of all of the higher ups. I was penalized for missing work due to bereavement although I provided everything they asked and did as I was told. It was ridiculous as I could have used some proper guiding but it seemed that most of the superiors didn’t  want to be there, no one wanted to train, help, or do their actual job really. I felt like a bit of a nuisance at my location so if you’ve got crippling anxiety, then this probably isn’t the job for you. However, I do also believe that it depends on the specific Walmart you apply to. I worked at one in Tampa, Fl and It was great apart from everything I mentioned there. I have been to worse and better locations so I say that it’s a gamble. Either way, I recommend working here if you’re a minor or a young adult just trying to rattle in some change.

Not Bad but not amazing ,"All in all it's not a bad job or terrible pay for what I do as an OPD employee. The main problem is that your hours can be inconsistent and often get cut because other associates take to much overtime (e.g taking 30 minute shorter lunches, or staying late when not supposed to). Although it is not directly Walmart's fault that they are stealing time, it results in 8 hours shifts becoming 4 hour once. Additional many of the people who steal this time and cause the time cutes receive no repercussions for their actions and are often protected from being fired by the Team Leads in charge of my section.

Morale is very low,"Working for this company can be very challenging. The attendance policy is based on a point system. They don't consider health issues as a reason for an absence. Unless you have accumulated pto hours, there is no paid sick time. Bonuses aren't given anymore for associates. Only a yearly bonus for upper management. It's very hard to get management to stick to their job obligations. There is a lot of favoritism and retaliation that goes on in the workplace. You have to basically cater to upper management's ego to get ahead in the company. It use to be a very enjoyable place for employment, but the morale on a day to day is very low due to the lack of respect from the upper management team.

Supervisors and leads not so much, there are a few(2) that make the job amazing and worthwhile. The others will make make you hate it some nights. They don’t care if your shift ends at 7 and you completed all your tasks by 4 or 5, if they wanted you to be done by 2 you will hear about it. If you continue to get done with your assigned stocking aisle before shift end but not by their “time standards” you will then have a “productivity meeting” which will consist of them telling you that you need to pick it up or it’ll turn into a disciplinary action even though you’re finishing way before your shift ends. Their logic is if you have 6-7 pallets to break down and stock they want you done in 2 hours….2! Meanwhile they do not account time for breaking down cardboard ,making sure product is in the right spot ,emptying your cardboard bin when it’s full etc. They don’t care. Also pallet jacks are limited so if you don’t find one then you’re spending your first hour with a shopping cart offloading minimal product rather than having the whole pallet in your designated aisle which slows you down. Also if you’re not back inside the building from break whenever the lead decides to lock the door then you are locked out until the lead sees you so no telling when that may be. For a little more clarity let’s say you’re a smoker. If break is at 12am and you’ve been working so hard that by the time you look at the time it’s 12:05.

Welcome to Walmart,"I needed a quick way to help me earn money and get out of the house during the chaos of 2020 and was able to acquire a job working as an overnight stocker.Stocking was fun work for me- someone who likes independent work, and organizing things. However the management had a lot of communication issues. The other coworkers weren’t as motivated and I feel  we didn’t work as a cohesive unit. I passed out due to my eating disorder and was chastised for not being fast enough. Subsequently I couldn’t make it to work, I did attempt to alert my coworkers and was let go.It wasn’t a ‘great’ job and you’re not even a cog. Though I did earn more money I’d ever wanted anywhere else.If you can’t work you’re replaced easily.If you need money and are willing to show up and DO YOUR JOB or at least make a good show of it, this is what you’re looking for.If you are motivated to ask for what you need from management as well as completing your training, you will receive the benefits- and there are many available for motivated workers.It is a company that cares for its motivated and able employees.Use your voice or you will be lost.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Overnight Stocker ,"Layton, UT",2/13/23,2023,2,13

"Unproductive, ineffecient and incompassionate","Work life during any shift at Walmart is fine when your store is being managed by competent people. This one isn't. Finding any reason to stay has become extremely hard and getting any kind of flexibility is impossible unless you're a store favorite. Company will not work with you. Coworkers are being denied leave of absence when a relative passes. You will be reprimanded for any little mistake for certain managers, even if you are doing the right thing. Rules and company policy is up to each manager's discretion and nothing is really set in stone until they want it to be for that instance.

"No training, no care for employees. ","I was hired on for an overnight shift to work on a project remodeling the store. There was absolutely no training whatsoever. They force you to sit at a computer for hours expecting you to read hours and hours worth of information and immediately put you to work once you've completeled the lessons. Leads were impossible to find when you needed them to answer questions, and again there were a lot of questions due to no training and emphasis on NO training. No time off is granted prior to hire meaning you have to earn it second by second which ties to their incredibly strict attendance policy. Within a 6 month period you can miss a max of 4 days before getting fired on the spot. Time off is slowly earned and even slower if you're a temp for the company.If you're hired on as a stocker, they have high expectations when completing your work within a time frame and you'll be punished if you couldn't finish it fast enough and they don't give a lot of time.

There is 0 support from management at the store level, you are blamed for everything and corporate wants one thing, market wants another thing, store manager wants another thing. It’s a joke. However, you will learn a lot that you wouldn’t learn in any other position in the store. I wish it was remote or at least half remote. The expectations of what is required to get done on top of dealing with the associates in the store all day… it’s too much. There’s a reason this job used to be two people.

I would highly recommend working for Walmart. However, there are some bad things about the company as well. Apparel TA's receive the same pay as Cashiers. In Apparel your job is much harder than simply running a register and performing other easy tasks, you must lift heavy boxes of clothes and similar Apparel accessories. The pay for the labor that Apparel requires is not worth it. Another downside to Walmart is that when you are sick and miss a shift, you gain 1 occurrence, and at six you lose your job. The occurrence rolls over after six months, or you must use your PPTO to take it off.

Very fast work but enjoyable ,"Work was busy and had to be fast and efficient, knowledgeable, pleasant   I enjoyed the time spent at Walmart.  I enjoyed the challenge  everyday.

Terrible company ,"Nothing to say because it doesn't matter. They are the reason there's walmart shootings because of the management just like at that store. Law enforcement needs to be involved with the 1399 store.

This company doesn't care ,Worked for this company for almost 2 years the management is not your friend they barely help when you ask or need them there is no hr just someone who tells you to call corporate when you go to her about anything the leads micromanage you hide and watch you make you feel miserable I loved my job for a while then it became mentally exhausting all the things the lead and coach would do and say to you becomes too much the pay is good i will say that and that's the only reason I think certain people tough it out but it wasn't about the work load which is heavy and they want you to do your work and then do others load as well so many people have came an went since I was there I don't think they ever cared they just need bodies to do the work and I couldn't take it anymore maybe if I wad on another shift I could have loved it again but it's like they say people don't quit jobs they quit management ,1,Former Employee, Stocker ,"Pounding Mill, VA",2/11/23,2023,2,11

Managment and job security,Working at walmart you are only aloud 4 points before you are fired. They do not accept doctors notes and if you need to leave early most managemnt is rude about it. You barely build up pto and if you want to use it you have to know way ahead of time. They say they are family friendly but i lost my job because my daughter was in Nationwide childrens hospital sick and i stayed by her side. I put in leave for it and it got denied. They expect you to send in there whole medical chart and then some for leave to be approved. And the management picks favorites and when there is drama they do nothing to try to stop it.,4,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Coshocton, OH",2/11/23,2023,2,11

Absolutely the worst place to work,"You are not a valued asset. You are just an asset. They look at you like a number and that’s all you are. You can and will be fired for any reason. Management has 100% power in all situations. There is no incentive to do anything. You don’t even get a raise off of performance. Raises are based on attendance only. Literally all about politics from the ground up. Do NOT work here unless you don’t care about yourself, your life or your job.",1,Former Employee,Retail Management ,"Kansas City, MO",2/11/23,2023,2,11
nothing,Not a good place to work. They over work you and the pay is not good at all. Walmart is the worst job I have ever had. I wouldn't advise no one to work there. It drains you.,1,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Lancaster, TX",2/11/23,2023,2,11

Sometimes enjoyable but mostly stressful,"When the store was not busy, the work was very laid back and it was easy to accomplish the tasks that were assigned. However, whenever the store got even remotely busy, the front end was practically abandoned by the other departments and we were swarmed by extremely long lines, stressed cashiers, and angry customers. Cashiers were also constantly pulled to help other departments and the managers refused to allow them to return during busy times.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Clemson, SC",2/10/23,2023,2,10
Cool place,"Working at Walmart can be a mixed experience, as with any retail job. On the one hand, the company offers a wide range of employment opportunities, from entry-level positions to management roles, and provides a stable, well-established work environment. Walmart is also known for offering competitive benefits packages, including health insurance, retirement plans, and employee discounts.On the other hand, working in retail can be demanding, with long hours and physically strenuous tasks, such as stocking shelves and cleaning. Additionally, the fast-paced environment and high customer volume can lead to a stressful work atmosphere.Ultimately, the experience of working at Walmart will depend on the individual store and the management team. Some employees enjoy their time there and appreciate the opportunities for growth, while others find it to be a challenging and unsatisfying job.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Ohlman, IL",2/10/23,2023,2,10

Terrible,"Inconsistent rules, managers who didn't care, nothing was done about me being inappropriately touched multiple times for instance.

Constantly loud, with possibly disrespectful customers.",3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,15757 Coit Rd.,2/10/23,2023,2,10
Unproductive,Totally unprofessional it's like they drop you in a shark tank you have no idea where items go and you just have to figure it out so you get yelled at for taking such a long time you're rushed through everything and constantly yelled at for not hurrying and clearing the pallets off the floor when there are only four pallet jacks for the entire store to use it's ridiculous they make it impossible to get your job done and then yell at you for not getting it done,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"DeLand, FL",2/10/23,2023,2,10
Terrible,Revolving door of work for both employees and managers. Managers truly could not care less and the only competent assistant manager was fired for no reason. No good training for specific tasks and they ask you to perform those tasks anyway,1,Former Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Sarasota, FL",2/10/23,2023,2,10
Causes severe stress and anxiety ,"It’s reall hard to move up in the company when there are not many positions any more.. Management takes care of who they choose and not who deserves , pay raises are 22 to 25 cents a year depending on who they choose to take care of! The minimum raise use to be 40 to 50 cents a year plus bonuses but they eliminated that and the bonuses!! I’ve worked for the company 24 years, 15 consecutive and don’t make $14…. Please don’t let the tv commercials and smiles  fool you… I’ve thrown the towel in!!!!!! The don’t hire full time any more meaning no insurance and no real benefits..

(NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK ANYMORE)",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Customer Service ,"Biloxi, MS",2/10/23,2023,2,10
Unprofessional Workplace Environment ,The management team over at Walmart is very unprofessional and no accountability for actions that reflect your work. The ability to move up is based off of lower level thinking and and mind games with employees. Also the people you work with can be good don’t get me wrong but overall trying build a better position is based of non work ethics. ,1,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Coweta, OK",2/10/23,2023,2,10

Stay away toxic work environment ,Management very disrespectful very toxic work environment. If you are over 40 years old and can't work as fast as a young person. They will overwhelmed all older employees to the point you want to quit.

No work life balance ,Constantly being scheduled extra shifts and never able to leave at end of shift. Especially during holidays and inventory time. By end of year feels like your earned PTO is equal to the extra time you have worked through out the year. Never enough hourly associates and falls on you to complete the work. As a salaried manager you don't earn overtime. Bonus is good but only if you meet the meet company goals.,3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Baltimore, MD",2/9/23,2023,2,9

Straight up not gonna have a good time ,Management is dreadful they only care about their bonuses not customer interaction or even their employees for that matter.

Tough but fair,This role at Walmart demands a lot of time but is made up for by the fair pay and bonus structure. You have a lot of processes to complete on a daily basis but good time management can help you through them. Because coaches work in a team setting workplace politics can really decide whether you enjoy your job or not.,3,Current Employee,Coach ,"Huntsville, AL",2/9/23,2023,2,9
You are appreciated and compensated appropriately for your work,Walmart compensates their health care workers graciously. I felt valued for my experience in my opinion as a health care provider. I had to have a lot of zoom meetings. I had to work independently with the store leaders such as pharmacy and HR and education departments.,5,Former Employee,Lead Nurse Practitioner ,South Carolina,2/9/23,2023,2,9
Discipline must start from management ,Management do not care for employees except those in their click. There is a lot of politics ; must people are not held accountable for their behaviors and people who get fired for lying on other employees  are called back to work because they have a friend in management. ,2,Former Employee,Cash Office Associate ,"Landover Hills, MD",2/9/23,2023,2,9
Cashiers are often overworked.,"While the cashier leads are wonderful, upper management often leaves us to drown.

Pays on the lower side but otherwise laid back job,If you work second shift you’ll most likely be unloading a truck and putting boxes on the corresponding pallets. Trucks to tend to range from anywhere between 1500 to 3500 items per. Sometimes you might get two trucks in one day but it rare. Other than that you zone or do shopbacks. ,3,Current Employee,Stock Associate ,"Vadnais Heights, MN",2/9/23,2023,2,9

Good company to work.,"Worked in the warehouse for nearly 6 months before I got covid and then a surgery. Will definitely go back if I could. Night shifts were smooth and quiet. It is very easy to learn your duties, using their technology is also easy and making your daily percentage. ",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Bethlehem, PA",2/9/23,2023,2,9
Overworked,Basically every cashier at Walmart feels that they are over worked. We are always short staffed now so the cashiers who are there have to work harder. Overtime is frowned on and avoided. Maybe if the cashiers got equal pay as other department they’d be more likely to want to work.,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Homestead, FL",2/9/23,2023,2,9
"Good pay, but strenuous work and bad managers.","The pay is good, but they work you to the bone and the managers have favoritism and only care about personal percentage.                              ",3,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Tomah, WI",2/9/23,2023,2,9

Management doesn't care about you.,"If you happen to get sick and absolutely cannot work, even if you have a doctor's note, you'll get fired. If you don't have the protected PTO to cover it, they do not care. Management picks and chooses who to apply their rules to and changes their rules every other day. Good pay, but honestly not worth it. ",3,Former Employee,CAP 1 Team Associate ,"Denver, NC",2/9/23,2023,2,9

"Horrible place, staff and some customers ",Low pay and will make you constantly work positions above your own pay range under the umbrella of “fill in” so they don’t have to give you the raise for the promotion. Staff in the high up positions are lazy and do not care about there employees at all! They ordered Olive Garden everyday and spent hours just chilling and eating expensive meals daily while talking negatively and making fun of some lower level employees!

Overall great place to work. ,"At the deli my job was super easy and was a lot of repetition. I was relied on for more than what I was paid but it never bothered me because it kept me busy and was never over the top. Besides we were already the top paying department. Sometimes we would get rude customers and I was usually the one who had to deescalate it because I “handled it best” but it was rare.  Great Management, they would teach me stuff and try to help me move up to a manager. Many supportive coworkers. Would recommend to to literally anyone.

Started off fun and exciting… didn’t end that way,"When I first started working there everything was good, the team felt like a family in OGP. Then the regional market managers stepped in and started changing things little by little that only hindered us. We hardly were respected. Had other store managers coming in “making sure we were doing our jobs” while we were absolutely slammed with orders and instead of helping out they stood and watched most of the time. Good luck getting a schedule that you need because they don’t care what you need it’s all about what they need you to work.",2,Former Employee,Online Personal Shopper ,"Campbellsville, KY",2/9/23,2023,2,9

High stress environment,"I mostly liked working at Walmart, but you have to be prepared for a very stressful day. As with most retail jobs, there are not enough people to do the work and management has no comprehension of that fact.

Low pay,"$17hr starting pay for personal shopper role does not come close to paying my bills. I was offered a ""promotion"" to meat/produce department after 2 mos. I accepted the role but no pay raise was offered. I find that working in meat cooler and handling cold meat all day negatively impacts my arthritis. I asked to be moved to previous position 4 mos ago and management shows no inclination to get it done! They are obviously more interested in keeping that department staffed than in employee health.

You mean a lot of people cuz there's a lot of turnover but if you get a good group of managers over you that teach you how to do their jobs you get promoted like that and that's how you just keep going and you'll get there you'll get to the top if you want to.

The vendors for the providers at my location were great and my team super competitive so made me work harder. Ended with many awards. Only issue is management team changed so often so didn’t always have support, and work life wasn’t great. Also many people came to me about lack of training.

Even customers will tell you that we are short staffed,"I have worked for the company for nearly 15 years and there are some ups and many downs. The difference on how Walmart wants their stores to run has drastically changed and is only spirally down. Somedays everyone works together, and projects and assignments get done, there really is a sense of purpose. But the majority of the time the whole store is short-staffed, customers complain often about not being helped due to short staff, a massive amount of micromanagement and the standards for everyone are not the same. You can call for help over and over again and only the same people respond while the rest are doing it themselves. Management talks down to associates and arguments over the walkie. The store preaches teamwork, but you get screwed most of the time if you're a decent employee. Productivity is something they complain about often, yet no real training is done and put on the team leads to do they don't even have the time to train since they are pulled all around.  If you are good at your job, they pull you left and right, and you don't get a pay difference even if you spend the majority of your time in a higher-paying area. Only certain people are cross-trained for everything while the majority of the people get away with not doing anything outside their department. Customers know that we are understaffed, but that’s not even the case, it’s them saying that “we are over hours” and then we get cut hours. The pay can be decent if you are in management, but the pay is never great if you are constantly dealing with entitled customers and creeps.

"This company does what it takes to save money, even if the workers suffer from these money making decisions.

Never even needed a drug test (a HUGE plus for any fellow medicinal users out there.) I ended up leaving due to stress and personal reasons, mainly the latter. But beware; corporate is CONSTANTLY raising labor expectations and always scrutinizing every little stat. This can get extremely stressful and bears weight on everybody. And of course, you'll be working on the Walmart salesfloor, so be prepared for the special brand of Walmart customers.

All the employees are miserable ,"I hated working at Walmart. It was not even the work. Even though standing in place while bagging 20,000.00 worths of food everyday is tiring. It wasn’t the deal breaker for me. It was the way I was treated. Not just by customers but by the whole store. In this day in age grocery stores aren’t exactly happy hotspots. The rising food cost affects how customers mingle with you.  Front end customer service gets paid the LEAST at that company. While simultaneously being told that our work was the “most important” which I understand. GREAT customer service gets the public coming back. However when the price you pay the employees to provide the expected service is the LOWEST. . I was a closer at my location and it was horrible. Managers would let the reshop pile sky high all day(knowly) . And expected it completely gone in 1 hour of closing time. while they were tucked comfortably in bed after their shifts. My personal closing team was very understaffed so it gave me a LOT of responsibility which was MY job solely. Certain managers would order team members to finish task not in their position to help their workload. While complaining about work that would be leftover in other departments.  I also noticed weird favoritism in front end. Certain team members would always get the more labor intensive task( bagging, zoning, big reshop carts, Cart pushing )  with very little switches for very long periods of time . While the other coworkers would be practically skipping around ON CLOCK. Less labor intensive jobs (reshop with a smaller cart, self checkout lanes, bull pen).

"Toxic, stressful environment ",It is not what it is made to be. Management doesn’t care about your personal life & they will come at you for everything while they sit in the office on their phones. Older employees will treat the new employees like garbage . You’re required to do other peoples work for no pay differential. Also you might as well never request time off because you’ll never get any of it approved even if it’s 6 months in advance because they’re so short staffed. Also they should pay you for your 30 minute lunch especially if it’s overnight shift because no place is open for you to go to. Overall don’t waste your time even applying you can do much better and work for a place that actually values their employees. ,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,Wisconsin,2/2/23,2023,2,2
Morale swings up and down with management,"I enjoyed the work and the co-workers, however, all it takes to destroy morale is a few overbearing managers with bad management styles. They seem to promote anybody to management these days. You want to make other people's lives difficult for no other reason than your own power trip, great, here is a promotion.This marks the beginning of the ever-increasing workloads due to employee's scattering, running for the hills, and not being replaced because it is cheaper to have you do more work and not replace them. Then add in a general lack of appreciation, that puts the nail in the coffin and forces a seven-year employee, yours truly, to just walk out on a never-ending lunch break.Best mental health decision I've ever made, long live the never-ending lunch break!!!",3,Former Employee,Mod Team Associate ,"Waukesha, WI",2/2/23,2023,2,2

It’s not worth the stress,Have you been to Walmart??? None of the workers are happy. For many reasons. So don’t expect much from this company.

Keep your expectations very low. ,1,Former Employee,Bakery/Deli Production Associate ,"Rancho Cordova, CA",2/2/23,2023,2,2
"Relaxed work environment, quiet, it was a busy day like others but it was a very well worked day","Working in the truck area, sometimes it becomes very difficult, but when you have experience, you work more easily and faster, working in the staqueando areas is normally a little exhausting but it is easy and fast to do, you work as a team, if someone has any difficulty to finish their work, we help them and work as a team, if someone has any problem in being able",5,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Plano, TX",2/2/23,2023,2,2

He was a d1ck with a ""nice guy"" demeanor. Most of management had egos except for 2 of them they were chill.If you decide to work at Walmart I'd recommend produce, meats, Deli, Bakery, Dairy/Freezer. It's chill and strays away from the ""drama"" side of the store. Definitely stay away from becoming a cashier. I kid you not everyone up there treats their job to serious, are to competitive and just feels like Highschool all over again except filled with a bunch of adults.

Other than that I wouldn't say nothing else.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The MOST STRESSFUL part about working there would have to be the customers and some of the managers not doing there job and will the work that they require you to do by yourself such as for example, when a customer come to the register with 2 carts full of groceries, and another employee don't have nobody in there line they expect you to do it by yourself and not get no help but working at winn Dixie it was a whole different situation, see employees had other employees help them in that kind of situation but Walmart do not allow that.

With that being said, management may have also changed a lot since I was there. But, most are willing to work with you in the best way they can.

There was almost never enough equipment to go around so many people wouldnt be able to to their jobs right. The overall feel for the enviroment is that the company didnt care about you and managment only cared if you were friends with them other than that you are on your own and everything is your fault.

Full of favoritism, unfairness, miss use of authority, unethical and unreasonable, manipulation of employees and the system, enforcing rules that are not followed by Thoe's that enforce it ect The list goes on.  Inorder to make this Walmart better at N hw 67 florisant it needs a complete restart in management and honestly needs to go back to haven't department managers instead of team leads and coaches. I completely disapprove of this Walmart location. If I was a member of corporate I would do a complete clean house and start over. If I was manager over there entire store things would be structured.

Always got late breaks and when you gave notice about schedule changes or time off requests they always declined it or would say they “didn’t see your request” until the last minute. Customers are always rude and entitled. Management was lazy and never left their offices unless regional was coming in. All in all, it was a terrible workplace and I do not recommend it.

1 star,What is the best part of working at the company?There is none. What a toxic place to work. The turnover rate is insane. Severely understaffed. They won’t allow you the tools you need to do your job like pucks and printers. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Everything. They don’t allow you the tools to do your job. They give you these second hand virus infected phones that constantly freeze up or reset to scan your items. You spend more time fighting with the phones than scanning. Then there’s the work carts. When you arrive it’s a fight to get an empty one because almost all are still full of last shifts overstock.  The management of this store are incompetent. I’m surprised it’s still open. There’s a reason the shelves are always empty and destroyed and it’s not Covid. The day shift doesn’t face the store before they leave which makes it hard putting things away. A lot of the time they are plugging empty homes with items that don’t go there so you pull it all off the shelf and move it all to the right spot or throw your right item back into overstock. There’s just too much to list but they can’t even keep people there including team leads. Some only last a week and some do their Orientation and never come back. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic. Feel dirty after a night working there. Best way to describe it is Like how a hooker feels after a long night and can’t wait to wash it off.

Comprehensive benifits that falls flat when working for a terrible company with inflexible schedule and poor morale.,"One of the biggest red flags is no matter what position you apply for, you work for WalMart first, it is a way they can rope you into doing labor that is not signed on for.They do not accept any form of sick note from any doctor, they are very inflexible when it comes to scheduling, they have this point system and do not realise that things happen to people. Morale at this company is extraordinarily low and going to work every day is painful within itself, before I even clock in for the day.

A stress filled overstimulating environment ,For the last two and a half years I have been stressed out and over worked. I have no life outside of my job. I'm way to physically and mentally tired for anything after. Most of my requested days off are rejected. You can't take a day off unless you have PTO to cover it. No matter the reason. They even tried to deny me bereavement leave. I'm a breastfeeding mom and they put my supply at risk yesterday also they work on a point system for taking days off you can only miss 5days in a 6month time period or you loose your job. They do have some good benefits. The medical benefits are garbage. No where in town will expect them and you have to pay completely out of pocket to maybe be reimbursed half. Only the vision insurance is worth it. They have life insurance and 401k that are worth it. However I don't know what happens to that money if you are no longer at that job.

Scheduling,Schedule is not flexible you can not pick your hours. If you tell them you can only work a certain schedule they just won't schedule you. If you agree to be open with your hours then they can and will schedule you multiple days in a row because Walmart hours run between Sat. - Sat. So then they could schedule you anytime in between usually only one day off hardly ever 2 off in a row. No overtime they say they pay ot but they will cut yours so you won't get  ot. ,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Wisconsin,1/30/23,2023,1,30

Very hard work. ,I started my overnight stocking job at Wal-Mart a few weeks ago and let me tell you its not for the feint of heart. The pace at which you need to be moving AT ALL TIMES is ridiculous. It will wear you down mentally and physically. Add on top of that big egos and power trips by not only the managers but by your fellow associates and it creates an extremely hostile work environment.

What you want out of a company.,"First, you have to recognize that most retail positions (especially management) tend to tank the work/life balance scales, mainly in the last quarter (the holidays). As a salaried member of management, you can expect to average 60+ hours a week and crank that up during the holidays. You will spend more time with your co-workers than you do with your family, guaranteed. There’s never enough human coverage, there’s always some type of “emergency” that requires you to stay late or forget about your day off. It’s just the biz. Unfortunately, no one will remember those times you stayed 4 hours past your shift to help out or the days off you sacrificed for the “team”. The first time you call off because you take a loved one to the hospital, you will forever be known as unreliable and you can forget about any future development. Because, that “team” that was so warm and thankful when your sacrifice allowed them to go home has instantly turned cold and squeezed you out. If you’re boss wants you out, you’re gone! Senior leadership is somehow immune to their own “open door” policy and even more, people ranked as high as Vice President are unable to think in a reasonable manner when it comes to the treatment of the personnel that allows the company to excel. If you’re comfortable with all of the previous FACTS, keep reading. Walmart is a dynamic company with a large variety of positions and locations possibilities. They’re also one of the largest retailers in the world, so I wouldn’t bet that stores will fade away any time soon. Success takes sacrifice!

Treats employees poorly,"If you have a life especially with kids outside of Walmart don't expect them to care about unexpected things like school closing they will still fire you if you have to miss too many days or will deny you those days off so that you get pointed for it. If you're their favorite you don't have to worry about it and don't really have to do much of anything but stand around in a group with the team leads chit chatting but if you're not a favorite you best get to work. When I worked there they had cashiers repainting the customer service area.  They had one girl always getting on her hands and knees scrubbing the cash registers and floors and she was a cashier.  Just expect to be made to do jobs you weren't hired to do and to deal with favoritism and horrible management if you plan on working there. They were willing to change the schedule for a girl that was newer than me because she had kids but when I asked they got mad and I also have children.

"Great starter job with ok starting pay, but are expected to do more after a while.","Management makes or breaks your experience here. Customers do as well but you will run into terrible customers anywhere. The management I had were nice and understanding. I felt that they tried to work with me when and if they could. Working hard and having a nice attitude will help you move around in the store. Working faster only incentivizes them to give you more work but you will also be talked to for not finishing something fast enough so take it at a decent pace but don't overdo it. You don't want to get hurt here, because the entire process of dealing with a workplace injury is horrible. There are times where the ""culture"" feels very high school-y, though that might be due to the small town nature. (Everyone knows practically everyone).  This also made it easier to make friends of friends I'll admit, but trying to work through the cliques first was difficult.

Overwhelming unfair work distribution,The job has far too many issues with management. You get interrupted for 30 mins to an hour to zone. You get 3 departments to work while others get only one with no explanations. I hate to say it but the managers make it worse. Constantly taking you off your own job to do other things and then penalize you when you cant finish the first job they assigned you in time because you got taken off your first job. The managers say you can request for different departments but this was never given to me despite saying it would be. There's more like telling us to vote strongly agree on all of our assessment surveys of the managers and sitting behind the workers to LOOK at the computers. Its literally vote manipulation. I dont know how thats allowed. I dont want to hate walmart but these things made it difficult to like it. I loved everyone else I worked with but 3 out of the 4 managers were not great. Training was done poorly. Theres so much I didnt know and wasnt told till much later about techniques of how to do things. All I can say is if you join walmart be aware of management.

Should be used as a temporary job unless you know someone to be something there.,My time here was spent with a lot of impossible expectations to which management responded by blaming everyone under them instead of their planning and lack of leadership.

"Easy work for the Pay, Lack of Communication ","I spent over 6 years collectively working for the company. My home store was managed decently. Yet, the constant change of management over shifts and departments led to miscommunication and confusion, putting people in these positions who hardly knew what they were doing or how to handle issues that arose. Overnights was by far the easiest shift because the management didn't micro-manage, but the workload could be overbearing if there were tasks not completed by the day shifts (which was a constant ordeal). All in all, it's easy work for what you get paid with great benefits. Just always expect to have management who don't know what's going on when it comes down to the inner workings, even if they've worked for the company for awhile.

Your experience at Walmart will vary quite a lot depending on your manager and location. ,"My first location at Walmart was much more strict. They heavily enforced the dress code policy and made sure employers took lunch/breaks at their exact times and no longer. They expected you to be working very hard but in my opinion, harder than your pay was worth. At my second location, it was more relaxed, but it came with other issues. They didn't enforce all of the dress code rules only the ones that seem reasonable. They allowed you to wear earbuds while working in the back unlike my first store, which makes sense because we don't deal with other people/customers in the back. They had realistic expectations for work at first when we had enough people, but when people started to quit they expected us to complete the same amount of work with fewer people. Management was a bit disorganized; people in different departments would try and tell you what to do while your supervisor would try and tell you something else.",3,Former Employee,Stocking Associate ,Christiansburg/Lynchburg,1/24/23,2023,1,24

Retail ,"Having worked for nearly a year, I would like to say that there’s no set schedule. I guess you can apply for one after 6 months. The weekly schedule is unpredictable as it constantly changes. There’s a weird point system for when you call out, so when you reach 5 points you are subject to termination. Also, for each point accumulated it takes 6 months to fall of your time sheet. Some of the customers are rude and near violent.

Tidewater drive,Every Walmart is different. If you work at one then move to another you may be in for some big changes. Some management do not follow the given guidelines and rules the company goes by and as a result certain Walmarts may be poorly run with a lot of added stress and problems that could lead to mistakes like being on a reheated for 10 hours with only a 30 minute break. Mostly in a poorly run store the people become very negative and toxic towards one another which makes everyday difficult. But the good news that’s not every Walmart.

Mixed ,"To start with the hourly rate of pay is good. Since after COVID hours are very sparse and hard to get a full paycheck. Most managers I’ve encountered have been great, but there is some bad ones on every shift. There is certain times of the year where it slows down and upper management enforces it’s little petty rules to get people fired (gets rid of a lot of bad eggs but some good people do get caught making small mistakes and get ran out). There is always opportunity to move around once you meet the requirements. So take this however you want it’s mainly based on if you just show up work and don’t cause any problems they usually leave you alone. If you can I do recommend either weekend nights or week nights it’s far more relaxed and not as much politics.",3,Current Employee,RSR Driver ,"Midway, TN",1/17/23,2023,1,17

I think they are trained to lie because the majority of the managers will lie straight to your face without a second thought. Most of the workers hate working there but the pay is too good.

Overall Experience,"Working in digital is a nice job and nice pay but all managers in Digital are not great managers. They cause unnecessary  drama and the team leads are scared of the coach of the department and they do not stand on what is right even when the coach does unfair business practices or pick on associates for no reason. The hardest part of the job was letting people talk to you any kind of way including management. They would talk to you as if you are five years old. In addition, when you ask the team leads something they always give you the runaround or send you to the coach to solve your problems who really do not care for anyone but herself. The coach will tell you she will handle something and never do. She will ignore your calls or texts about something that is important to you. However, if you did something wrong she would handle it right then.

You get nice customers and you get rude customers. I haven’t learned anything working here other than the fact that every grocery store you work for is the same. Management is mostly good. Some of them are lazy and do things wrong but I get treated pretty well. One good thing about working here is the coworkers. They are friendly for the most part and our management sometimes supply us with food especially the holidays which was nice. This job is not hard except for dealing with horrible customers.

Interesting work,"Walmart Asset Protection is a somewhat flexible role depending on which store and ""market"" you work for. There are a lot of policies and procedures that hinder the work and you may be pulled from your role to assist with anything else that may come up (i.e. unload a pallet, stock shelves, etc.). Aside from that the role is what you make of it and there is no set schedule to the day. As a self-starter this was great. Depending on management at each particular store your experience might be fantastic or miserable. Mine was very good and I have no complaints in that area whatsoever. The pay is abysmal but the benefits were decent, especially with the free tuition. In the end, I could not afford to work there anymore as the pay didn't keep up with the bills.

It was a tedious process with multiple customers asking for help which may take up to 20 minutes, all of which I assume the time frames didn't plan for. I learned patience because everyone, including managers from their higher ups, was cranky about the unrealistic work expectations that only got more unrealistic during the holidays when even they worked during breaks.

It’s On ThE wIrE - a Walmart site that is impossible to navigate. Need a good work life balance? Not at Walmart! You sold your soul and your managers to not have to approve your time off requests. Another policy they’ve implemented- instead of giving you a yearly performance review to determine a raise they’ve turned it into a cost of living raise. If you use the points the company gives you to use and you’re above 3 at the time of the end of the fiscal year YOU DONT RECEIVE YOUR COST OF LIVING RAISE.

Good place to learn how retail jobs work!,"I want to start off by saying the regular associates in the store were great, kind and friendly, always willing to help others. The benefits/ pay  are some of the best I have had when working for a retail company. As for work/life balance it is hard when you don’t have a set schedule like I did when I worked nights, when you work days it was all over the place if you have to do stuff with your family especially if you have kids that are active in school sports! When I first started in 2017 things were good, I advanced pretty quickly. I went from an overnight associate to a Support Manger in 2 years. Things were good until I transferred to a store closer to home. The management at this store acted like they were behind you. In 6 months of being in this store they changed their tune. I decided to transfer to days and as a Team lead since, I was told I could not step down to a stocker position even though I told management I was stress out from being an overnight Team lead and I was having health issues. The Team lead position I took was a new AP Team lead position which works in DSD/CLAIMS area. Needless to say, Management knew that the 3 associates in the DSD/Claims area were either going to be retiring soon or quitting due to them putting their 2 weeks notice . 3 days before the associate who was retiring left I started training in the area.  I was left in the department by myself to check in vendors, do claims and get any and all paperwork done in an 8-hour time frame.

The biggest downside is the pay.

But they made me work on a register myself especially when it got busy. I also was never told by HR how to take days off or request days off.

Walmart is what you make of it.,"Reality:  this is not a glamorous job.  The work is thankless and repetitive, and sometimes overwhelming.  Stocking shelves with an expectation of one case per minute, having to pull down the ""topstock"" (all the stuff on the shelves customers can't reach) for the whole store, and overcoming many obstacles to be the front end of a huge supply chain is a LOT to do.  The pay is great for the type of job, with the responsibilities and expectations that go with it.  This is not a stand around and play with your phone job.  This is an off and running from the start marathon every day, but it's strangely not the draining sort.  By the end of a shift I would be exhausted, but feeling great after accomplishing a lot.Success, failure, or just getting by is really up to the individual.  Work hard, communicate well, keep positive, and don't get dragged into workplace politics and you can thrive at this company.  They do heavily believe in giving hard workers a chance to move up, beware though that the expectations are high.

It’s mid,"It’s not too bad of a work environment, it can be a fun, easy job to pass the time, and if you work in unloading you pretty much work as one unit. The negatives about it though is that when the management is put under pressure by higher ups like corporate, they start getting nervous, irrational, and use negative means to motivate you to work harder and faster. Overall as long as you get your work done, and actually work with consistency and at a good pace, managers won’t breathe down your neck.

Starting working 3 yrs ago prior to launch of delivery ,Horrible..    too many drivers using other people account to make money..... Leaving the one's who were there from the start hungry to get orders. It may start out good but after awhile you discover you are left behind struggling to get orders when you have great ratings....... Don't leave a full time job depending on Walmart to always come through making over a 1000.00 a week. That was so long ago in the market area I'm in. Even had to travel out of state in order to pay bills....... Don't be fooled by the hype........ They just want their products delivered by any means necessary...... I'm just saying...... Love at first sight but don't get comfortable....... They just like everybody else....... Business...... and you really don't matter.......

Flexibility and adaptability is a must. Very rigid rules, and consistent micro managing until you are well established and trusted. (High stakes for mistakes) Overall, the job itself is great.

Being good at what you do or even having great customer service means absolutely nothing if you want to move up. I've noticed that if you're a ""yes man"" without a lot of knowledge of how the store runs (newbie), you're more likely to get promoted quickly.  Or if you're friends with management.  Pay for overnights is decent but doesn't always match the workload.  You'll always be doing the job of 2 or more people, you'll get used to it. The floors will hurt your back and feet permanently (get good shoes).My advice is do your job, keep your head down don't do too much or extra because then they expect it all the time and you get the same pay as the newbie slacking in the corner.

Good employees make you want to stay,"Overall a decent job. Retail is retail, and Walmart is king of retail. You will work holidays, except Thanksgiving and Christmas, and you will probably work the days before and after to prepare the site for those holidays. Expectations are high, which inherently isn't a bad thing, but when the expectations include overloading the few associates we have, it can be problematic. Being a manager isn't all bad, but the pay does not reflect the work load. $16 to be over training new hires in frozen, dairy, deli/bakery, and produce, ensure those respective departments are always top notch, and then work like everyone else because you had 3 call outs can get tiring very quickly. There is a point system for termination, call out 5 times without using protective paid time off and you're gone. Except at the WM I work at, you aren't. They just erase your points, therefore rewarding bad behavior. If you're looking to slack off and call out every other day, it's great. If you're a manager and expect to have a team come in to assist your areas, it isn't great. The only thing worth it here is the people. The employees are great and funny, caring and cool. I've made many friends here, and they're the only reason I have remained here for as long as I have. ",3,Current Employee,Fresh Acadamy Trainer ,"Huntsville, AL",1/11/23,2023,1,11

It's all who ya know and who likes you,"Walmart has changed, ask any associate and they (if they've had been there long enough) will tell you that. Not for the good. It's always been about politics, who you know and whether they like you or not, this rule apply if you want to move up within a company. I've seen many people get turned down because they were not liked.  There is no more quarterly bonuses, the only people that get those now are Team Leads and upper management, and believe me trying to get either to actually do their job is impossible, they hide more than they work and get the big money. If you want a job just to come into and then go home, yeah, you can do it.. just don't get caught up in the ""you can go anywhere within the company"" bull or Sam quotes, that's a man that knew about people and treating them like so, sure they still have his pictures and throw quotes out left and right but they don't actually believe them anymore.

Starter Job At Best; morale is dependent on management,"I worked an overnight stocker position with Wal-Mart for around 7 years. Many of those years were fine, a decent job with regular promotions and offers to move up in the company. But the morale and demeanor of all the employees changed based on management. Whether it was a hard-working manager who valued our help (which led to good morale and overall satisfaction in the employment) to a non-chalant, wispy manager (which led to apathy and decreased morale).In my estimation, if you're not planning to move up, move on when you can.

4 stars,"What is the best part of working at the company?As a former salary manager of Walmart building relationships was the best part of the job. Although I had been with the company almost 8 years before my departure, if was like having an extended family. But as the years progress it became more like a duty to work there. The demand and unrealistic expectations were insane especially when Covid 19 entered the world. The lack of compassion (which they preach) was not a thing. There’s no work life balance.

Would Not Recommend,"I worked at Walmart for 2 years and I would not recommend it. Online Pickup is probably the best job in the store because you get to walk and push the cart all over instead of staying in one area, but expectations were too high at this company. People who work hard and follow the rules do not get appreciated enough, but people who do not put in any effort get promoted. We had to go find items in the backroom when most of the time it was packed and so full you could barely squeeze through the valleys when the item was not on the shelf; not just for dry foods either, the coolers and freezers, too. Just recently before I left, the store manager wanted us to start going to the trailers outside if it gave a location there in freezing cold weather. Dress code became absolutely ridiculous; no hoodies, no jackets with full front zippers, but the vests they give you have a full front zipper?! Always kept the store cold even when it’s cold outside. Overall, I only enjoyed my experience there because the job was easy and I made good friends with coworkers. Don’t be fooled, this is a good part time job for anybody in school or maybe just as a side job, but for a full time job, there’s better places out there.

It’s a job ,The job itself wasn’t hard nor bad but I got lied to from the beginning. Was told I would get 40 hours but only got 24 hours. Sometimes I would get called in 2-3 hours before my shift and then I’d get in trouble for coming in. All in all not a bad job and it’s easy to learn how to do just wish they people that worked there were a little nicer.,4,Former Employee,Team Member ,"Hernando, MS",1/9/23,2023,1,9
"Great managers and coworkers, unrealistic expectations ","They have ""times"" that we are supposed 2 be done by. However, when corporate does the time study, they just time how long it takes you to put the item on the shelf. They don't include opening the box the product comes in, breaking down the box, moving pallets, breaks, nothing! A lady had 3 pallets of stuff 2 put up once, the time she was given to put all 3 good size pallets up? 3 MINUTES!!! Walmart has unreasonable expectations and even though some team leads understand those times can't be met, they're made by their superior to say something to us. 1 of our team leads I adore! She worked her way up and is the only 1 that understands those times are impossible! We get 2 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch, breaks are great! The company does make sure we have time to rest. Pay is amazing, store itself is always clean and well cared for, u can pretty much set your own days to work so my only complaint is the unrealistic expectations, which could lead 2 being fired",2,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Belmont, NC",1/9/23,2023,1,9
Happy to be part of Walmart ,It's a great place to work and staff make you feel like you're always part of the team all around.

Great job but very demanding ,"The typical work day is fast-paced and you're constantly busy. If you're not busy, something will be found for you to do. I learned many customer service skills such as telling the customer in terms of their vehicle what services were done and gave them suggestions of what to get fixed on the vehicle. Management is very peculiar on who is in the ""in-crowd"" and who is not. Most higher-up management were friends and if one manager doesn't like you, they all seem to have something against you. The entire environment is cliqued up and if you're welcome in the store all depends on how certain people feel about you. The hardest part of the Job would be the customer service. You always need to have your feelings put to the side when dealing with customers whether they are happy, sad, angry, or just calm. Most of the time, they hear a small change in your voice and assumptions are made. The most enjoyable part of working at this job was gaining the knowledge and skills I didn't have walking in.

"Promising Start, Followed by downward spiral.","Typical days when I was first hired were simple. I would go to work, perform the various tasks and come home. It was suspicious how I was hired for one position and then moved to another during the hiring process, but it was mostly overlookable. Around 6 months into working here, things began to change. Management was never the strongest point, but it consistently got worse. Conflicting orders, constantly increasing duties, and refusal to fix prominent issues in addition to blaming their employees for not trying harder while shirking their own responsibilities. I do not recommend working here. It starts out positive, but quickly can change depending on management. Please don't make the same mistake I did and heed the warnings of other reviews, as its not limited to a specific location it is most likely not middle managements fault, but rather company policies that result in these issues.",2,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Waynesboro, PA",1/8/23,2023,1,8

I got a point for going home at the end of my shift because my child needed dinner and I had the supplys in my locker. Their point system is so bad  to the point that you 5 point every 6 months. They told that I had to reschedule my doctor's because I had to be at work when I can't miss the appointment. Don't even try to have  doctor  appointments while working cause even if you give them knowledge of the appointment a month in advance you are most likely to not get it off.

Ok,It was just regular. If your hourly rate is bad there’s that but other than that enjoy unlocking cases and rolling teevees to cars. Oh and you should also know how to set up a prepaid mobile device. ,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Wyoming,1/5/23,2023,1,5
Management is not the best and there isn’t a flexible schedule ,"I honestly enjoyed my job as a personal shopper. It was pretty easy for the most part but honestly working with the management was difficult because most of them didn’t want to help when we got super busy and behind. Most just walk around doing nothing, but that was mostly from this store. Also the hours are not good and they are not very flexible with schedules even when they say “they have a flexible availability.” You have to have an open availability to even be able to work there or they’ll just cut your hours even more. Also the point system was not good, at least for this store because you only had until 4.5 points to get terminated. which that means basically you can only call that many amount of times unless you had PPTO to cover that, but even then that was still hard to get after working a lot of hours. Being a cashier wasn’t bad until you had no people to help when it got busy and managers disappeared. You also have to wait until someone takes your spot to even go on break or lunch and it would be just at random times, also the same with leaving. I did enjoy the walmart + and the associate discount wish it was a little more though. ",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Online Shopper ,"Mayfield, KY",1/5/23,2023,1,5

Awful,"Do NOT work here. They do not accept doctor notes, requesting time off is really difficult, you’re not allowed to switch shifts, management is absolutely awful including store manager. ",1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Statesboro, GA",1/5/23,2023,1,5
Good pay for the area,"Horrible working conditions. Very limited breaks. Ridiculous pressure to meet production goals. Impossible to work safely and meet the minimum goal so you don’t get fired. They do not take into consideration delays that are out of your control. For instance, if there is a long line to refuel your lift, you do not get credit for that down time, it goes against your production. Late trucks, not enough people to clear inbound freight or replenish pick bins, spills, equipment down. The only way to make production is to literally RUN through your entire shift and pray you don’t get hurt. If you do get hurt, they will harass you into not filing a workers comp case and get medical care. If you do, they require a rep to go INTO your doctor appointment with you! Despite being on your feet for 12 hrs plus, you only get 20 min for lunch and the break room is far away. Need to use the bathroom? Not if you want to make production. Meanwhile, all office staff get an hour for lunch and two paid breaks. ",4,Current Employee,Various from Floor to Manager ,"Pottsville, PA",1/5/23,2023,1,5

Nobody cares about anything,"Do a good job, oh well, do a bad job, oh well.  Too many managers trying to fight over employees.

Not fun,"When I started working at Walmart, everything was good. Ever since I took the management position, they expect me to complete 200 tasks within my shift which I can’t do.

Walmart offers a flexible and challenging work experience.,"It can be a great time and rewarding to work here, however there is a chance to have your shifts removed when requesting time off, if you catch the attention of anyone in a position of power, that's it your pretty well done working there. They will keep an eye on you the entire time afterwards. Some employees are given the chance to transfer to other work positions/teams instead of getting a coaching or reprimand, other employees are immediately called to the office for a coaching and are not given this opportunity. They forget to close the office door when talking about people which is against company policy.Work life balance is non existent since the managers believe everyone should stay for overtime when tasks are incomplete even when they do not have the people hired to complete their daily tasks.Example: one year we were informed our team was supposed to be 32 people to ensure completion everyday.We had 15-24. Sometimes less.",4,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Bartlesville, OK",1/5/23,2023,1,5

Big company with many jobs and departments to work not just the store,"Many people only consider the store side of Wal-Mart, but there are actually many diverse jobs with this company.

Doesn't care about employees,Management constantly changing your schedule after the schedule has been released and not making sure it's okay with you before making the change. The paid tuition program is great,2,Current Employee,Front End Associate ,"Peoria, AZ",1/5/23,2023,1,5
"Success is who you know, not what you can do","The pay for my department was decent and the work is easy. The coworkers are the only thing enjoyable about the job. One member of management will tell you to do one thing, and then another will tell you to do something totally different, and then you get in trouble by the first manager for not getting your assignment done and then you’re thrown under the bus by the second member of management.  Was approached about multiple advancement opportunities and interviewed only to be turned down for someone that has been there less time. It’s all about who you know, not what you can do. The hard workers have to pick up the slack of the lazy ones but still never told good job or that you are appreciated. If you do too good of a job they will keep you from moving anywhere else, including promoting. They will only promote you if you are hateful to your associates. Being nice to others gets you nowhere in this company. Regular associates get poor pay with no bonuses, while upper management get huge bonuses every year. I don’t agree with the values of this company. ",2,Current Employee,Deli/Bakery Associate ,"Centre, AL",1/5/23,2023,1,5

Management,"Your feelings on working at Wakmart fully depend on what kind of manager you have. If you're lucky and get a great manager they will go out of their way to make your work/life easier.

"Decent part-time job to start, can become worse over time.","I worked for about 2 years in the automotive section inside and saw at least 3 employees start and finish their jobs at Walmart just in my area during my time there, which speaks to the turnover rate. Management can be hit or miss and things can be pretty hectic especially around certain dates throughout the year. If working inside, be prepared to work outside of your department and to be familiar with knowing where most things are, even if it's across the store. For the most part, if you are very proactive about letting them know ahead of time, they can work with your schedule but dates that are already scheduled are usually going to stay that way. Clocking in and out through the app is great, I never had to come in a day I wasn't scheduled and was never forced to stay late or come in early although I was asked to multiple times. Overall, if I had more help from management or just more associates working there at all, it would've felt a lot less miserable.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Emporia, KS",1/5/23,2023,1,5

Take the position serious enough to be considered for a promotion,"Everything moves like clockwork at Walmart. Once you know your position and have become efficient in completing your tasks, your day will go smoothly. I've learned that Walmart is always willing to promote individuals who show they take their jobs seriously and complete their tasks with time to spare and is willing to take on more responsibility. For the most part, management can be helpful and supportive, but there are a few that can benefit from taking a class in human kindness. The team members are friendly and willing to answer questions and help with tasks that you may be unfamiliar with. The hardest part of the job is a team member not participating or completing their assignments. The enjoyable experience I had with this company is the team effort to complete tasks in various departments.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Team Lead ,"Merrillville, IN",1/5/23,2023,1,5
