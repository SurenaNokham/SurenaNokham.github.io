"Productive environment , understanding management","Over all working for Walmart was productive, although the management did put a lot of pressure on their harder working staff members and not enough on the workers who needed a little push.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Mustang, OK",3/7/18,2018,3,7
productive job advancements,"great opportunity job advancement,benefits,wonderful place to work._x000D_would definitely recommend.its a family owned & operated business,they care about their staff",5,Former Employee,Department Supervisor ,"Webster, TX",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Adequate job for entry-level employees,"Good pay, flexible hours, management willing to work with school. Ample opportunity  to move up in the company. Good work environment, but can get hectic around big holidays.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Waco, TX",3/7/18,2018,3,7
It was a good atmosphere,It was a good job i loved interacting with customers i just didnt like the hour decrease. I enjoyed learning new things i worked in different areas of the store and learning all the products,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Houston, TX",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Okay place to work if you just need a job,"My experience with Walmart has been varied. I've gone through several positions but never felt like I actually could move up. Then I realized I don't want to. The management is unorganized and disrespectful, and I personally know several managers that stepped down because of it. They would rather take a pay cut and continue working as a regular associate than move up because of the lack of respect between managers, and the high stress and expectations associated with the new title weren't worth the raise. _x000D__x000D_That being said, as a regular associate the job itself isn't bad. The work is the same every day and the pay is pretty good. The only catch is that you need to have the right manager. It took me changing positions three times to finally get a manager that would give me full time an regular hours. If you don't care about career advancement and just need a paycheck every two weeks, you could do worse than Walmart.",2,Current Employee,ELECTRONICS SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Hollywood, FL",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Good store to work for,"My typical day would be to clock in,check in with your supervisor,do your job title,take your breaks.The workplace culture was fine and what I learned working there was how to assist to customers.",5,Former Employee,Cart Attendant/Courtesy Associate ,"Oldsmar, FL",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Worst company ever,"Management walks pass you & never speaks! They look irritated by your presence. The company hires you as a “temp” so they can fire you whenever they want. (They don’t like you, you are DONE) I’ve seen it happen many time. They treat employees unfair, make you work long hours & give you NO BENIFITS WHAT SO EVER",1,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate ,"King of Prussia, PA",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Stressful and in the middle of culture change,Stressful and in the middle of culture change. More management than workers. Deciding whether to be an e-commerce company or a retail company. Can be a good starter position,1,Current Employee,Advanced System Engineer ,"Bentonville, AR",3/7/18,2018,3,7
worst managers ever,"if they don't like there jobs why don't they quit...(managers) treat workers like peasants. because the store was opening they had us build everything, they has sweeping and dusting which was not in our job description",1,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Pico Rivera, CA",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Face paced a lot of communication,A typical day at work would be handling customers with certain aspects...helping customers with anything they need...handling money transactions....the hardest part of the job is trying to make a customer happy that day....the enjoyable part is coming to work and making money of course but it’s really what you make it.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Jacksonville, FL",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Fun workplace,Other co-associates are cooperative and willing to help each other. Management are provided valuable advice and guidance. Proper basic believe and good cultural are fully present at work environment.,4,Current Employee,"Manager, Responsible Sourcing ","Bentonville, AR",3/7/18,2018,3,7

Walmart warehouse,I worked here for the last 12 yrs. And yes at times was stressful and fast passed but it was a good job. I liked all of my managers and human resource clerks.,5,Current Employee,Scanner/Sorter ,"Bentonville, AR",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Enjoyable enviroment,"Walmart is a wonderful place to start off working. It teaches job skills that you can you at any other job. It teaches leadership, customer skills,  basic maintenance skills, and communication.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Pass Christian, MS",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Productive and enjoyable,Enjoyed working at Walmart as a sale associate. Stayed very busy and would go back if they were hiring. I did a variety of things. Stocked merchandise kept the department clean and straight worked with customers mostly what ever they wanted me to. Enjoyed working with my co-workers and miss them now.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"College Station, TX",3/7/18,2018,3,7
It's a job.,"When going out to work, so many people look at every detail of a place and if one thing is wrong, they quit. Walmart is a place of business and it will never be perfect or have perfect people. If you are expecting easy, don't apply. If you are expecting everything to go your way, don't apply. If you have a set schedule but want 40 hours, don't apply. (It's not going to happen.) Bottom line, Walmart is a good place to work. People criticize and judge but you won't find a better starter job (and sometimes a full career) elsewhere especially with them raising their starting wage. Work hard and without complaint or don't work at all.",4,Current Employee,Cap Team 1 Associate ,"Summersville, WV",3/7/18,2018,3,7
its cool,i worked at walmart . i learned how to cashier it was fun being a cashier. i enjoyed scanning the food . it was a seasonal job. i enjoyed the workplace i worked in. the most enjoyable part of the day was break time lol jk .,5,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Hiram, GA",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Customer Service based,Always busy stocking and/or organizing merchandise that is stocked on the sales floor to make it more shop-able.  No two days are exactly alike as you never know what type of customer issues may arise. Work with a variety of people both as your co-workers and the customers you serve.  The hardest thing about working for WalMart is inconsistency of schedule and management doesn't communicate effectively with sales associates.,3,Current Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Longmont, CO 80504",3/7/18,2018,3,7
walmart if fun to work,"I loved working for Walmart. only thing I don't like is not being full time. I have to take second hand insurance and don't get paid vacations. other than that, the customers make the job.",5,Current Employee,Customer service host ,"Meridian, MS",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Walmart isn't the best company to work for but not the worst either,I had a tough time working at walmart personally. They underpaid me and my boss wasn't friendly. The employees are friendly but It's difficult for me to work with supervisors who stress out over the silliest things that could be fixed. I won't return there my time was brief there for a reason. It's a good place to work if you are a stocker or working in the warehouse area. but not as a cashier or customer service.,3,Former Employee,walmart cashier ,"North Port, FL",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Bad break-up,"Almost wish I could go back._x000D__x000D_The lack of 2 stars is mostly because of my experience with HR and workforce management. _x000D__x000D__x000D_It was like HR/WFM don't have a tradtionals roles, or they are confused about their job abilities/responsibilities. When it came down to who could/should do what, I was tossed back and forth for months. Showed up for SCHEDULED appointments with my HR rep, to find that she had left and not told anybody, or even tried to contact me to reschedule. Eventually I just got tired of the run around and had to resign._x000D__x000D_With high turnover and high need, I would think that part time or remote options would be the first offers, rather than ADA. It makes more sense to keep employees and work with them, than to go ADA and both parties lose._x000D__x000D_If they would've given me the remote or part time options, I would still be with Jet today.",3,Former Employee,Member Services ,"Draper, UT",3/7/18,2018,3,7

its a decent for the pay,"the management isn't very helpful in situations when you need them. you ask them for help and they leave you waiting forever and they also don't explain anything to you, your just thrown out to figure everything out alone.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Hobbs, NM",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Assessment Tests,Had to pass assessment tests in order to stay at Walmart. Walmart chooses who they want to stay because of the Assessment test instead of looking at how well they worked.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associates ,"Canyon Country, CA",3/7/18,2018,3,7

It's a really terrible place to work and you'll never see a raise,"Prepair to work like a dog and break your body to make the waltons rich.  You will never get a raise and if you do it will be 10cents, which is really a pay cut because of inflation.  The only raise you'll get is to their expected ""rate"".  This year alone ""rate"" was raised 15%,  and our ""raise"" was less than 1%.  Honestly it is a HORRIBLE place to work.",1,Former Employee,Orderfill ,"Menomonie, WI",3/7/18,2018,3,7
Customer Service Manager,"I started out as a cashier in 2013, and by 2015, I moved up to a Customer Service Manager.

I have learned so much and had the chance to learn new departments and be out of my comfort zone. Most of the managers are really helpful and so easy to talk to them without feeling that you are a bother. the hardest part of the job I would have say is when the customers aren't happy and they become so upset that they don't give you chance to try and help them which can be very frustrating, and them making you feel like you have failed.

Lack of Character,"Wal-Mart hires depending on who you know, not what you know. In order to be favored and/or promoted, you have to be either an attractive woman or have to be buddies with management. They do not treat all employees the same, nor do they follow to policies as written. Policies/rules are made up as they see fit. Management will only help you out and be reasonable if they are friends with you. There are many hard workers there, especially with open availability, that get passed over for people that are not hard workers and have closed availability. The reason is because they befriended management. If you keep your head down and don't care about moving up in the company, this job will be for you. Otherwise, ALWAYS cover yourself and try and befriend management (not employees)",2,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Horizon City, TX",3/5/18,2018,3,5

Horrible company to work for.,Walmart is one of the biggest chain stores to date. They don’t care about their associates. They treat you like trash and expect you to do everyone else’s jobs.  I was let go because my manager didn’t know how to fix schedules and thought Walmart was more important than my classes. It was very unfair. There are plenty of people that work there that do nothing but still have jobs. I would not recommend anyone work there.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Houston, TX",3/5/18,2018,3,5
It was a retail store.,"Working for Walmart was a typical retail store experience. I started in the photo lab, then I moved to claims which involved processing defective, returned, or stolen merchandise in order to save company money. I processed items and prepped them for shipment to the return center so that the store would get credit for them. My job in the claims department directly effected the store's quarterly bonus. After the claims department I moved from the store in Painted Post, NY to the store in Watkins Glen, NY to take on the role of support manager. A role in which I was responsible for managing the GM(General Merchandise) part of the store. That position was the most demanding, but by far the most enjoyable and rewarding.",5,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Watkins Glen, NY",3/5/18,2018,3,5

Whether its a temporary job or career you can get either at Wal-Mart,"Aside from the stigma of working for Wal-Mart at the end of the day its a decent job and you can earn a honest pay from an honest day of work. That being said unless you want to climb the corporate ladder in Wal-Mart I can see how ""job burn out"" would set in reletively fast. Its open 24/7 so theres not a moment that goes by someone isnt in the store whether working or shopping. If you're a new hire then you work the schedule they give you, as you move up you can get a more concrete schedule but that also depends on how far up you move, managers work around the clock but if you want weekends off plan on staying as a low level associate and have your hours cut if you have that kind of manager. The workplace can be different in every store, while visually the same in most locations I have yet to see any two walmarts the same. I have always had a decent relationship with my management team and have heard many horror stories from others that I cannot relate to. I will forever be thankful that Wal-Mart hired me at such a young age (16, not sure if they still hire minors) and provided me with the years of work that they did. I am still with Wal-Mart and have been there almost 9 years, I tried a supervisor postion but being in my 20's I wasnt as dedicated as I should have been and chose to step down. I also still want to explore other career options so Wal-Mart has always worked with my school schedule and allowed me to pay for my schooling and has never threatened me with having to choose work or school. I will not be with Wal-Mart forever but for what its worth I will always be thankful - more...",4,Current Employee,Associate ,"Gilbert, AZ",3/5/18,2018,3,5

It's not worth it,"Walmart may be a huge company, but upon working there it seems like they just got lucky.  Horrible management, they don't even try to make you feel like you matter.  They hire practically anybody which really isn't a good thing cause you will end up having to work harder to make up for lazy associates.  I literally had someone threaten to slash my tires and beat me up.  Instead of firing them, they just moved me into another department.  I even had a supervisor sexually harass me and they actually punished me for coming forward because I ""must have gotten an unfair advantage from it"".  They did fire him, so that was good.  I quit soon after because when it came time for a raise I only got 20 cents.

"Cutbacks means more work, fewer workers","With the retail industry hemorrhaging for money they have gone the way of reducing the number of workers, inserting new process after new process, and telling the few workers who remain that these processes will make the same work doable with fewer people. You are expected to do more, in less time, and are rarely rewarded for your effort. The pay is competitive but still not worth the abuse from the increasingly volatile customer base, or the Management team that would rather throw you under the bus than deal with the reality of time not making sense for the job they want done.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Corpus Christi, TX",3/5/18,2018,3,5

"Flexible, But unprofessional",A very relaxed place to work. I don’t think the compensation is fair at all even for those of us that have college degrees.

The people there are great the managers not so much.,I enjoyed my time at Walmart and my co-workers and managers were great.

Can enjoy working there,"Overall I did enjoy working at Walmart, The only main issue I had was with management. They kept promising advancement but never did it. When I refused to do the work I was not being paid for. They asked me to step down from my current position. When I asked why, my store manager told me that it was because the Customer service managers, were not doing their job, I was doing it for them. So they needed to do their job. I informed my manager why would I be punished for doing the job that I was promised. And for that reason, I put in my two-week notice.",5,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative/Back-Up CSM ,"Keller, TX",3/4/18,2018,3,4
It's ok,The pay isn't worth it. It's constantly being changed. Rules are still getting changed. Overwhelming. Too many customers orders are never ready. Corporate kept raising amount of customers allowed to order despite short staff and losing employees when they start.  It's under new management.  Could be different. Always under pressure. Something always comes up. Management never responded when we were desperate for help. Was told grocery pickup was the most profitable and high demanding department. Even effects your bonus if we fail. It's a 50/50 job for me. I don't know how I feel for it.,4,Former Employee,Ecommerce personal shopper ,"Greenfield, IN",3/4/18,2018,3,4

Very hard company to work for.,The particular store i work for does not train you and expects you to know what to do in doing your job requirements. Employees do not work together to get a job done which decreases productivity. The management team is more interested in theirselves than the company just to advance in the rankings of the company. The customer should always come first and the company should be at the top of their lists to increase profitability. I spend more time fixing other shifts work and many times unable to do my duties. _x000D__x000D_Turn over for that store is very high because of the lack of training and the pressure to complete your job duties without others help.

Walmart Review,"Walmart was one of my favorite places to work. I really enjoyed the ability to have control over the cash register and I want to go back there so very badly but because I'm a single mother, I can't afford to work at the Rio Grande walmart because sometimes the hours get very low and it becomes hard to manage on a daily basis in a $1,400 rental town.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rio Grande, NJ 08242",3/3/18,2018,3,3
Walmart is a good place to work.  It is very fast paced  and they prefer that you have open availability.   The pay is fair for beginning workers.,If you’re scheduled to work they expect you to be there.   They do not like for you to call in to be off if you’re on the schedule.    You get an annual assessment and most times a slight payraise.   You can advance their but sometimes they only want to advance who they choose.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Jasper, AL",3/3/18,2018,3,3

Somewhat rewarding,"Working at Walmart has more cons than pros unfortunately. While the benefits and pay are fair, the people who work there and management are often rude and disorganized.

Company business issues,"The company has clear and well defined goals but fails to act on many occasions because of cutting hours and help. The managers manage on the seats of their pants and by that I mean they think short term gain and not long term. For Walmart salaried management think on a day-to-day basis. Their goal is to make it from one day to the next, often times they make short cuts or take routes that will hurt them long term to achieve the short term goal. To give an example, I worked as a Mod Team member. Some nights we work on short easy modulars and others on larger and more complex ones. At the end of the week I work 40 hours. 8 hours a night minus 30 minutes for paid breaks. Which means if I am working a mod that is going to take 9 hours to do and I need it done, sometimes I will take a 30 minute lunch and stay over 30 minutes and thus I am not 1 hour over my projected time. Well later in the week when I do shorter mods that require less time and finish early in the night, rather than allow me to take the hour off and go home early, I am given more work to do. In Management's eyes they get 7.5 hours of work out of me per day regardless of when and how I stay over, thus at the end of the week I now get in trouble for said actions. Walmart would do well if they would just stop thinking on a day to day basis and think more long term, weekly and monthly. Managers do a horrible job communicating clearly with each other, despite the home office's attempt to provide them with the tools to do it, email, notes app on the TC70 and MC40s, company cell phones, meetings...they still fail to communicate - more...",1,Former Employee,Overnight Cashier ,"New Tazewell, TN",3/2/18,2018,3,2

The workplace culture can be fine when it comes to things like benefits, holiday's, and the like but the hardest part of the job is the aforementioned lack of staffing, leaving a person with more on their plate than necessary.

"A somewhat decent place to work, but not for the faint of heart.","My job experience at Wal-Mart was somewhat what I expected, but definitely the opposite in certain areas. The pay is quite good, but they work you to death for it. I was making $9.50 an hour as a Photo Lab/ Electronics Associate, but after completing my 30 day computer training courses I was bumped up to $10.50. I was getting between 30-36 hours a week, and I was enjoying it for the most part in the beginning. I was enjoying it until I realized how Wal-Mart works. Management generally does not care about the needs of associates, unless it breaks corporate policy. Wal-Mart as a whole does not care about the personal lives of their associates as well. They simply want you to come in, work your shift, then ask you to stay over, and then tell you to go home because you have too much overtime. Department managers are treated like pack mules, except for the store manager's favorites, which means the DMs who get treated badly go off on their associates. Almost every associate in the store had a complaint about their department/department managers/ or the assistant manager over their area. Many associates would be given write-ups for the most ridiculous things, such as their productivity within their first week. Wal-Mart does not expect their department managers to go into extensive training with their newly hired associates, and so many of them are lost on what to do, and most of the time the department's self-trained associates have to take the wheel. I can't tell you how many times the other associates and I had to train new associates, or do our department manger's job for them. - more...",4,Former Employee,Photo Lab Technician ,"Millbrook, AL",3/1/18,2018,3,1

In a hot day, no air conditioning in the break room, in a cold day is opposite : no heat !  Walmart do have air conditioning and heating systems, don't get me wrong. They just don't install it in break room  for employees ! NO !  You want to have cool air in a hot day ?

Walmart TLE,"Working for Walmart TLE as a technician is one of the easiest jobs I ever held.  TLE associates frequently arrived late or didn't bother to show.  Techs could spend most of the day hiding, sleeping or playing games on their smartphones while customers waited hours for routine services like oil changes and tire work.  There were virtually no time constraints for various services and no quota system in place for the number of cars techs worked on per day that I could tell.  Techs could make up all types of excuses why they could not perform service on customers cars.  TLE techs could log onto jobs for vehicles they didn't perform service on and get credited for work. TLE techs didn't get disciplined or retrained for leaving lug nuts loose, oil fill caps left off, loose oil filters, loose oil drain plugs or stripping oil pan drain plug threads...even if the error resulted in costly repairs.  TLE techs could spend hours on their smartphones checking Facebook accounts and watching YouTube and nobody seemed to mind much.  Even though the shop had cameras all over TLE techs routinely were permitted to bring their personal vehicles in for service and work on them sometimes bumping customers already in the computer queue. Managers rarely denied any PTO requests.  The non-TLE associates were always very pleasant to work with and the store manager provided associates with very nice meals free of charge during the holidays.  The CBL training was very easy to pass. The TLE customers were always very nice and frequently offered generous tips to TLE techs that completed service error free - more...",4,Former Employee,TLE Associate ,New York State,3/1/18,2018,3,1

It's Wal-Mart,"I'm honestly glad I no longer have to deal with all of the nonsense involved in working at Wal-Mart. When I very first started out I was actually happy to work there and typically had a nice time. However, in recent months I experienced nothing but suffering. Between constantly being busy, never having enough associates to feed the demand of customers and the occasional uncouth customer, I had almost constant head aches. At least I did learn some good tricks along the way. Firstly, I have developed an incredible level of patience, the tolerance of having several people ask you for help at once and how best to coordinate with my teammates. Management was typically nice to me and helped out whenever possible but they were often just as stretched out as the rest of us so not always reliable.I'd definitely say the most enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart was being able to help people out, be entertaining and be able to light up someone's day.

Horrible.,"First of all, i would rate them no stars._x000D_All the managers are trash. Not even just the department manager, everyone above them as well.  No one cares how you’re doing, or cares to properly train you. You ask one question and they seem annoyed by it. Always seemed in a rush as if they didn’t have time to explain clearly. So if they say ‘they really care about their employees’ don’t believe that bull. Very unorganized as well. Dept. manager would ask other dept manager a question and they’d always say ‘i don’t know’ , pathetic. Managers are pretty bossy as well, make up all kinds of unnecessary rules that don’t even make sense. But hey, whatever makes them feel powerful over you, right? Lazy people would pass stuff onto you too. Probs the worst place i’ll ever work.",1,Former Employee,Cap 1 ,"Mesa, AZ",2/27/18,2018,2,27

I have learned form Wal-Mart about the importance of allowing the computer system to do its job and working with it for the best outcome.  Wal-Mart is accepting of all types of people from all different nationalities and providing for them as well.

Stressful yet satisfying.,"There really is never a typical day at Walmart, things always change and there were always new challenges to overcome. However, each day started with a walk around the store to quickly address any major issues that might need to be taken care from the overnight shift. Once all emails and administrative duties were taken care of, tours would start to give department managers and associates direction. The rest of the day was follow up and planning for upcoming events, budgets, resets, etc. Of course throughout the day there are customer service concerns, associate concerns, vendor issues, home office calls, and numerous other issues that would be addressed accordingly. _x000D_The culture at Walmart is to strive for work/life balance but that sometimes would prove to be easier said than done. The hardest part of the job was trying to spend time with your family and take your scheduled days off, while feeling the need to be at the store to help with heavy workloads. _x000D_The best part about the job was that it was always different and always busy. There was always something to plan for, always a new goal to achieve, and always a new challenge waiting each day.",4,Former Employee,Asset Protection Manager ,"Commerce, MI",2/27/18,2018,2,27

Change is constant.,"The world of retail is a constant change. One day you may be looking for something to keep you busy to  the next day having high quantity of merchandise with no place to go complected with the high demand of customer service. Sometimes the roller coaster ride can be overwhelming and very stressful. Walmart has a unique work culture, it is a world of its own. Any one coming in should be open to anything from a strong since of family to a clash of personalities in coworkers and customers. Walmart has some great programs and policies in place to take care of the associates from health benefits to discounts. But because it is a company that focuses on customer service some times people can not see past the drama of a large work place. Again change is constant, that would include management. Some looking to improve themselves over others but many that look to improve the store and the associates.

Walmart's philosophy has changed from family first to money.,"I returned to work for Walmart after a 10 year absence. I had worked for them from 10/91-03/06. Back then, Mr Sam Walton felt it to be important to put family first. He then stated that caring for the associates was a top priority as well. Together, the business he created thrived. I returned to find them now open for Thanksgivings and Easter. Family values were now replaced by greed. Benefits for associates gradually disappeared.

Communicating and executing the daily business needs while having a proactive outllook on upcoming trends.,"A typical day in Wal-Mart management is prioritizing the daily needs of the business and adapting to whatever comes up along the way. I have learned inner personal skills, the art of delegating, and how to prioritize tasks. The management team lacks necessary communication skills and sharing credit for others contributions.

Good benefits if you work there long enough,They start you off with part time at this location some days are busier then the next. 1$ raise after three months.

Stressful!,"Management is the worst. Whether or not they started from the bottom, they have unrealistic expectations for  you or your team. Working in pharmacy for a few years had me extrememly stressed out, resulting in anxiety. The pay is okay for a single person or one child. Pharmacy laws change constantly and there's no time for training because the customer is always first. It seems upper management sets you up for failure with unrealistic expectations and numbers that have to be met. You are expected to know all the laws, standard operating procedures, and POMS by heart when asked, like you don't have customers to worry about or deadlines to be met that they set. There's almost always no coverage. Customers can get you in trouble if they don't like you, because ""they are always right"". Schedule is flexible sometimes. Coworkers...let's say some are hard working and others are pretenders. Benefits and discounts are not worth it. In my opinion, its only good for a temporary job. There's too much gossiping between other employees of the store which is a con. This is simply my own personal review. Goodluck",2,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Colorado Spring, NM",2/26/18,2018,2,26
Great place to work in the beginning,"The store had a wonderful management team in the beginning.

working in the TLE of walmart,"i would have to say that working in the TLE is fairly busy work you are not wearing just one or two hats.  being a TLE associate is like wearing four to five hats ranging from,  stock-man, cashier, customer service, service writer.  seems the rest of the store doesn't give respect to the TLE areas and tends to put more demand on the performance of the TLE associates no matter if lacking in numbers and man power.",3,Current Employee,ACC sales associate ,"Ottumwa, IA 52501",2/25/18,2018,2,25
"Overall very good experience, limited botherations.","A typical work day as a cashier at the Walmart where I work starts out with clocking in, followed by being assigned to a register. The better part of the time, breaks are up to 30 minutes behind schedule. Other than that, there is not much to complain about up front. I have learned a great deal of information while working at Walmart. I have learned essentially how the company runs, and how it makes money. I have also learned more people skills, and how to work under stress or pressure. The management at this Walmart is customarily helpful and kind, but certain members of management can be discourteous and ill-mannered. Some of them seem to get angry or frustrated when they have to show someone how to do something or explain something to a customer. The workplace culture is ordinarily positive, and most employees get along just fine. The hardest part of being a cashier, in my opinion, is essentially being blamed by customers for any problems with merchandise. On the contrary, one of the most enjoyable parts of the job is meeting new people and building people skills by interacting with customers and co-workers.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Pontiac, IL",2/25/18,2018,2,25

"Productive, Friendly, Customer and Employee focused","A typical day at work involved going to the shift meeting and learning the routine and standards for that night, after the meeting I'd go to my usual place at organizing merchandise or I'd be directed to be a cashier for the night and overlook the self-serve point-of-sale stations. what I learned while at Walmart is that work truly was a team effort. We had our own individual standards to meet in our respective jobs, but how well the shift went depended heavily on keeping a steady pace at all times. My managers were a wonderful and diverse cast of characters who all took the company mission statement and needs of the employees seriously. they would be compassionate yet stern in their work, especially when often times I would be working side by side with one of my managers. Workplace culture was like many retail jobs such as customers first, and keeping a safe and maintained workplace. The hardest part of the job was mostly keeping up with the increasingly difficult individual standards we were faced with as sales floor employees.

customer satisfaction is number one,"This company cares more about customer satisfaction so much that they often overlook the needs of their own associates. When it comes time to taking vacations its often near impossible to get approved let along a paid vacation. Doctor/ emergency visits dont account for missing or being late even if you told management ahead of time. Even if you are sick you are expected to endure your full shift with exceptional service. Benefits are limited and given within a time frame. Most of management is biased. The store manager is awesome his only downfall are his asm,s he has leading behind him. i wish well to this facility as they are changing management and that they succeed in the future.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/sales rep ,"Williston, ND",2/25/18,2018,2,25

"An Average Night A ""Walmart""","During my average night at Walmart, i must first get to work on time of course. Next, other co-workers and i start the night with a regular meeting with the managers and co-managers telling us about the work load or how the night is going to proceed. When the meeting is over and i greet my co-workers i check on my personal work load/ freight. My steps to getting my labor done fast is to first separate and organize freight on carts the on by one work it on the shelves in the store. Working in the cold means you must keep an eye one time because some merchandise consist to be certain temperatures either really cold or really dry. The hardest part is getting work done thoroughly and providing customers 100 percent assistant and satisfaction.

The enviroment,I worked 3rds and id go right to the refrigerator and freezer and see what the truck brought me that night to put away and usually I was always busy so id get to working to make sure the next day is fully stocked for the customers and the business. The hardest part would be in the freezer getting things sorted as its really cold so I would always have gloves and winter clothing. I enjoyed unloading the trucks and sorting out everything and putting them in their place.

Skeleton Crew & Incompetant Management,"At my location, we were on a skeleton crew nearly always. The managers were often at odds with each other, fighting over the decent associates, while the associates that did little work were asked much less--while getting the same pay!Advancement is difficult, and even the middle management isn't compensated properly for the amount of work they are asked to do./Almost/ everyone either broke company policy to make themselves look better, or didn't know what they were doing. This was essentially necessitated by pressure from management to meet unrealistic expectations.",2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Reno, NV",2/25/18,2018,2,25

Great People | New Management,"Working for Walmart for nearly a year, I saw many different things. There were a large amount of people who enjoyed their work and the people with whom they worked, and then there were those who were actively trying to make it unbearable to be there. The store manager seemed to be a genuine person, but all of managers (assistants included) were relatively new. Only one associate in the back was licensed to use power equipment, and was not there every day. The place was great to be in and I would go back in an instant. However, even with passing supervisory tests and continually proving my capability to perform the tasks of a supervisor or a lead elsewhere in the building, there were never any interviews for the positions to my knowledge (several positions for a significant pay increase were open for several months without being filled). I forced my attendance points to go over the limit to see if it would prompt action in either a positive or negative way, and then negatively I got a response._x000D__x000D_I come back a few months later just to do some shopping and run into a few old coworkers, and through them I find out that the positions STILL were not filled. (This is about 5 months after the initial posting of the position, now) This assured me that the faith I had lost in the company was well deserved to have been lost. If change could be guaranteed on their part, I could guarantee a change on mine._x000D__x000D__x000D_TL;DR_x000D_It was an awesome place, but the managers didn't allow advancement or training despite saying they wanted to train every single associate on power jacks.",4,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Lancaster, PA",2/25/18,2018,2,25
Very result focused,"This was a place that was only concerned about the bottom line. I can't speak for all centers, but the one I was working at was so focused on the numbers that we often felt unappreciated. Too often were those of us who came to work every day given unfair treatment and the unreliable workers weren't forced to answer for their actions.",2,Current Employee,Orderfiller ,"Douglas, GA",2/25/18,2018,2,25
"Great brand, good job for sales practice.","The hardest part of this job was communication. Everybody trying to do everything at once, instead of being a team. No focus or certainty.

The same through and through,"I worked at the distribution center for almost 5 years and in that time I had seen Walmart take more and more from the associates but ask for more and more out of them. While the pay was good, it wasn't worth having to not only do my job but do other's jobs as well. As a high level manager stated ""get more out of your associates"". That job was a good way to get your feet planted and to get your life started but I would not recommend staying in the company to anyone.

Easy to learn and friendly environment,"As a cashier, you are constantly greeting people all day long. If you are not a people person, I would not recommend. It may help some get over their anxiety because you are, in a lot of ways, forced to make conversation. If you are ringing items up for someone and it's just silent, I would feel that's uncomfortable, so I definitely recommend small talk. Every shift gave you two 10 minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch. For me personally, an hour is a long time and I would usually be bored for the one half hour. But it is nice if you wanted to go home for lunch, or run errands, etc. You don't get a lot of moments to speak with your coworkers during your shift, but on breaks/lunch, you're free to do so. Overall, it was an easy job and kept you busy.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Akron, OH",2/24/18,2018,2,24

Efficient high stress fast paced customer service,"The hardest part about working here was being understaffed as it was a fast paced environment where you were expected to give superior efficient quick service with a smile.   This would cause the cash register lines to back up creating angry customers.  It was our job, being the last person they saw, to make sure we solved there issues and leave with a positive feeling and a smile.  The most enjoyable part of working here was dealing with all the customers and seeing there purchases.  It is a great place to work if you like to talk to strangers and customers love to talk,  Managers were very fair and understanding and tried to work with the staff and accomodate them as much as they could but customers always came first. What I learned is that people will talk to cashiers like they talk to bartenders, i wa shocked the things people would tell me after only asking them ""How are you""",5,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"North Tonawanda, NY",2/24/18,2018,2,24

overall a decent place to work,"I found the store you work at highly effects you workplace experience.

fun place with the right people,"to be honest I never worked in a TLE shop before Walmart I always fixed my own cars and things like that so this was a complete experience for me, the people I worked with were really appreciative, and well respected people, I never had any issues working there, the only thing that I can say I didn't enjoy about working at Walmart is they try to transfer you to different departments when ever they want, and some times customers can be really rude.",3,Former Employee,TLE Service Technician ,"Commerce City, CO",2/24/18,2018,2,24

Wal Mart was great except pay is horrible and benefits don't exist.,"I am a high energy person who needs to stay busy, my position at Wal Mart filled that need. I learned a lot about cuts of meat, price mark downs, and that when Wal Mart hires you for a remodel, it is nothing at all like remodeling a house. The management there was great as were all my co-workers, each one of them taught me at least one or two things about the department that they worked in. My favorite thing about working there would have to be a toss up between helping people and learning new things. I love to do both.",5,Former Employee,Meat Sales Associate ,"DuQuoin, Il",2/24/18,2018,2,24

Exciting place to work as well as advancement,I really enjoyed the Wal-mart management team in Kentucky and Norfolk better than Petersburg/colonial heights. The out of town team was very good with your work performance and offered you advancement and raises for your performance on working with the company. Wal-mart was there for me when my son passed away in 2008 when I worked in Kentucky store. Management and employees came to funeral as well as donated flowers and took up donations.

Daily life at Walmart,Normally you get to work and you log into your computer and get everything ready for the day. Then you take your first phone call. Normally it is super busy with back to back calls and other times it is slow with 10-45 minutes between calls. If you like to work somewhere where you get yelled at all day long and can keep a professional demeanor about it. This is the place for you.,3,Former Employee,Resolution Specialist I ,"Bentonville, AR",2/24/18,2018,2,24

Easy going work place.,Low pay and not enough hours. However the environment was enjoyable and the associates are friendly. I was there for remodel so some of the managers from other stores did not get along with each other which made it difficult for us working under them and just being hired as new employees. Also I received low pay for very hard work.,3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Charlotte, NC",2/24/18,2018,2,24

The pay is good -- when you can get hours,"The only way to do that is by completely opening your schedule, otherwise you get the dregs. To make matters worse, hours were cut, so you were lucky to get what you can. Low sales, heavily impacted by people not coming in, being short staffed, or poorly thought out schedules. Having a full house during the day, but only one or two people to close in Apparel means nothing can ever stay clean or organized._x000D__x000D_And don't even get me started on the managers, lack of benefits (I was told I'd need to work here 2-3 years just to get healthcare), the rumors of them closing down stores to make up for the raise in pay, etc.",2,Current Employee,APPAREL SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Valdosta, GA",2/24/18,2018,2,24

Challenging opportunity in Retail Environment,"Training within the assigned department by key lead employees really provided me with proper procedures and expectations quickly.  Not all departments have cross training, but is something that helped me to be well versed to assist with daily activities when understaffed on the Sales floor.  _x000D_Working as part of a team in larger departments is my favorite. Taking on resets and product displays as well as stocking floor product from receiving trucks nightly is lots of fun.  Having the tools such as a pricing tool and printer, labels, store supplies to repair opened packages makes my work output much more effective and effecient.  Knowing the store layout in the General Merchandise area provides the Customer the best in store experience.  I provide results the Customers have learned to expect.  And I like to have the answers.  This makes for a win win situation and that is the most enjoyable part of the job.  The hardest part of the job is being on your feet 8 hours daily and walking, walking, walking.  The store is  huge and to do daily tasks requires pulling freight from back, taking cardboard to baler, retreiving baskets to work department freight for stocking.  Zoning my area is always a challenge and I can really get into organizing and making the shelves on the floor in my department look really good.  I stay busy all day helping Customers, ringing up purchases, and providing answers and assistance for management and other Associates as needed.  I don't mind the work, I just want to make a decent living putting in my time and effort to make for a positive shopping experience - more...",3,Current Employee,Sporting Goods Sales Associate ,"Hurst, TX",2/24/18,2018,2,24

Consistent hours but slow advancement,"At the location I work at, I've always worked my full 40 hours and hardly ever had my hours cut; that's the positive part. The negative part is that there is hardly ever any career advancement for anyone wanting to work their way up. I've been with the company for nearly 4 years and I've worked several different positions learning as much as I can. I've even taken pay cuts when I moved between positions in hopes of learning from my training to move further up. However, somehow every time an opportunity comes up where I can take the mantle of a department manager or something similar, a member of management informs me that the position has either been given to a transfer, it's been consolidated with another department (which happens a lot with the group B locations), or it requires an individual with more familiarity with the One Best Way (something that is hardly discussed with us in our meetings). The lack of communication between shifts is a major problem, and it all begins with management. I'm not saying the problem is entirely them; it's just the way it's handled. Unless this changes, guys like me who want a chance to advance will never get far.",3,Current Employee,Inventory Associate ,"La Mesa, CA",2/24/18,2018,2,24
walmart,"Good place to work, but management doesnt fully do there jobs they do the minimum and blame the lower associates, the group of people that i worked with disagreed alot and was really lazy about customer service, took longer breaks then scheduled, no communitcation between techs about what has been done on what and what is left to be done, not to many people would clean or finish jobs they would walk off and nothing would ever get done to people that break the rules and you see special treatment to certain people and its very obvious.",4,Current Employee,Full Time Employee ,"Carbondale, IL",2/24/18,2018,2,24

You have so many older generations working there. Its hard to keep up with the policies with their health and others. But it would work if your management's favorite. But it is what it is. I would never go back. The job is for persons that are in high school or college. They just raised it after how many years?

Great if you intend to advance into a management career or marketing.,"I found management to be incompetent most of the time. The pay does not represent the work as a full-time associate. It can be a very fun and active place to work but it would be wise to go into the job with intent on moving way up. Benefits such as healthcare are hard to beat when it comes to this company.

The employees were great and so were the customers. I had my areas ( Toys and Hair & Beauty) to always stock up and zone my areas so the customers can see a neat section and can see everything as they walk pass. The hardest part about working at Walmart is working on the holidays. Customers come in and get last minute things then we do not have it we have to call different Walmart location and see if they have the item , when they say no they do not or they have to wait a few days the customers get angry , upset and get mad with us but we try everything we can to help.

"High stress, low paying, and not much to make up for it.","The learning curve at Walmart can vary greatly with what department you are hired for but the level of training you receive is always inadequate. You are expected to always keep up with a demanding work pace no matter the conditions and if you manage to, there is almost never any real recognition. It seems that the entire management team changes yearly leaving very little room for personal acquaintance with your superiors. The one major positive reason to work here is a forgiving attendance policy along with adjustable scheduling to work around school or other needs. But as with most retail jobs, there are very few full time positions to be found at the store. Part time work does not cover any form of insurance or consistent benefits, the most financial assistance you will receive is the 10% discount card after working there for longer than 3 months.",2,Former Employee,Front end Cashier and self-checkout host ,"Victorville, CA",2/21/18,2018,2,21

The worst part wasn't the customers, or the managers, technically, but the constant demand to do things that weren't in my job description. Moving to other departments or the front end put me in positions that I wasn't trained for during rush hour, stressing me out significantly. If that doesn't bother you, your biggest concern will be the back and forth between insufficient hours and 39 hours with no consistent schedule (off at 11pm, back at 7am), all while expecting standards that the company as a whole doesn't maintain.

Apply with Caution,"Typical day at work was signing in to computer, check emails throughout the day and process invoices and other tasks that were assigned. Task weren't difficult when I originally started. Takes anywhere from 3 to 6 months to grasp everything and be comfortable with what you are doing. But there were constant changes that seemed unnecessary throughout me being employed there, which made it stressful and tedious. Most of the managers there weren't much help and how much help you received was mostly based off of favoritism. Advancement was sparingly and if a position was available within the last few months it was due to others being let go due to not meeting production standards or attendance. Seen a lot of employees come and go...Quickly!  Overall it was a decent job..met a handful of nice co-workers that were like family to me. The hardest part was keeping up with production. Adapting to change is reasonable but adapting to constant change with confusing aspects is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

The ten foot rule was never used amongst employees. Management was very unprofessional at times. A lot of name calling in front of peers and bullying amongst peers.

organized work place,Employees must show up 5-10 mins  before shift so you can clock in on time. One thing I learned about Walmart is that there food is always freshly stocked.

Great place to meet interesting people,"your typical day at this job was not typical. Everyday was completely different. As your day begins you would go change into your uniform and name tag and punch in. Then you would if you were a special team associate like me you would be required to run multiple departments at one time. My team was Cap 2 so we ran all of the shipping and receiving, we ran 7 departments at one time not including but limited to the surrounding departments when customers asked questions you needed general knowledge over. Our departments were Chemicals, Foods, Pharmacy, Cosmetics, Health and Beauty, Pets, Shipping and Receiving, We also had to run various other departments should the need for associates from customers arose. Management was okay. Not the best as working for this company you have multiple bosses at any given time. You would also be required to take multiple tests per day in order to complete your training in full and training  could take up to 1 full year. I completed 80% of my training before the 5 month of my employment. The hardest part was not knowing if you were doing a good job or not knowing the product you were going to sell to the customer, and also dealing with ignorant, employees that felt because of there time there that they were better than you because they had been there longer. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you were helping customers achieve happiness in the products they bought.

"13 years ago it was great, now everything is falling apart.","They are cutting hours, cutting job positions, and increasing work loads beyond what individuals can logically do. When I first started I was told to stay in my department unless a customer asked for help in another. Now they are expecting a handful of employees to take care of multiple departments. They also cut back office positions, piling a workload onto claims.

Ridiculous Rules,"I absolutely hated working at Walmart. I applied thinking that it would be easy, but the policies they have in place are ridiculous and totally unreasonable. You have to complete training videos and a working profile, but are hardly ever given time to actually complete anything. But at the same time, if you don't complete it you could be fired. It makes no sense. Also, the higher ups never collaborate with themselves. I asked to take time off for maternity leave and told one manager I'd be gone for four weeks when she told me i could take 6 weeks.

Stressful work environment and poor management.,"A typical day at work consist of having a meeting, going to your assigned area, stocking the product, labeling the overstock, cleaning and zoning the area. I learned if management knows of an employee having a technical issue, then management should address the problem instead of just writing the employee up. The workplace culture created a negative atmosphere because of management blaming employees and employees blaming each other because they did not want to get written up. The hardest part of the job is poor management which created stress and the foot pain, but the foot pain can be dealt with using Tylenol. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay, the benefits, and the pride of knowing that you are doing a good job regardless of the hypocritical atmosphere.",3,Former Employee,Retail Stocker ,"Omaha, NE",2/20/18,2018,2,20
Walmart experience,Walmart is the perfect place for a full time student due to flexible hours however depending of the positions the hours are not stable depending on the time of the year.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Pullman, WA",2/20/18,2018,2,20
nightmarish,"A day at work includes balancing cooking and keeping food fresh, serving customers what they order, and cleaning everything by the end of the night. I learned how to use new equipment and manage my time. All members of management have varying amounts of knowledge and experience in each department. This means that some of the assistant managers and/or store managers may have no idea what a regular day in your department looks like. Communication between each of them is severely lacking and you can be told multiple different answers to the same question. There are days, sometimes even weeks when you wont see a manager all day until an even higher member of management visits the store. Once this happens you may have managers watching your every move demanding you do things they not only wouldn't do themselves, but don't understand entirely. The other employees are generally very accepting and make you feel at home. The hardest part of the job is dealing with clueless management, trying to keep the food case full, cleaning, keeping the floor stocked, training new associates, and helping customers all at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the bonuses and decent hours depending on how hard you work.",2,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Los Angeles, CA",2/20/18,2018,2,20
Be ready for anything,"With working at a place where sales are important it can be a little difficult getting important projects done. The need for sales should never outway what a customer needs. I could come into work and have to do something that I've never seen before but looked interesting to try and figure out. I Most of my focus was on lawn & garden area and sometimes the seasonal area. If you work in lawn and garden get a hat because it can get really hot being in the sun all the time. If you have to work in the season are just remember the net holiday that comes around. all in all, I liked working are Walmart. it was super fun but it also taught me a lot.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Overland Park, KS",2/20/18,2018,2,20
Poor management,It is managed poorly from the top down.  Job expectations are hardly achievable and they are constantly stripping away benefits and making the job more difficult. Employee input on changes to daily operation  are ignored and there is no feeling of job security no matter how hard you work.

Walmart Customer Host,"This position was fairly new at the time and no one was clear on the true description of what we did. It’s a position that requires true patience since you are an offshoot of Asset Protection. We had no radios; only scanners for returns. I felt like we should’ve been more secure than we were since we do stand at the entrances and guard them. Customers can be rude and they feel like you have no right to do the job you’re paid to do. It’s not an easy job being involved with theft. It’s a very “gray area” job. If your management is good, you’re good. If not, you’ll suffer and it shows as time progresses. Every employee felt overwhelmed and were quitting left and right. But if you do your job and go home you’re fine. No friends at this job and a lot of people you can’t trust. It can be a drama filled environment depending on location.",3,Former Employee,Customer Host I ,"Columbus, GA",2/20/18,2018,2,20

It was an interesting work place,A typical day at work for me at Walmart was a bit different from the day work. I worked from 10 PM - 7 AM so it was a little bit more laid back. We stocked most of the time and then towards the end of the night we cleaned up. The times I worked for sure taught me customer service and a lot of teamwork. It was hard at first to work with people I didn't really like but it taught me to set my differences aside and do the work. The management was OK. Some managers were a little harder to work with but that is to be expected. The workplace was like I said very laid back but it was very much different from the day workers. Which made the job a little bit easier but I would say the hardest part of the job was probably the schedule. It was hard to be on a sleep schedule where you're up all night and sleeping all day even on your days off. Which probably is really the only hard part but the easiest would be the work itself. It was mainly just taking palettes into your assigned aisle and stocking all of the products on the palettes in a timely manner. This did get hard if you didn't get much sleep but that's the only thing that made it hard. As long as you slept well and are OK with the weird sleep schedule then this is for sure the job for you.,4,Former Employee,Overnight Associate ,"Galt, CA",2/19/18,2018,2,19
Walmart has changed.,"Wal-Mart used to be a great place to work. Now, it isn't so good. Hours have been cut with the new pay rate, so paychecks are smaller.

The main entrance and the customer service desk is clean and ready for business. I use my device to say good morning to the overnight manager, so they can meet me for a tour. I walk with my assistant managers around the racetrack of the store, asking questions and assessing the store, while planning what needs to be done for the day. I have learned to be fair but firm during my tours. Speaking to every associates and customers all day, everyday and asking customers if they need assistance. One of the hardest thing about the job was keeping a full staff management team.

Jobs not worth the pay,As a door greater you make 12 dollars.  And as a cap 2 member you make 11. In all reality your doing all of the work in the store  but unloading trucks spring the pallets. Never having a solid standing on what you will be doing that day.You can do all of grocery and Chen's by yourself but the managers who get paid 100-200k a year will come down and say your doing a horrible job. And that you have to stay late to zone  all of foods and liquids while being stopped by coustomers and helping everyone with the 10 foot rule and if you don't make any mistakes.  This job is not worth it in anyway. Unless your management can learn to balance the workload.your technically screwed.   I would not say that working at a cap 2 member is viable unless the wage is brought up to 16 dollars an hour   while  door greaters make 12 really consider what your doing if your applying as a cap 2 member.,3,Current Employee,Cap team 2 ,Wareham,2/18/18,2018,2,18

I can't think of many good things to say. the people you work with are friendly but the pay sucks for what you do.,A typical day would be clear the floor of freight.  Cap the bins.  Put stock on shelves.  Setup for truck coming in.  I learned how lazy some people are.  The management is heartless. you ask for a day off and they deny it.  The hardest part of the job is dragging pallets around the GM side for the truck load the pallets are stacked so high you can't reach them.

Working at Wal-Mart,"I was a sales associate for sporting goods, paint, hardware, and automotive. I learned how to mix paint and sell guns. Management did a walk about every morning and when they were done walking your area they would tell you what needed to be done or what needed to be fixed.

Somewhat repetitive workdays,"It always seemed to be a rush to get things done, I learned to have some respect for those who work in large stores like Walmart, management can be a little pushy but try to be nice and at the end of the day they just want the job done, I would say the hardest part is trying to be a perfect worker, trying to balance customer satisfaction/assistance and getting all of your tasks done for the day, is difficult especially on busy days.

The people you work with is the best thing about this job and some of the managers are really easy to get along with. However there are so many managers with each one wanting the same thing done differently and it can get a little overwhelming. _x000D_They promote from the inside and its more of who you know than if you qualify for the job so you have to really put yourself out there if you want to move up._x000D_Pay is very good especially for retail and their benefits package is great.

Decent Job If Temporary,"I worked at Walmart for nearly four years and have had minimal problems with other associates or customers. My biggest problems came from select managers that would ask of just too much from one person while others would spend an entire shift doing half the job. I was fired for excessive occurrences while half my crew had already excessive occurrences before I had topped out. The job was easy for the pay and I'd go back over and over again, I just think sometimes certain workers are accused more than others who should be looked at long before the hard workers.",3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"La Junta, CO",2/16/18,2018,2,16

However, in typical retail fashion, they will make you work as close to 40 hours as possible, and get upset when you go over your hours even though they will be the ones to ask you to stay over. Had nothing to do with my performance but with the lack of performance from other co-workers not getting their part done (and managers not keeping enough staff to adequately keep up with the daily demands of several departments).",3,Former Employee,IMS • Service Desk • Cash Office ,"Walnut Ridge, AR",2/16/18,2018,2,16

over all reasonable company,"Walmart's best quality is the opportunity to be promoted. Any starting employee can qualify for the next pay grade. The first skill I learned on the job was time management. I was usually given several tasks at the beginning of my shift and was expected to finish them by the end. Upon promotion, I learned to deal with issues fluently. Almost daily, I have problems that are completely new and unique. Through watching my peers at work and experience on the job, I learned to never be overwhelmed. This is perhaps the most difficult part of my job. The pure variety of challenges can feel stifling.

Needs more structure,"Walmart is a billion dollar company with billion dollar problems. Benefits are the only thing that keeps employees clocking in. The pay is not competitive at all. More time and money is put into bringing in seasonal employees with no work experience, but they take minimum wage, so its a win for that current stores payroll. You can compare employee development to that dad who went to the store to get cigarettes and never came back. Its not there.",2,Former Employee,Night Manager ,"North Augusta, SC",2/16/18,2018,2,16
"Good people working there,brings the place together well.",Walmart makes sure the employees have proper benefits for the job that they do but can be a bit unorganized at times.

Wal-Mart,The hardest part of the job is being new and trying to tell an old veterans what the manager's expect. They think because they have been there longer you can not tell them anything.

Walmart Review,"During a typical day, I would greet people, restock shelves with returns, and when necessary, gather carts from the parking lot. Management at my particular Walmart was not very good.

Overall good job,"I enjoy most of the people there, real down to earth. I enjoy the challenges the job brings, no two days are usually the same. One of the main complaints I have is being asked to stay past scheduled hours and later not being compensated for it. Most of the time even if pressured to stay, you're then requested to take your overtime off. I've been vocal about further training/advice on promoting to supervisory positions for a couple years, not sure why I haven't been given opportunities, although receiving great feedback on job performance from management and those I work with directly. I'm constantly seeking pointers on what I should do to help achieve goals, and on how to better myself as an employee to further advance my career, even after positive feedback. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing my team and I be successful in completing tasks and being flexible/versatile as individuals.",4,Current Employee,Unloader/Backroom Inventory/Cap Team 2 ,"Jonesboro, AR",2/16/18,2018,2,16

Good company with a few bad apples,"It was great experience working at Walmart up until the last year.  Integrity, leadership, and training has been compromised by new inexperienced managers with hidden agendas. Quality of work is poor and store numbers have dropped considerably.  Prior to their arrival, I learned a great deal about how to operate with management involving all store logistics and protocols. Workplace culture was exciting and I always learned something new.  A typical day consisted of apprehending shoplifters and recovering stolen merchandise, working with the police.  The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the chaos of Black Friday.",3,Current Employee,Asset Protection/Produce Associate Manager ,"Norcross, GA",2/16/18,2018,2,16

As a customer service manager, the front end was my responsibility along with at least 2 other customer service managers. Getting support from upper management was very difficult._x000D_The hardest part of my job was when I would have a disgruntled customer and would have to call upper management to assist with the problem.

N/a,Walmart was once a company that was proven to be job secured but since the new CEO's took over that all have changed. Walmart doesnt give a work/life balance to its employees at all.

I learned from them as much as I when I was running the training seminars.  In the 90's and early 2000's there was many opportunities for growth.

Great Company with a great culture,I worked at the home office for five years in the late 1990's when Walmart still had many of the original leaders that made the company great.  It is a huge company but is a great place to learn how the retail business works.  I enjoyed the culture and team atmosphere and understand that the culture is not what it used to be.

Sometimes fast-paced environment with capable and willing coworkers,"Fast-paced work environment with a focus on the customer above product. Unfortunately, they do not seem to take care of their older employees, what with the Pathways program that  was introduced to help the hiring process that ultimately put a pay difference between old and new employees.

Your Team,The people you work with and are in the trenches with are the ones who make this job worth it.  Spending as much time away from home as you do it makes it better to ahve a good team that battles for one another.

For Better or Worse,"The work was not that difficult, but it could be stressful at times, due to either customer or management actions.

Good hiding place for employees that did not want to really work,5,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Las Cruces, NM",2/13/18,2018,2,13
Shifting priorities of leadership create volatility,"I've been with Walmart almost ten years now and started as a skeptic and cynic. My hourly experience was decent for a retail environment - time off and benefits are competitive, training is improving all the time, and there CAN be a friendly and cohesive atmosphere. My experience in management has seen repeated consolidation of departments, changes in workflow and expectations, and generally a downward motion in morale and a happy work environment. When leadership changes at a market, regional, divisional or senior leadership level the results vary greatly. The idea that there is a place in the company for most anyone has gone by the wayside in favor of coach or be coached (written up) and a 'healthy paranoia' of keeping one's job. Pressure from online retailers has driven the company to a less than favorable place in their way of handling things: people in particular. Goals have become outlandish and the resources to meet those goals non existent.",3,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Plymouth, IN",2/13/18,2018,2,13

Worn Down?,"Choose your stores wisely, Know your management. This is critical in advancement. If you are trying to make this a career make sure you get to know all and be the best you. Be ready to play multiple roles and be worn down. The drama upon employees is unreal. I learned all areas in one year. Also, favoritism is really big.

average,Management was unwilling to work with employees when something happened. They also didnt resolve problems within the store. I feel as though they need better training instead of throwing people into their positions,3,Former Employee,Pharmacy OTC Department Manager ,"Mesa, AZ",2/13/18,2018,2,13
Varies by store,"First of all, expect to be treated very poorly by customers. And depending on the store, by the management as well.

The other (last) store I worked at was unbearable because everyone was burnt out and didn't care about anyone but themselves anymore (including management).",2,Current Employee,CAPS 2 Associate & Pharmacy Technician ,"Lincoln, NE",2/13/18,2018,2,13
Not a company I'd recommend to work there,"What i had learned working at Walmart was it was a waste of my time. I went above and beyond to get the job done and i wasn't appreciated. I was treated like i didn't matter and the job that i did wasn't important. All that mattered to management was making them look good. Management was rude and disrespectful. Didn't know how to talk to employees. There were employees that had no management skills, no people skills, were very unprofessional and were not team players were made department manager. The benefits may be good but for me it was not worth it (I know friends and family that had worked at Walmart and felt the same way).. I would not recommend working for Walmart to anyone. The only reason I worked there was because i had just moved to North Carolina from Chicago. I didn't know anything or anyone and Walmart was the one store i was familiar with as far as the distance",1,Former Employee,Meat Sales Associate ,"Winston-Salem, NC",2/13/18,2018,2,13

They treat you like a dog!!! No work life balance,"Get prepared to have no life.  Decent pay but it’s not worth the sacrifices you will have to make with your family.  If you are not a internal hire get prepared for the lack of formal training all together, it becomes dog eat dog and no one wants to help you out.  You will have to learn on the fly and will prob never meet the expectations of your store manager who will always want more. Other reviews are exactly right, they want more with less. They will cut your hourly wages and want more with less. Therefore you have to pick up the slack and stay late until job is done. Others are inaccurate, get ready for 14-16 hour days at the minimum, and you will still get treated like garbage and that your life means nothing to them or your store manager. “Your salary now” is the slogan so that means your but belongs to them. It’s honestly a joke. They don’t follow their own policies and don’t respect you at all.  Also get prepared for the daily threat of termination.   Now hourly associates get treated like they are kings and most are lazy as heck but most of the time they are just happy they came to work. Their call out policy is the most lientient I have ever witnessed and they still complain it’s not good enough, remember that’s hourly not salary. As someone else said maybe go in there for a year or two get some experience and get out but if you want my recommendation, run, run hard and run fast. Your life will be better if you never work for this joke of a company. Now i only wish I could find a way to not shop there, but you really can’t beat the prices.

About working at Walmart,"At Walmart the management was great because they worked around my schedule. I loved working there because it was fun and always busy, on holidays it sometimes gets overwhelming because of all the customers trying to buy stuff last minute and at self checkout you have to watch everyone real closely. The hardest part of the job was on black Friday you had to check every customer out at the self-checkouts so they don't change the prices on them or don't scan an item.

Fine entry level job.,"Walmart is a fine entry level job for kids in high school or nice as an in between job. However, the management system is not the best in design. In places of little employment, such as the deli in most Walmarts, management does the bare minimum to make sure things get done, and then scold us for when something doesn't get done right or at all. Overall experience was fine. Nice people to work with, and some nice managers. However, on the other hand, it was rough being the only closer in the deli, which is a 3 man job, for the first 3 months of working there. And for the next 3 year, closing alone was a common occurrence due to the lack of staff and unhelpful management.",3,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Longmont, CO",2/12/18,2018,2,12
Extremely overworked Salaried positions.,"My time with Walmart was basically this;60-70 hours a week in a very large Supercenters over several states with little down time and an ever changing schedule. Upper management (Market, Regional, Divisional) was very threatening about your job security and always presented themselves in a very ""more holy than thou"" type attitude with little to no teaching or training but more of a demeaning outlook.No real appreciation to the true work that was being put in on a daily basis or even a mention of the performance metrics you had improved, even if these were saving the company hundreds of thousand of dollars per year.The real work that it takes to run a 100 million dollar warehouse is very demanding and the Executives and upper management seem to have lost what real talent is or the toll it takes on the people and their family.",1,Former Employee,Co-Manager/Store Manager ,New Mexico,2/12/18,2018,2,12

Productive and growing opportunity,Everyday I had to go first to the podium and pickup the cash for my register. I was assigned to a register to replace another cashier. It was a rush always because that Walmart was very full of customers the most of the time. A lot of customers looked for me because I was very fast at passing and charging there groceries. At night we were assigned to clean the checkouts and registers. Sometimes whenever a cashier from another department such as customer service or money center was needed I went to fill out that associate. Not everybody was able to go to those departments you needed to be very familiar to the policies of the company to serve at those departments. Management was a little difficult sometimes. To call a manager when there was an issue not always they came. The problem had to be notified to them so that maybe they would go. I think that the company needed more managers in the store. They are too few sometimes and even in big events they go crazy because they aren't enough. The hardest part of the job is trying to satisfy a customer and what I loved about the job was that you have the opportunity to learn from different areas and to grow in the company.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Cayey Municipio, PR",2/12/18,2018,2,12

Easy for the managers,Managers often walk around the store and check up on the Associates progress in their area which is not a bad thing but when you work alone with 7 pallets in a below zero freezer you slow down and when your too slow you get written up so managers can easily push you into a corner with too much work and basically force you out the door.

I live about an hour away and have traveled to this job for years now. I have tried to transfer but I always have at least 6 points out of 9.

Great Place to work,"Compensation was fair, the only down side is the work/life balance.

Good place for a part time job.,"My career at Walmart was mostly positive. The work is fun and challenging in good ways, but my career ended with management changes and job expectations were changed without notice. What I was required to do was never stated because I worked an irregular shift from my manager, and I was reprimanded up to termination blindly. Not all employment opportunities at Walmart are like this, but the franchising means it can happen, so be cautious.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Indianapolis, IN",2/11/18,2018,2,11
Had good benefits,"Initially, the position was very oriented to the department that I worked.  As time went by, the company did not hire replacements for each department and required everyone to fill in other departments.  That was not a problem for me until my department started to see a decline in cleanliness.  When we were unable to correct this problem due to lack of personnel and being pulled from our department, we were reprimanded.  I did not feel we should be reprimanded when we were doing triple duty for our department, and other departments.  Management changed 4 times in my time there.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Bradley, IL",2/11/18,2018,2,11
Worked there for 4 years,After 4 years of working on multiple shifts they expect you to have no life outside work they want you to have open availability and to devote you whole life to them with little pay they cut hour to below full time when I have full time status,2,Current Employee,Overnight Associate ,"Macedon, NY",2/11/18,2018,2,11

Challenging and Stressful but mostly stressful,"Work will be fun and exciting at first but it'll eventually start to take a burden on you and become a nightmare. My first few months at Walmart were fun and challenging until a new management and scheduling system messed everything up. There were 6 of us but now only 3 (4 but one covers other departments now). I can work Sun- Thurs any time but only work 4 and half hours, 7 on Sundays and my other coworker only works on Wednesdays! She's been with Walmart for years and has full availability but only works one day? So that leaves me with all the responsibility of keeping my area clean and zoned in under 4 hours , and taking care of customers plus the call for 2028's ( Back up registers). _x000D__x000D_Do not expect any training at all or expect very minimal. I've been working for about half a year and I still haven't been trained to pierced ears.. and some stuff I still don't have training in. Management is also very difficult to get along with or even communicate with, they will get mad for things you don't have control over. ex. shoes becoming a mess after you clock out ( Even though you zoned before leaving) being called out to help with the front registers but not having enough time to finish. _x000D__x000D_Walmart seem to do things that don't make sense, they will fire people for no reason and then be short staff and expect the remaining staff to do everyone's job and keep the store running smoothly. Do not expect them to work with your availability. Either you work full time and any day of the week or don't work at all._x000D__x000D_If you're going to work here, expect your favorite coworkers to quit - more...",2,Current Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,California,2/11/18,2018,2,11

Part time college job in a area that was uncomfortable,The Walmart I worked at was at a dangerous location in Harrisburg PA. In 2008 the third shift job paid well with good breaks. However going to college I had to work part time as a cashier and take a down grade in pay. Due to location the things that occured were too much with full time graphic design college work.

It was a okay place to work,"This is a good place to work for your first part time job, I learned a lot of things about business and the importance of engagement marketing through my training at Walmart.

I don't know exactly why but I couldn't even go in because when I did I would become ill and have to leave work. I quit this job with a month of working there because I had already missed so many days that I knew I would get fired since I was still sick.

Loader Position,"The main part of the job is to load boxes into trailers that are delivered directly to Walmart stores. You will get about one month  of training and then you’re on your own. It’s very fast paced and you can be assigned six lanes to work. To use the restroom, grab a drink of water is almost impossible until break time. Managers will not confront other shift managers about employees not finishing loading their trailers, housekeeping, sending off trailers before their shift ends. What happens is you fall behind from the beginning of the shift and never catch up. A computer tracks your pace and if you don’t move enough freight you get written up. They won’t even call you in the office to sign anything, just write you up. This company doesn’t mess around, a minute late, write up, ask for a bandaid, write up, call in sick, write up.",2,Current Employee,B2 Loader ,"Smyrna, DE",2/10/18,2018,2,10
"stressful, at times overwhelming and boring must be able to keep calm at any situation",Wal-Mart was the hardest place I ever had to work for...not for the job itself I was a cashier but the customers and managers. I spent so much time being told by management to do one thing and as soon as the customer complained about it I was in trouble for doing so. I am sure different jobs there were easier and you were treated better but my management liked to discipline and yell rather than help. You have to understand there is no pleasing most people. I have been yelled at for being to friendly or not enough..bag to slow or to fast or even in the wrong manner to the particular person. They also never followed the eight hour turn around law.

A Day In Walmart,"A typical day at work would be to go in in the morning, work, go on break and drink some coffee. I learned that the customers come first and you can't please everyone. The management had always tried their best but some didn't care to help others succeed. The hardest part of the job was learning how to sway your words to keep others happy, and even though there will always be drama in a work place you shouldn't have to be walking on egg shells all the time.

It was great at first,"It was great at first, but then the demands of the job outweighed the amount of pay. As a salaried member of management, it seemed as though the amount of hours spent there was never enough. There was always a reason you'd get stuck there. And around the holidays, they would take away your days off (either one or both depending). This left very little time for a life outside of work, because by the time you get home, you eat and sleep and go right back.

Local Huntersville Walmart,Walmart in the Huntsville location is poor location to work for. Management is not very supportive or helpful.

We also help stock most of the candy which takes out a big chunk of our day.. The last part of the day we are responsible for setting the truck on the GM side of the building which consists of making sure they have pallets and rocket carts and L carts to start the afternoon process.

I still have a positive opinion of Walmart.,The company is still transforming and evolving.  Management positions demand more results and consistency.  They are also expected to move up and not get complacent.  The culture is still there and Walmart associates are like no other.  The days are long but there is a sense of camaraderie and team work selling hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of merchandise and helping thousands of customers a day buying merchandise at a low and fair price.  It is truly a great place to work but it's what you make it.  Retail is demanding yet satisfying.  This is not for everyone.,4,Former Employee,Co-Manager ,"Tampa Bay, FL",2/9/18,2018,2,9

Beware of managemnet they follow their own policy and not the companys.,On a day to day basis you pretty much had to watch what you said and who you said it to. Working hard in your department wasn't enough they would not show appreciation to their employees.

A great learning experience all around.,"Working for Walmart was an interesting and enjoyable experience. A typical day is helping customers, to go above and beyond their expectations. You learn something new everyday, that is one of the many advantages to working in retail, you never stop learning. Management has its ups and downs, somebody always has to answer to somebody else. I met a lot of people, co-workers and customers that I will never forget. If you enjoy a fast paced work environment and meeting new people this is a great place to work.",4,Former Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Louisburg, NC",2/8/18,2018,2,8
DON'T work for walmart,"i worked there for 4 years. it started out grate and promising. as long as your a good person they will most likely hire you. however the career advancement they preach about is a lie. it only happens if you have a go connection with the managers in charge of the store and if you don't have a good relationship with them they wont promote you. i myself tried several times to get a promotion after months of. coming in early, staying late, taking on extra shift, doing extra projects, training new hires, and doing managerial duties that were far above my position but even after working so hard they didn't so much as give me a chance because i was not there friend. simply put if you want to be professional and a hard worker you better off looking somewhere else because walmart is not a play for hard working smart people. they will make false promises and lead you on to squeeze out as must labor as they can from you then ether try to get you legally terminated or make you hate it so much you resine.",1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart associate ,"Augusta, ME",2/8/18,2018,2,8

I would here and there get an angry customer I would tell them I was sorry and take care of the problem!,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Waterville, ME",2/8/18,2018,2,8
Physically challenging with minimum reward,The work pace and physical demands at Walmart are very stressful and hard.  You will work a minimum of 10 hours per day and most days more than what you are scheduled for.  The pay and benefits are good and that is the only reason I would recommend Walmart Logistics.  You will have a mix between good management and horrible management it just depends on the shift and location.,2,Current Employee,Freight Handler ,"Ottawa, KS",2/8/18,2018,2,8

Worst Place To Work On Retail,"Working at Walmart would not be so bad if there was a cohesive management staff that would listen to their associates and that would communicate with one another.  Our quarterly bonuses are basically stolen from us by our management staff and the associates get blamed for everything.  They use the pay as a source of shutting us up, but pay doesn't mean anything if we are being treated unfairly.  No one listens; Management doesn't care and if they can find a reason to fire you, they will!  It just would be a better place to work if management didn't see the associates as pawns to play with and if they would listen to us.",3,Current Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Roseville, MI",2/8/18,2018,2,8

Highest turn over rate I've ever seen,Hired on during a back to school sale. The overall management was very disorganized with how they communicated with their employees. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job was getting instructions on what to do. I did not remain as a truck unloader and became a sales member. What was concerning above all else was their interviewing and hiring process. This Walmart hired several people at a time every other week.

I mean I come to work in the -20° freezer killing myself for these 15 minute breaks every 3 hours, just so I can get closer and closer to getting fired every week.

The lady in HR had been there for over 5 years, you would think that she had done this at least once in her career with Walmart...needless to say, I was an outsider coming into their community and a way to boot me out was shortly arranged.

Multi-department learning,"Typical day was mellow to start. Stocking merchandise, cleaning the department and answering the phone. I did get to learn electronics, photo and  the cell phone departments. The photo and cell departments were to most interesting and rewarding. You also got to work with the different vendors/ sale reps. Working with so many different associates was great. The management when I worked there was very poor. Most managers were very hands off and unrealistic about certain tasks. Management looked out for management and no one else. The hardest part was working 3 department solo and being asked to cashier up front while being paged  back to your department because no one else knew how to work them, including management.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate & Inventory Clerk ,"San Lorenzo, CA",2/6/18,2018,2,6
Good place to work at.,It was good place to work at great manager and staff. When I need a day off would talk to manager and would get it off very family oriented. Some co-worker thought they were manager. If you had a problem you would go to the manager or supervior and they would act on it very quickly. I learned how to weigh food and price them. They are very strict on hygene of cause cause we were dealing with food. Management always have smile on face even if they having a bad day that is great.,5,Former Employee,Deli Clerk ,"Kissimmee, FL",2/6/18,2018,2,6

It is significant because I heard it from all levels of employees from Upper management to cart-pusher._x000D__x000D_""Wal-Mart is only concerned with the hours you give and the tasks you can complete.

Productive and fun working experience,I have enjoyed my employment with Walmart of the past two and a half years.  My position keeps me busy from the start of the day to the very end.

"Productive, Safe, value-enriched","Walmart is my 1st choice of workplaces I would return to.

"Easy job, but frequently understaffed and overwhelmed","The Deli could be a fun place to work. It is fast paced, so the day goes by pretty quick. The customer service aspect can be enjoyable if you like working with people. If you can handle constant drama, high stress, and inflexible company policies, this might be the job for you.

Walmart: Don't quit your day job!,"As with most jobs, Walmart's management is directed by ""corporate"" and as with any job, employment there depends on how much your willing to deal with, put up with, or disagree/agree with. Now if you're looking for a few hours of employment to get out of the house while your spouse is out being the bread-winner, then Walmart would be an OK place to work because they will not give you anymore hours than what a part time employee can work to keep that employment status, they offer health care coverage at a high price (but what health insurance isn't) without any contribution by the company, and don't expect them to be understanding or sympathetic to your situation or circumstances; they will let you go at a drop of a dime.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Hermiston, OR",2/6/18,2018,2,6

Customer First Program not boding well for employees!!,"I loved working for Walmart until the customer first program started at the beginning of 2018. It is a computer based program that creates the schedules. I am a divorced single mom that has custody of my children every other week. On the weeks I have my children I could only work until 5 pm so I could see them. Before this program started Walmart was willing to work with my certain schedule. But after they told me it was up to the computer and couldn't guarantee those hours. So in a nutshell I put blood, sweat and tears into my employment and then got crapped on.

The management isn't the best because I've had 4 managers since I've worked there but the managers in general were very respectful towards me.

Its a job,"....i liked my job as a lawn and garden associate had some really nice co workers and job itself wasnt bad either. Management is horrible they let power go to their heads and are not considerate of workers, actually that's the whole corporation. Apparently not allowed to make one mistake in the year n a half of employment they fire you for stupid reasons. Even when your work ethic is the best. They rather keep lazy people rather than hard working people. Seen a lot of lazy, horrible work ethic people get too many chances. While its so easy to just get rid of hard working employees who put their all into a job that's not recognized or appreciated. You get more appreciated by coworkers than management.Of course doesn't mean all managers a few( i mean a very few) where really great.

Walmart review,We were production based and were expected to meet the production given weekly. I would say the I learned the accounting aspect of freight.

Welcome to Walmart,"A typical day at Wal-Mart begins with your zones AKA facing the items on the shelves to make them look more full and organized. Then whatever your assigned role may be (mine being Electronics associate) I return back to electronics and do the same thing for the rest of the day. The management is a bit of a mess. Unfair treatment to scapegoating and different rules per manager have proven ungrateful to associates. The most difficult part of the job is having to tolerate management breaking rules and lying about policies. The best part of the job are the associates I work with, not the management. One important note is the sick days or schedule flexibility. I'm currently enrolled in college and working at Wal-Mart can often conflict with your school even after reducing hours. The sick days are very little as well, so you must use them wisely or you can be terminated. I feel Wal-Marts' across the globe aren't the same as the one I work at and I don't think Wal-Mart is terrible, but the store I work at could use some improvements.",3,Current Employee,Electronics sales floor associate ,"Oskaloosa, IA",2/5/18,2018,2,5

Its a nice filler job with no foundation,"A typical day varies, no day is completely the same. Sometimes, a lot of the times there isnt enough workers to run the floor, so you are covering more than one area. You gain knowledge of your surrounding areas because you work there so much. When it comes to managers, while they do try to help, Walmart gives them an overwhelming amount of things to complete so they arent really attentive. You might know more about the company and its functions than the managers who are over you. Most enjoyable part of the job is more than likely the people you work with. If you have a nice and fun atmosphere then you usually have a really great store. Most people who are at walmart stay because of the associates and a constant paycheck not because of the company. The hardest part of the job is working every holiday and not having a set schedule. Also just because you are full time doesnt mean youll get 35-40 hours a week. Sometimes youll be given 16. Also most of the time if you do overtime they cut you before the work week ends.",3,Former Employee,Electronics/Wireless Sales Associate ,"Marietta, GA",2/5/18,2018,2,5

No work life balance. No appreciation but good pay,Walmart was great to me when I first started but when the company was sold a lot of changes effected the workers and theirs lives outside of Walmart.

Hands down one of the best OTR trucking jobs there is.,"Walmart Transportation is overall a great place to work. The salary and the benefits are just about the best you're going to find pulling dry vans. You must live within 250 miles of the D.C. you're applying to. For a single person, this is an excellent job. When you start you will  be working 5 days on and 2 days off in most cases. You will not have an assigned tractor, but they try to keep you in the same tractor for 5 days when possible. You will be working weekends. After you've been there several months you can bid on a program (5/2-5/3, 6/3, or a schedule with an assigned tractor) but someone will be driving your truck when you are at home. As far as the work goes its's pretty straight forward. You touch nothing in the trailer. Pick up a loaded trailer, take it to the store, drop and hook, deadhead back to D.C. There are times when you will pick up backhauls or pallets too. This is a great place to hire on when you are young (if you have enough experience and a clean driving record) get yourself established and settled into a consistent schedule, and retire from here. My personal experience was that the job was too hard on my family life, but that had nothing to do with Walmart.",5,Former Employee,Truck Driver Class A CDL ,"Sealy, TX",2/5/18,2018,2,5

Everything you assume is true,"While Walmart promotes a lot of employee-friendly mindsets and sugarcoats everything, the nitty gritty of the job was that it was menial work and they expect it to get done at robotic speeds. I heard people constantly say around me that it used to be ""like a family"" to work there years prior, and I wish I had seen that, but it was nothing like I experienced. Only reason to apply at all is the company starting wage, but if you don't advance just after your first 6 months it's likely you won't be advanced at all without fighting tooth and nail for a higher level position. An unfortunate truth, but people get lost in the Walmart system being stuck there the rest of their lives.",2,Current Employee,Personal Shopper Associate ,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",2/4/18,2018,2,4

It is what you make of it,"A typical day of work there is a constant routine. You clock in, check your tasks and prepare for the work day or night. While I was working there, I learned about teamwork and how important it is to communicate any concerns or comments to management. Talking about management, it honestly depends on the person it is. Some managers actually showed an interest in learning about how they can make the work day a lot less stressful, and others didn't really care. They were constantly in your face telling you to kill 48 hours of freight in 5 hours. The work hours were also very hectic, one week you worked 40 hours, and the next week you would work only 24. The hardest part of the job was getting past all the constant high school drama that happens in the workplace and securing your position in the workplace. The most enjoyable part though, was meeting your co-workers and establishing a friendship with the right people. Also, the on-the-job training is really good as well.

Kind of biased,I loved working at Walmart. I worked at a training which means they trained for management there. I did not like the managament at the one I worked at they played favorites.

With practice and getting to know your store, helping customers will become second nature as you will know where most of the items not only in the department you are working in are, but as well as where other items in surrounding departments may be located. All in all Walmart is a good company for a starting job. The pay is cosiderably good compared to other retail stores. Management on the other hand, depends on the department you are assigned into or apply for. Some managers are more of a laid back professional whereas they are not as strict about how things are done. Other managers though are very by the book.

Great employer 20 years ago,"Started to work for ""the best"" job in the trucking industry 20 yrs ago. Today, it's not the worst but falling quickly. Company used to care about you, your family, work schedule, salary, and many other things to be sure drivers enjoyed their job. Health insurance is almost unaffordable for benefits we receive.  Simple things like awards and safety cookouts being stopped because of cost has employee morale very low. Getting paid while completing work related tasks (printing your own pay stub, looking up PTO hours, etc), and flexibility in changing work schedules has created drivers who no longer care. Management no longer cares about their drivers, only the bottom dollar. New drivers are starting off at lower salaries and making less.  You can no longer fellowship with other drivers at our DC, because of possibly offending someone, not being politically correct, and all the cameras. Our Safety Mgr. has been seen monitoring drivers by standing on top of the building with binoculars trying to catch you in the act of doing something wrong!_x000D_Can't believe my once, great employer, is no better than the other companies now.",2,Former Employee,Driver ,Georgia,2/3/18,2018,2,3

Management is not very great. You meet a variety of people, but be careful, some people are not very friendly and some are even a bit prejudice to others from certain backgrounds.

It was a joke of a place to work,"I was a horrible place to work, the customers in the location where so greedy and self serving that It truly was a fight everysingle day at work if their perscription had a $2 co-pay. They are used to gettting anything medical free and completley dissrespectful if your tell them anything different. No to mention the employees where cut-throat. Even though you have worked there just as long or longer they tried telling everyone at their lever and below what to do or how to do their job. The cut-throat came in when a Lead Tech position was being buzzed about, there where a couple of people literally trying to get fellow employees that they have worked beside for many years FIRed because they where so insecure they wouldnt be able to compeite with the others. I was a complete and utter joke of a operation.",1,Former Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Sparta, IL",2/2/18,2018,2,2

While working there I saw management come and go so rules was changed up a lot. One of the hardest things I had too deal with while working for Walmart was management due to the pressure that was put on them and taking out on the cashiers wasn't easy but I kept a smile on and didn't let that affect my job.

Became stressful when store manager was having a bad day.,"Previous manager was a great teacher and had patience to let us learn without fear of repercussion.  He managed by doing with us and following up.  New Store Manager was condescending and patronizing.  With her immediate supervisor she took all good credit and shifted blame out to others if a process was not executed.  I had several associates who wanted me to approach her with ideas, questions or requests. I was already on the outs with her so another 'dumb request or question was just another day for me.",2,Current Employee,Co Manager ,California,2/2/18,2018,2,2

"Great company, poor management.","Walmart is an interesting place to work. By and large the average associates there are amazing people who work hard each and every day. _x000D_The company has heavily invested in systems and processes that help organize and streamline the work each associate does and helps with providing much better customer service, so kudos for that._x000D__x000D_The management structure is simple but constantly changing and the managers who get promoted past the assistant manager level are typically the type who don't care about their associates as people. _x000D_The few assistants or Co-Managers who do care try hard to balance their compassion and their job responsibilities and truly deserve more credit for what they do, but sadly are rarely rewarded. _x000D_The work/home balance is non-existent. Schedules are written 3 weeks in advance and you will work when they want you to work, end of story.

Co-workers are great; management is disorganized,"I love the people I work with. They are all caring and understanding. They work hard. The problem is management, specifically upper management. They are so disconnected with their workers that they do not seem to understand how things can or cannot function. The store manager is not concerned with this issue as long as it does not affect his bonus. Another issue is upward mobility, or rather the lack thereof. They do not want hard workers in management; they want someone they can control without question. They will create a ""management"" position with little incentive or benefits, give it to someone, and then eliminate that position within a year and a half to keep up with costs.  _x000D__x000D_This job is great for college kids, but terrible to get stuck in.",2,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Johnson City, TN",2/2/18,2018,2,2

Stay out of retail.,"Walmart is a great place if you don't want anything in life. They will pay you better than many retail chains, but still not great. They try to automate as much as possible, so be ready to use seemingly outdated computers to get jobs done. When I was there, they were rolling out computers to track your current task completion, which was annoying and inaccurate at the time. I haven't been there in years now, but judging by the fact that all my previous managers have either stepped down or quit, and that my old coworkers saying I got out at the right time... I'm not looking to go back to that.",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Cottonwood, AZ",2/2/18,2018,2,2

It was alright,For the money you can't complain but they could use better management....upper management was a nightmare.

Okay place to work but the management is terrible,Work day consisting of stocking shelves with as much freight that could go out as fast as you could.  Help any customers or employees that need help.  The management was terrible.  They seemed to not know or can't remember what its like to not be a manager and it goes to their heads.

"Great company, poorly managed single store","Wal-Mart as a whole is a great company. I would recommend anyone to work for Wal-Mart. With one exception. The store in Fort Morgan Colorado. It is poorly managed. I routinely witnessed episodes of poor judgements at best, and the most underhanded examples of nepotism at worst. The store is kept at about half the staff needed for a store it's size. Managers who are promoted to be the boss to their significant others. Creating a small town "" Anti-outsider"" feel to it.

Just a job,"If upper management worked together customer issues would have been lot smoother and easier to handle. Seemed management would contradict what we were taught or each other so it made for some sticky situations between the employee and the customer. The work was ok, they made sure we had lots of training. The schedule could be crazy sometimes unless you worked n a department where you had a set schedule. Depending on your department manager and co-workers, it could be fun at times. The owners of  Walmart .company need to be ashamed of how the employees are treated and taken advantage of as a whole. Not a bad job but not a good job either. Had it's good and bad days especially dealing with customers. Seems that Walmart customers can be mean and cranky most of the time so that in itself was challenging but you the nice and pleasant customers made things even out so you just focused on the positive till your shift ended.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Ocean Springs, MS",2/2/18,2018,2,2

"Working at this establishment was, challenging to say the least.","The ""open door"" policy that they seemed to pride themselves on does not exist. The company would rather fund their higher up associates then care two seconds for the lower employees such as the cashiers, over night stokers etc. They only offer the pay raises to employees who have finished their pathways which are impossible to complete do to the fact that you are not ever allowed to go into the back to complete them because you are swamped with customers at all times. Then you are not allowed to complete them on your lunch breaks because you are not allowed to do any work related activity off the clock. So the company is literally scamming their own employees just so that they can keep them underpaid, and less taken care of.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Joplin, MO",2/2/18,2018,2,2

Busy days around Layaway,"Around Christmas time there was layaway. I had changed my position to cite-to-store. Cite-to-store was managing layaway. I learned how to bin boxes, make sure stuff was organized so when customers came they had everything they purchased, memorized where all bins were so when a customer came to pick up I would know exactly where I'm going. Management would help out every time it got crowded and busy. Always gave reports on how everybody was doing and gave us our rating every week. Everybody gave a good vibe because when one was stuck was always another to help out that person. Hardest part of the job is making sure you got everything that customer needs an not have them wait a long period of time. Have to make sure the customer leaves happy an willing to come shop again. That was the enjoyable part of the job, knowing that customer got what they needed an left willing to come shop with Walmart again.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bolingbrook, IL",2/1/18,2018,2,1

Fast paced,"A typical day at work includes unloading a truck with approximately 2,000 pieces on it. You take the pieces that come down a line and put them in their designated areas. Once that is completed it is almost break time because it takes two hours or more to get this task done. Next, The carts of grocery are taken out to the floor to be stocked. The supervisor keeps two people in the receiving room to break down the freight that comes off of the next truck on pallets. We take the grocery from these pallets and sort them on carts to be ran to the store floor later in the evening. After our second break we pull all of the freight that came off of the first truck and place it in its designated area of the floor to be stocked by the night shift. I have not learned much from this job because it is just a basic retail job. I don't see much of the retail side because I am in the back doing physical work. I also feel I do not learn much because my managers are younger than me and are very immature. The workplace culture is not great because the people I work with all seem to have a sense of entitlement, and I do not like that in people. The hardest part of the job is probably breaking down the freight that comes off of the second truck because I am always chosen to throw the grocery. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting a paycheck because this is just another job like this that I have had to do to help get me through school.",3,Current Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Linton, IN",2/1/18,2018,2,1

I came off third shift and started working on days as a stocker in the frozen/dairy section. I really love both positions for different reasons.

A Great learning experience,"I enjoyed the store but the Distribution Center was a little much. I worked on average about 18 to 20 hour days and extra days outside my schedule. I learned a lot the work experience was great but the expectations were unrealistic.

productivity and growth,I can recall m typical work day as stress ful at times the supervisor was unprepared and spoke unprofessionally . they did not care whether customers heard you being addressed in that fashion. You had to walk on eggshells because you never knew which supervisor would be snapping at you. the assistant managers were less than compassionate when a complaint was made about a supervisor. management stuck together against the associate. If you were not liked your chances for promotion would be very unlikely. Your ability to get the job done was not what mainly mattered. Who liked you and your character determined your climb up the corporate ladder. The hardest part of my job was to get all the chiefs on one accord so I could fully accomplish my work for the day. Too many chiefs speaking at the same time.  What I learned to cope was to confirm what I was assigned and begin doing it as soon as I could.

The hardest part of the job was throwing a truck, the low item count trucks where the easiest, then getting 3000+ item trucks took two hours of consecutive throwing.

Need to boost productivity! Few hard workers with too many laxed employees.,The meat departments productivity and efficiency all depends on the people working in it.

You have great benefits and managers are generally pretty understanding. Once you've been with the company for over a year or two though you start to see the issues within the company. Walmart as a whole company is incredible, but it seems management at a store level lacks to take action when problems arise and don't really listen to their employees problems.

Terrible management,"I am not one to bash my previous employers but the managers showed favoritism to certain associates and new positions were only offered to those that were ""friends"" of management or bought lunch for the managers.

It's Walmart,"I was lucky to have an amazing manager during my time at Walmart. If I knew all stores had a direct manager like her, I would rate them higher, but they don't. It seems any more managment doesn't care about anything out side of their next bonus, and how to make as many people below them do all the work possible. Very rarely do you find a manger that is willing to work beside you and encourage you to go above and beyond.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Poplar Bluff, MO",1/30/18,2018,1,30
Company with experience in employee care,"I loved going in to see my coworkers every day, just me and a bunch of girl friends having some fun while we completed our tasks for the day. I did end up switching to another location and I do have to say that it really depends on who you work with, also the fact that when I switched, they changed their programs and my schedule wasn't working, resulting in a very difficult time since the managers of the new location didn't communicate with me. However, I did enjoy the pay and the ability to work at my own pace. They accept everyone without any bias against race, religion, sexuality, disability, etc. which felt really great too.",4,Former Employee,"Sales Floor Apparel Associate, Centerville ","Orem, UT",1/30/18,2018,1,30

Fast-paced and unorganized,You are constantly busy and running around so the job was never boring. The managers gave me a brief description of my job and sent me on the floor with little knowledge of what to do and what not to do. The store was overall unorganized and little communication between managers and other workers out on the floor. However they provided great benefits and the co-workers in my department were very helpful and friendly.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pflugerville, TX",1/30/18,2018,1,30

Not my favorite,"It was my first job, so my body had to break into what it felt like to work 40 hrs a week. The bad thing is that I was hired part time seasonal, but they worked me full time. They did this so they didn't have to give benefits out. That place practically traumatized me from ever working at Walmart again, but it was also probably considered the worst Walmart in the country, so much so that the CEOs of Walmart paid 2 surprised visits to make sure the store was in shape. The morning shift had tons of managers, not that many stockers, and then when there was overflow in the stockroom, night shift got blamed for it, and the managers admitted that the store was way understaffed, and was allowed to hire during the holidays. I go back into Walmart, and I see night shift working, and I feel for them, I really do. You can see the look in their eyes, they do not enjoy one bit of it.",2,Former Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Raleigh, NC",1/29/18,2018,1,29

Company doesn't care about you!,"When working for Walmart, you get treated like dirt by the customers, management and other employees. Everyone one there talks down to you.

Great job depending on enviroment of work place you are in,Never know what you can expect when working with Wal-Mart. Plans as expected as thing will be easier along the day. Assign task and follow up accordingly. Management is skeptical at times but everyone has a family to feed. Workplace depending on associate moral can vary. Hardest part of job is not knowing what to expect throughout the day.,4,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Goldsboro, NC",1/29/18,2018,1,29
Its not that great,Working at Walmart is ok as long as no-one is harassing you. They say that they have zero tolerance for any kind of harassment but when you report it they make you look like the bad guy,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Monticello, NY",1/29/18,2018,1,29

"Productive, fun and ever changing atmosphere.","I have spent the last 10 years as a manager for Walmart. It is truly the associates that have made this company what it is today.

Overall,"Walmart is a large busy retail store, if you plan to stay long and work hard you can make it up the ladders with this company. If you work as employees in the store there isnt any paid vacations. only good to stay with them if you plan on heading that career path.

Horrible,"Wouldn't allow overtime, cut hours drastically and couldn't care less about how you or your family are. I had Strep and they wouldn't excuse my absence even with a doctors not because I didn't have pto to cover it.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Spokane, WA",1/29/18,2018,1,29
make good money but not entirely worth it for everything you put up with,"Some jobs have a certain way of doing things......""one best way"". Ours gets missed up soon as we clock in. There's never MC40s (which is needed to do our jobs), but higher management will not buckle down and make people turn them in so the next shift can use them. Then management will have you work on something else instead of sticking to the policy of ""one best way"". In the end of all this, the big problem is later on they'll want to know why you didn't get your processes done. Then you have to remind them they wanted something else done first, or you didn't have a MC40. So it's either do your process first (like your suppose to according to home office) and get in trouble cause you didn't get the special stuff management wanted first. Or forget process and do what management wanted then you're still in trouble. We have several ""managers"" and each one thinks their request is more important than the others, which causes a problem. They don't communicate to each other, so they don't know what all is already going on. While you're trying to do one thing for a manager, then the other comes up then you're in trouble cause you're not working on theirs. I'll admit with all the chaos and non-organization, I would really miss a lot of the people I work with and some of the customers I've grown to know.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Jacksboro, TN",1/29/18,2018,1,29
Decent Place to work for,"The culture in Walmart is very customer based. The best managers do not stay with Walmart long because they transfer to better companies.

Advancement,Overall it was a good company to work for. I went in and worked my heart out for the first 3 years and was promoted to a higher level of management and then after 18 months in position i was told that the company was going to do a restructure and my position was being eliminated.

Stressful,All management have nasty attitudes from the moment you meet them. Expected to do job without training. Expected to do CDL training on time and also regular work. You get in trouble for doing exactly what the the management told you do. Every manager has different style and pet peeves that tick them off. You also get in trouble for having overtime even though management or supervisor asks you to stay pass your full time hours.,2,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Willow Grove, PA",1/29/18,2018,1,29

learning experiences only at WalMart in the cashier job,Walmart is generally a stressful place to work and shop because of its overwhelming popularity for buying anything in its industrial-size space that causes many tired shoppers to be fussy at cashiers.

Changing times,"Walmart was a great company at one time.  Every year that goes by they continue to expect you to do more with less.  Yes, the company has streamlined many processes to make jobs more efficient, but you can only squeeze so much juice out of a lemon.  The culture is spiraling downward as the past couple years hourly associates were given crumbs for raises.  Everyone received the same amount, so associates who worked harder than others saw no extra reward.  Every time minimum wage is increased, it only affects associates that are brand new to the company.  So associates that have been with the company 3 years end up making the same as someone off the streets.  Walmart never wants to talk about all of these inequalities and they expect store management to not talk about it either.  Sam Walton cared about making money AND taking care of his associates.  Those times have come and gone.",3,Current Employee,Complex Store Shift Mgr ,"Forest Park, IL",1/29/18,2018,1,29

You never know what your day is going to be like, depends on the mood of the store manager or if associates call in, customer flow, etc etc.  I have worked in several stores and i can truly tell you that the mood of the store manager sets the mood for the store.  If they are ticked off the whole store is just a mess of nerves and tears and if they are having a good day the store is amazing and the amount of things that can get done when people are happy and just buzzing around is truly amazing. I wish higher management would remember that when something is missed or a mistake happens that it does not help to just fly off the handle and start throwing a fit.  Just pick up the pieces see what the break down was and fix it calmly. Walmart has a great culture that really includes anyone that wants to be a part of it. Hardest part i think is that you can never expect what will happen from one minute to the next, you can plan out your whole day, week, and month but you never get to complete your plan because things come up or more important things always seem to have to be done right now. Communication seems to be an issue through out the company. This seems to be better from home office over the last couple years but still difficult for it to trickle down to the associates. I love the people, customers and associates they are great and the best learning tool out there. I have always learned things from my associates - more...",3,Current Employee,Management ,IA,1/28/18,2018,1,28

typical productive day at Walmart,"While working for this corporation i was semi satisfied with everything about this place but as you begin to work week after week you finally adapt to the work environment. You begin to realize that the assistant managers will try to utilize your position and take you for granted and they will try to convince you that your job could be in jeopardy if you fail to do them an unnecessary favor which they would call a task. Example : its 11:07 7 minutes after your shift ends and you have completed everything you have to do and your about to clock out then your assistant manager comes and abruptly commands you to bring a cart to a specific department for other employees that just started they're shift so they do have to do that.

Interesting and often stressful workplace with inconsistent management skills,"Working for Walmart is not as bad as many others may say, but it is also not a perfect place to work. On a daily basis, we associates have a set of roles we are expected to take on, which can vary from completing a zone (organizing a section or department), stocking, or unloading a truck (which we do in the CAP Team). However, while we may have a set of duties to complete, we are often told to go outside of our ""normal"" position to complete those of someone else's, which often causes a conflict between supervisors and managers of different departments (one manager may tell an associate not in his or her department to do something the associate's manager did not tell him or her to do, for instance). Overall, despite the stress that often comes with working for Walmart, I have found it to be often fun to work here, as every day brings something new, and it is a great opportunity to build communication and leadership skills while collaborating with fellow associates and helping customers in need.",3,Current Employee,CAP Team/Backroom Associate ,"Shorewood, IL",1/26/18,2018,1,26

Good starter job,"I applied for a part time cashier job which is what I wanted at the time. I was placed in jewelry and working part time-some days some nights. I was asked to take a department and promotion. I decided I was up for the challenge and accepted. I was intrigued with the idea of a set daily schedule. I loved the work I did but I was seldom allowed time to do my daily work. I was required to ignore the schedule, work either overnights or 5 to 2 shifts to straighten up every department and cover for other managers on vacation. I had at least 5 supervisors telling me to do 5 different things at the same time and the constraints of the schedule and time clock prevented me from ever getting projects completed on time which frustrated me.  The atmosphere of backstabbing, complaining and lying that prevailed made it difficult to know who to trust or even speak to. My part time job turned into my life style as I was spending more of my waking hours at work than at home. For a person just starting out, this would be a great job-plenty of room for advancement if you can take the pressures. I was not looking for a full time career change so the job ended up being more frustration than I needed in my life.

Working at Walmart was basic , it was what i like to call mediocre. Typical work day consisted of stocking shelves and cleaning up after yourself, other employers were friendly but mostly we all kept to our self's considering we had a basic time limit to our area of work. I liked management because they were very understanding even when i had to leave unexpectedly. The hardest part of my job was the fact that I'm short and there were plenty of high places that took extra time to grab a ladder and place stock which would slow me down.

Borderline Abusive,"This company is regularly cited for having poor management and an inconsiderate culture, so I will primarily leave that alone. The biggest problem with this company is the inconsistency in promotions. The company regularly gives promotions to people simply because they threaten to quit. This is not an exaggeration. One of the corporate measures for a store is the employee turnover, and because of this good employees are often taken advantage of and given nothing while mediocre employees are handed promotions. The pay is also unreasonable. It is far beyond common to have 10 year employees making the same amount as people that just got hired. Raises are annual, but the amount is negligible at best.",2,Former Employee,Sporting Goods Department Manager ,"Carrollton, GA",1/24/18,2018,1,24

Wal-Mart can be an alright place to work depending on your supervisors and managers but it is not a good place for a long term position.,"the beginning of my shift was the most enjoyable part of my job. I liked coming in to see how much work I had to get done and planning out how I was going to get it all done. I learned that no matter how much work there is, there is always a way to get things done. Management had a tendency to only only pick on certain people (never me.) I saw them pick favorites and give special treatment to those they picked as favorites. Even though I was one of the favorites I always expressed how I didn't think it was fair. The hardest part of the job was the end of the night was the end of the night when I was done processing merchandise off of the truck and had to go out to the sales floor to help stock.

Easy Jobs,I didn't give Walmart 5 stars mainly because of management.  There are at least 5 different tiers of management working at the store at the same time which means communication is horrible.  The jobs are typically easy and not so stressful and they give you a lot of hours plus over-time when available. Human Resources will help fit in school and any other jobs you may have so they can be very flexible with that in mind.The environment reminded me of high school at some times.

Wal-Mart,"Worked at wal-mart for almost three years. It was a rough job but I enjoyed every minute of my time with them. Yes, management sometimes was very pushy but I pushed back in the same manner, especially if I knew what I was doing and all worked out for the best. The only thing I am unhappy with is how I was relieved of my position with them. They don't tell associates much about the attendance policy except that if you go over a certain number of days they are forced to fire you.

"Okay Job, Not the Best, but Not the Worst","Working at Walmart was okay. I worked overnight (10pm to 7 am) and let me tell you... there's hardly any work/life balance because that shift leaves you drained! And on top of it being a long overnight shift, you're on your feet the entire time besides your breaks and lunches. Breaks and lunches were fair, but it sucked having to wait for a manager to tell you when to go. I worked hard consistently and most customers loved me (except for the rude ones of course) and practically all of the managers loved me to so they were fair when letting us go for breaks and lunches. Pay at the time (2014 - 2015) was like $8.75 for overnight I think. It definitely could've been better. After working as a cashier for a while I was moved to zoning and stocking inventory in the cosmetics department a lot. It was pretty fun and relaxed as I was able to do my own thing as long as my pallets were cleared by morning. I wasn't considered full time so there weren't any benefits other than the 10% discount. It's a pretty basic job, not really difficult other than dealing with the long lines as a cashier and handling heavy boxes as a stocker.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Beaumont, TX",1/23/18,2018,1,23

Other employees in my department work together with me to complete our daily tasks. The most difficult part of my job is when there is not enough associates on the floor to handle the traffic of customers. Because we also have to fix,m activate, refill their phones and other devices, if there is not enough people, customers are not satisfied. Also, sometimes the products they get are out of our control to fix so we have to call other companies for help, but if they are not willing to help us, we are stuck in the middle figuring things out.  _x000D__x000D_What I enjoy the most about my job is when everytime I am able to figure out a solution for my customer, it makes me feel very useful and happy.",4,Current Employee,Electronic Sale Associate ,"Live Oak, FL",1/23/18,2018,1,23

Lack of Knowledge in Management,"While trying to run multiple departments we were never able to complete our daily tasks due to management constantly pushing other work on myself and the associates.

It can a great job,"For 8 years, it was a fun, fast-paced and challenging place to work. But in the last year, more responsibilities have been placed on each associate as staffing diminished. Such that it became impossible to complete all tasks assigned in a manner that would satisfy management. This lead to  management inconsistencies. On one hand, you are told you are going a great job, then a day later asking you about your poor job performance. Always while trying sound like they have done everything they can to help you succeed, but not seeming to understand that they have assigned more than can physically be done in eight hours.  Most dept managers are taking anxiety meds due to workplace stress.

A typical day at work for me was usually filled with online orders, and/or customers coming in for their purchases or help with it. We had many phone calls throughout the day which kept us busy during the down time. If we weren't receiving phone calls, then we were returning the phone calls for expired merchandise still being held at the store. The hardest part of the job for me would be locating merchandise that is no longer in the home spot where its suppose to be. Meaning you would have to check the TC70 or MC40, returns, claims, backroom, bins, and anywhere else the merchandise could be if the on hand reported it to be in the store.

It's where you go to get cheap stuff and that is all._x000D__x000D_The culture is Every Day Low Prices which is derived from Every Day Low Costs.  Walmart Home Office performs complex calculations to determine how it can cut costs down to the bare minimum in order to maximize profits.  Included in that calculation is the scheduling, treatment, and wages of employees (aka ""Associates"").  Non-salaried employees are set up to be part-time employees programmatically.  The system caps their hours at 32 hours and in order for the employee to be bumped up to a 40-hour work week, a salaried member of management must either temporarily override the 32 hours, or make a permanent adjustment.  Salaried employees are expected to work more than 40 hours a week (which really means that for their wage they are performing a full-time job in addition to a part-time job, which isn't very bright)._x000D__x000D_Walmart treats its ""Associates"" poorly.  The key factor in Walmart's persistent public image problem is in the way they treat their employees.  In some industries there is a metric for most key aptitudes the company values (e.g., Customer Satisfaction, Business Knowledge, and Employee Satisfaction).  Walmart lacks these metrics when evaluating management.  It does not care about Employee Satisfaction.  And this is truly one of its downfalls.

Productive work environment in which to stay occupied,Wal-Mart is a very productive work place in which there is always a job to be finished whether it be large or small. Management is polite and professional towards customers. Management duties can be questionable and hypocritical at times. A typical day is busy in the morning and towards closing while in the evening it is a steady flow of vehicles enough to stay on your toes or until the rush of vehicles arrive. At the end of the day duties that must be done are done. Other associates can be very unprofessional at times and can cause issues among others in the work place causing a disturbance. I enjoyed working with the kind customers and kind employees. working on new vehicles or vehicles that you would not expect to see being serviced at Wal-Mart.I learned that for things to be done properly at times you must take charge of your own accord and finish the assignment when others are too unmotivated to do so. The hardest part of the job is when the other employees choose not to work and continuously go to smoke when there is only 2 - 15min. smoking breaks; when there are lines of customer vehicles waiting to be serviced and there is only 1 technician in the shop. hours being cut for part time associates so they are unable to apply for full time positions is frustrating. Also when a single co-manager is given control over associates hours after doing the same action at a different store and failing is disappointing. After completing all the vehicles before closing and cleaning up the shop; knowing all the vehicles that have been finished and on time there is a sense of accomplishment. - more...,3,Current Employee,TIRE LUBE EXPRESS TECHNICIAN/SERVICE WRITER ,"San Tan Valley, AZ",1/22/18,2018,1,22
