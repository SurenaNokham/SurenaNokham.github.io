Terribly Managed!,"They treat there employees awful! Lack of organization and inexperienced management.  They make promises and dont follow through.  They make up procedure and policy on the fly and do not properly inform the employee.  Then they will ""write you up.""  They yell at grown adults as if they were 5 years old.  Management hires unreliable people, because they are unreliable... It appears when they have hard working, loyal people, the take advantage.  Again, management is inexperienced and un professional!

Horrible,"As a receiving associate it was my job to empty out merchandise and other products from a truck.

No regards to veteran employees. Overall, it is a horrible working environment.",1,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Virginia Beach, VA",9/3/15,2015,9,3
Face paced work place but enjoyable,"Everyday was a different scene, new faces, and new issues. the management is great and the customer service is great! the hardest part of the job is the hours , they are long. but the easiest and most enjoyable part is the interaction with people and of course the pay check at the end of the pay period!",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rogers, AR",9/3/15,2015,9,3

Wal-Mart Distribution Center,"Pretty good job, if you can make your production quota. It takes time, it's hard to work up to.

its a good job for extrra cash,I guess it depends on which Walmart because they are all different. I've worked at the Grimes and WIndsor Heights locations. My favorite one is the one in Grimes.

At the Windsor Heights I feel like im just helping out In each department.,4,Former Employee,Shay- Supervisor ,"Grimes, IA",9/3/15,2015,9,3
Surprising decent company to work for aside from poor management.,"Upper level management sets unrealistic goals, and will ride you if you cannot accomplish those goals. They are never around when you need them. They do not do their job. I have been the Department Manager for 6 weeks and still have not gotten my raise, because they avoid me at all costs, and send assistant managers to do their dirty work. Overall, the work itself is not so bad, but the management is horrible.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Cambridge, MN",9/3/15,2015,9,3

My Career,In the beginning it was a company that was for the associates and customers. Now it all about money. How can a person pay their bills on 28 hours a week. If you take off for being sick or your family you get points against you. Assistant Management works unbelievable amount of hours,3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Philadelphia, MS",9/3/15,2015,9,3
what else can i say,The pay is not good and the nights were quite long. i unloaded trucks and only got paid at that time 6.25 in aout 3 months i received 60 cent raise. If it wasnt for the unloaders how would the product reach the floor.,2,Former Employee,Unloaded and loaded GM freight ,Greenville Texas,9/3/15,2015,9,3
Fast work.,"A typical was always busy, you got to learn the difference in people . Management was always willing to make anything easy for you as long as you helped them as well.

My job,Managers would listen but not follow thru with what they where saying if an issue came up. I learned more responsibility being there and how to handle stuff on my own. I had a few co workers who would really help me and respect me where as others not so much. Hardest part of my job was management and disrespectful co workers. I loved getting to work on cakes and create a master piece that customers loved.,3,Former Employee,Dept. Manager ,"Moore, OK",9/2/15,2015,9,2
Not much good to say,"Walmart is a really great place to work... if you are a member of management. Other than that then it's not worth it. How can I afford to live on 1, maybe 2 days in 2 weeks? I am one of the hardest working people I know (not trying to brag) and yet walmart doesn't recognize that an reward me with more hours. Instead it seems like they give me fewer and fewer hours!",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Live Oak, FL",9/2/15,2015,9,2
Flexible scheduling,"I have worked at two different walmart locations and have found that management varies greatly depending on the store. My newest store has a more open management style with the store manager and assistant managers knowing every employee. At my last store I would have been surprised if even 1/3 of the management team knew me by name. The opportunity for advancement is available at walmart and they offer many free learning opportunities, including college, ged training, and learning foreign languages that will allow the company to meet customers needs.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Associate ,"Boothwyn, PA",9/2/15,2015,9,2

walmart,"walmart was an alright place to work. though there was one person of management who unfortunately did  not like me despite the fact i was nothing but nice to them. i worked the night shift then. what i didnt like about my job was that they gave you a certain amout of time to do things. the way i see it, not every one can move at the speed of light. then there was the fact that they said i was putting things in the wrong place when i was puting them in the right place because i made sure the price tags matched before putting things in place.",5,Former Employee,stocker ,"Wasilla, AK",9/2/15,2015,9,2

At this time, I am not getting good hours so I am looking for another job.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Adamsville, AL",9/2/15,2015,9,2
Pay very well but you kill yourself,"High pay rate.. 12 hr days on your feet running around. Production levels are very high and hard to make. People get fired all the time. High turn over rate. Not for older people unless your fast and have no knee or back issues. Management has favorites like most places. Because of the high production requirements, everyone is for themselves for the most part. Walmart is a charitable company and will give you a chance. Its very difficult to keep your job though.",3,Current Employee,FID ,"Raymond, NH",9/2/15,2015,9,2

A wonderful place to work and to retire.,"Walmart DC is a very productive and great place to work. I work 12 hours a day Saturday,Sunday and Monday. I learned how to do things more efficently and in order. My co workers are great and very respectful.

This was honestly the worst place i have ever worked at in my life,"I hated being a cashier at Walmart. When you tried asking the management for help or even simply said hi, they would give you the worst attitude, and begin yelling at you just because their day was bad. I would understand that every once in a while because I have my rough days too. But this was every. single. day. I would ask them for a roll of quarters and they'd immediately start yelling at me for no reason what-so-ever.I had a miserable time working here and I will never work at a large corporate retail store like that ever again.",1,Former Employee,cashier/sales associate ,"Woodbury, NJ",9/2/15,2015,9,2

Needs to see employees and Humans,"After 31/2 years of work there I can say that the pay is not getting better at 40 cents a year raises, no matter how good your work review. Plus they seem to only give promotions to people who are young and have no disabilities.  I like the people because we are all in this together, and even most management people are good. The company sucks, schedules are all over the place (2-10 Friday -back at 7 am Sat) and never any guaranteed hours per paycheck. There's never enough people to do the work properly and give good customer service, and hours are getting cut again. It's sad because this could be a great place to work if the company would give people full time and better wages.",3,Current Employee,sales associate ,"San Antonio, Tx",9/2/15,2015,9,2

There is generally plenty of training, although they are known to ""throw someone in"" to a job they may not be ready for. Most of management is willing to help with any questions, usually.

"No life balance, dictatorship, poor treatment","I worked 10 years for this company, if you don't drink the cool-aid, you get treated badly.  The pay was poor, even for working overnights.  Wal-Mart has shown time and time again they could pay their employees more.  I traveled to help other Wal-Marts in the area, they were all structured the same, and treatment was poor in all of them.  8 hour shift, 12-18 hours of work in task manager, penalized for not completing the work.  I worked maintenance, or at least I tried to, they would just pull maintenance workers to help them stock and let the quality of the store go to waste, this is a theme in most Wal-Marts.  The sick policy gets abused so people can actually get time off, you also don't get to use your sick pay for the first day you miss, but you can for the next two, encouraging you to use your sick time  for the next two since you were being docked an absence anyway.  Poor environment, most managers don't have a clue, overnight managers run the place with an iron fist.

WalMart Logistics,I worked for WalMart for 20 years. I started working there when the work rate of pay was $4.00. I held many positions through out the years. Asset Protection Area Manager was a great job. I learned it so much that I became the trainer for new managers that were hired and would go to other stores in our district to help out. I was offered a job in Logistics doing basically the same thing except it was for groceries instead of retail. The training was intense and was on my own with the assistance of an employee in that area for that day. During my probationary period I made a procedural mistake and I was let go. I use it as a training tool. I shop at WalMart and I still look for things that need to be corrected.

Wrong turn,"Co workers were good, for the most part management was too, except for a few. Great teaching on how to run the business from a to z.

You can manage a tire shop like you do a bake shop.......terrible idea.",4,Former Employee,TLE Manager ,"McComb, Hattiesburg, Laurel, Wiggins, Columbia, MS",8/31/15,2015,8,31
terrible,"It was an all around nightmare.

"A good part-time job, but not a good job to build a career.",A typical day at work is maintaining patience with bad customers and bad co-workers. I learned a lot about how retail works and I learned a lot about other departments other than electronics. The management team is not a productive one. They only create problems instead of solving them. They're setting up the store to fail. Most of my co-workers are not hard working. They are more concerned with goofing off and chatting on their smartphones and with each other rather than actually getting work done. The hardest part of my job is maintaining my cool in a bad workplace. The most enjoyable part of my job is an hour long lunch break.,3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Lansing, IL",8/31/15,2015,8,31

difficult company,"I was part of the over night crew.  A typical night involved time task and we had to work at a very fast pace.  The coworkers were difficult to get along with and appeared to lack any real interpersonal skills.  They were often related and dating management.

A good lesson on humanity,"I usually worked as a sales representative for Electronics, Photo, and Connection Center. I ended up operating as an acting manager without the title, and was responsible for all 3 areas with little staff assistance. The lessons I gained from this job are essentially patience for customers, coworkers/supervisors, empathy with them dealing with highly difficult people and sympathy for their struggles. The managers varied from awful dictators, to indifferent, to push-overs. Overall the most difficult part was trying to manage a large workload when coworkers didn't want to be there and management didn't want to provide direction. However that allowed one of the best parts of the job which was being able to learn how to run things fluidly myself.",3,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Orange, CA",8/31/15,2015,8,31
Workplace had friendly employees but very little supervising.,"Walmart was a rather busy place to work at, considering I was a cashier, I had to interact with the customer at all times, and that wasn't bad at all.

Nice break room where we can watch movies on our breaks,"A typical at work, first I police the parking lot then make sure the cooler is filled with water bottles. What I learned from my job is that you can't depend on no but yourself, management are very critical when it comes to things they want done a certain way.

Each day was a little different and when I left I could see where what I did that day made the area neater, cleaner, and better for the customer. Cashiering is not the job for me however, and with some internal restructuring that wouldn't work with my life requirements, I had to go back to being a cashier and thus facilitated a need for me to look for something more fulfilling. I enjoyed customer interaction, stocking, maintaining a neat and clean work area, rotating the product to ensure freshness and keeping it relevant to the shopper.

Assistant Manager,"Walmart as a company is a good company. They want to invest in their associates. This on a whole is true, however you can have a vastly different experience depending on what store you work at.  The store I worked at was extremely understaffed when I arrived and still is over 6 months later.  We are told to hire but not given time to do so.  Because of the staffing issue, management is doing a lot of physical labor.  This in itself is not a problem but it becomes one when the amount of that labor far exceeds the time required to do the management tasks.  I end up having to stay 3 or 4 hours late each day or come in on my off day to catch up on work I am not allowed to do any other time.",2,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Alexandria, LA",8/27/15,2015,8,27

I hated working here,They overload you with more work than you can accomplish in one day. Management is afraid to get their own hands dirty. Very few actually pulled their own weight.

I enjoy the number of breaks that I get throughout the day especially coming from restaurant business where the breaks you get are simply the down time when it is slow. My co-workers are friendly and happy to help me with questions. The only issue I really have is that the management team does not enforce policy equally. Some managers let certain scenarios happen while others prevent that scenario and let other scenarios happen. If policies were enforced the same way throughout the entire management team it would be a much better operation.,4,Current Employee,Walmart Cshier ,"Richmond, Kentucky",8/27/15,2015,8,27

The hardest part of the job was relying on my co-workers to finish their duties before their shift ended. The most enjoyable was being around electronics and in an environment where I was completely comfortable from the start. I did not need to ask questions because I was already so knowledgeable about electronics.",5,Former Employee,Electronic Sales Associate ,"Lacy-Lakeview, TX",8/27/15,2015,8,27

Benefits to Everything,"Having worked both store level and Home Office, each very different in character, I can highly recommend the Home Office for those interested in personal and business growth.  Corporate jobs offer invaluable training, opportunities for improvement beyond most employers, and a wide variety of promotional options and diverse paths. If, however, you are more interested in getting paid than self-improvement and promotion, store level employment is enough.  Store wages are comparable to other local businesses, but be prepared to work for the money. Management, like people, is different everywhere, so if the environment is what you want, just try another store.",5,Current Employee,IMS Associate ,"Lynn Haven, FL",8/26/15,2015,8,26
Associates are wonderful to work with. I love my job!,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is filled with multi tasking and fast paced environment. One of my favorite parts of the job is the many hats I wear. At any moment I am a mentor, a counselor, a coach, a teacher, a motivator, a expert in LOA and FMLA, the benefits teacher, the lead instructor for the various computer based learning programs for associates, and the guru of employee engagement. I am the secretary, the equipment repair person for the phones, fax and copy machines. I am the liason between the Salaried Assistant Managers, and the associates. _x000D__x000D_I prepare and promote employee engagement, the cancer walk, and the Childrens Miracle Network program. I plan cook outs and outings to let the associates know just how much we appreciate all they do and their involvement. _x000D__x000D_Then there is the daily paper work, employee onboarding, evaluations, terminations, and employee engagement surveys. The personnel department in a Wal-Mart is a busy place with plenty of goings on at all times of the day. At Wal-Mart one of the most frustrating parts is that the HR Manager position is hourly and confined to a 40 hour work week. That is extremely difficult when you are putting over 50 people through in a week time by yourself. It is also rewarding and challenging. The support that is received by the associates, their appreciation for the assistance and counseling always fills my cup. _x000D__x000D_Integrity, privacy, and confidentiality has always been in the forefront of my position.

Its Okay,"The salary appropriately reflected my position at deli. Unsurprising, there was a decent flow of business at my station and being fast paced meant body ache and stress. Management style varied depending on circulated leader. Some were more lenient and sociable than others and it was either you loved you liked or disliked who you had. There were normal job politics and a little more drama than needed for a student balancing work/school.

Over the years I managed to communicate with main managers and was able to find the perfect solution of working only weekends while in school.The hardest part was standing for long periods of time between potty breaks. I enjoyed making customers happy and making them laugh. A typical day in the life as a cashier would be to clock in go find a CSM and they would assign you a register to go work at.

The co-workers make the time go by faster and depending on their work ethic, can make your job less of a hassle. The hardest part of the job is to stay out of the way of management while trying to do your job correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and interacting with them.

Full time associates get some good benefits. The every three month bonus is nice and helpful when we meet our mark. The hardest part of the job is when we are pulled for other things hindering us from finishing our tasks. Ex: Working in Apparel then getting pulled for register or to do a piercing. It is great to learn as much as you can for you will always be needed, but the more you know the more you're pulled for things. The most enjoyable part is the face of a happy customer once you have helped them find what they were looking for.

Stocking items on shelves,"My job at Walmart was to stock shelves with items for customers to find and buy them.  Stocking the shelves was hard work, tedious, and exhausting.  This was the hardest part of the job due to manuel labor and not having a home for the items without a place on the shelf.  Some upcs do not match the item that's suppose to be placed there and some shelves do not have upcs at all for the items.  I've had rude associates yell at me and one at least being mean to me by yelling at me for putting something is his kart.  Management's not that much better either because they just pile the work on you and expect you to get it all done which was horrific.  I did learn how to become an overnight stalker and it was fun at first but then I began hating the job.  The hours I started hating too because I was working from night to day eight hour shift and the give you a whole pallet to work on by yourself which did not happen at the beginning.  I had help with the pallets before but towards the end of the beginning they start scheduling you to work pallets by yourself which I greatly hated and still hate the idea to this day.  The only wonderful part of this job were the nice associates.  They talk with you and are friendly towards you.  I would not want to go back to Walmart to work for any reason; not even to be a cashier.  It's a terrible working environment and some people are just mean, jerks and I do not want to go back there.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Woodbridge, VA",8/25/15,2015,8,25

I learned how to pull freight from the truck and sort it by departments and even pull the freight out once in a while. I learned how to handle hazmat products and how to take care and dispose of them._x000D_Managers and co-workers lets talk about those. Everyone i worked with had a fantastic personality other then a few sour apples but i never let them bother me. Everything didn't always run smoothly with the managers, one side knew what was going on while the other had no idea which makes situations a bit chaotic.

A good place to work,"A typical day in the pharmacy at the Ozark, AR Walmart is normally a fun experience. Everyone that I work with is friendly and does their job well. The management that I have directly over me is great and I always enjoy seeing them. As you go higher into the management chain, however, is where you start to see the faults in that system for us that are lower down.

A Stepping Stone on the Path to  Something Better,"A typical day at work for me often meant receiving instructions from a manager who was too busy in the back office to understand what was happening on the sales floor. I learned quickly that management has no appreciation for self-motivated individuals, and, quite frequently, they feel the need  to micro-manage those who have a clear understanding of the day-to-day necessities of their jobs. In fact, I was reprimanded more than once for doing a job that I saw needed to be done because my manager said that it wasn't in my job description. My co-workers were wonderful, for the most part, though there were a few who did not follow policies who seemed to be shoe-ins for promotions. The hardest part of my job was walking in to the store everyday for almost eight years knowing that, no matter what I did, my management team would find some silly thing that I wasn't doing to their satisfaction-- even if it was an improvement from past discussions about my job performance. It was also difficult to train not just one but three people to take promotions that I was qualified for and had applied for but not received. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping my customers to find what they were looking for.",2,Former Employee,CASHIER ,WA,8/22/15,2015,8,22

A positive attitude and acceptance for change goes far here.,Walmart is a enormous company with lots of red tape and politics. With 300 employees you'll always see fresh faces and new managers. Because of the high turn over rate the people being promoted struggle to learn all of their responsibilities and are tense with pressure to succeed or be replaced. The training on the job is done with multiple choice computer quizzes with the hands on experience being taught by the other associates and not by management. _x000D_The policies frequently changed as does the directions and priorities. Many different levels of management with the same goals and different strategies to meet them.  The company goes over sales daily and chant Walmart with the staff to include and motivate them.  _x000D_ All in all if you have a strong work ethic and a good attitude you can move up the ranks pretty easily as most the employees there don't. There are tons of positions to choose from giving you an opportunity to gain lots of experience doing different things. The company gave good bonuses and incentives. Good medical insurance and great dental.,3,Former Employee,Merchandise supervisor ,"Happy Valley, OR",8/22/15,2015,8,22

Awful,"Never, never, never, never work at Wal-Mart. They raised the minimum pay yes, however they lowered the annual raises you get maybe 10-15 cents if you do a good job. If they think you aren't good they can deny you raises. Management is terrible. They give you a 10 hour task and expect you done in 5 to get zoned and go help other people who don't do their job. The people who do their job get in trouble because they expect them to get everything done then when they have an off day they don't have a back up plan for then like they do for the employees that normally don't get finished.",1,Former Employee,Dry Grocery Gm Stocker ,"Dayton, TN",8/21/15,2015,8,21

Most of them are very nice. The co-workers are also very nice. I enjoy working with them. The management team is easy to work with. They will do what you need them to do if it is within policy. What I have learned over the years is that you have to be okay with change. This company changes things a lot; which is okay with me. The hardest part of my job is trying to get credit cards. We have to ask customers if they would like to apply for a Walmart credit card. The most enjoyable part of my job is working the Money Center.

Great opportunities but poor scheduling,"Wal-Mart has great opportunities, however the way that their schedules are set up is concerning, especially for the CSM. Sometimes their isn't any coverage and if your the closing CSM you have to open 5 sometimes 6:30 in the morning, I'm concerned because I'm only getting four hours of sleep. I love my position and what I do, but the hours running together like it does is wearing me down and when you talk to management about it the say well, you have to do what you have to do.

"Great labor saving processes in place, but don't follow them","On first look, Wal-mart is a wonderful place to work. The processes are designed to keep work flow & inventory flow running smoothly. We stock shelves based on capacities, make display pretty, & work occasionally with customers in the night shift. In reality, management doesn't enforce the processes set in place, so it's a never-ending cycle of overstuffing shelves resulting in tricking automated re-order processes into re-ordering, setting up a snowball effect of automatic over-stock while management pushes us to get the stock any way we can onto the shelves to sell. This resulted in mountains of ""feature items"", stressful workplace, & a whole lot of unnecessarily harder work. The hardest part of this job, besides physical, is knowing there's great automated processes in place, & that by working against it, it has created a monstrous & stressful cycle of putting out fires, & learning I'm not allowed to do a thing to bring things back in line. Some management expressed same frustration. I did enjoy working with customers & some of my co-workers. It was nice seeing Wal-mart does give some people down of their luck, a chance at a new start. Don't know if CEO has any idea impact work-practices vs automated processes has on the lower efficiency of the whole business, or just won't see it to make appropriate changes.",2,Former Employee,Night stocker ,"Lakeside, CO",8/20/15,2015,8,20
Overall not bad place to work of what I can remember,"Learned how to due PNL for quarterly and yearly, cleared all invoicing and claims, ordered, price changes, put items on file that were not in system, merchandised and cross merchandised for better profitability.

Good and Bad,"A typical work day at Wal-Mart would almost always be an eight hour period, rarely would there be a seven hour day or a nine hour day. Wal-Mart required you if you're working 8+ hours, you needed the one hour lunch break and two additional fifteen minute breaks, if less than eight hours- a half hour lunch break. and two separate fifteen minute breaks. I worked in the Fitting Room - which my day consisted of answering store calls, transferring calls, keeping ears on the walkie-talkie and reaching people over the intercom. In the fitting room you also have to tend to the people who need in the fitting rooms, as well as taking two or three trips to Customer Service to keep up with your returns, which in your case you have to tag/re-tag and sort the returns into Jewelry Department, Infants, Childrens, Womens, and Mens clothing. This job taught me how to multitask very effectively and manage my time - and keep a fast pace. Once or twice a week, although, management would not answer back to the fitting room even if we used both the walkie-talkie and intercom to reach someone. During those times, callers would sometimes wait for management to answer for up to twenty minutes at times. Most of the time the fitting room would have all returns completed and rarely would it not. I considered all of my co-workers very hardworking people, especially those who trained me and worked with me every day. I had learned each of their life-stories and the reason why they worked in the fitting room.

My management team was great and very supportive. We spent a lot of time laughing as we worked. Occasionally when someone would call out or the store was short staffed, I had the opportunity to be trained and practice on register. The most difficult part of the job was the heat. I spent about 95% of my time outside on the asphalt in the parking lot throughout the summer months.

Management was very friendly and they were very enforcing about getting the job done,"A typical work day for me would begin right after school, around 4:00. From the moment I arrived in the parking lot, my fellow employees would greet me with a smile, and they would inform me of the current situation that we would have to conquer that day. For example, they would tell me how busy the day had been, or if the management had requested anything specifically such as keeping the children carts in the bay area for that day. The CSM's would check on how were were doing, and if they noticed anything that they believed should be taken care of first, they would let us know to do that first. They always approached with a smile, and ask how we were before sending us to do a task. They remained very friendly at all times, and were only assertive when needed. My coworkers never complained about their job, they only complained about the weather or if they had a problem that they needed help with. I believe the hardest part of the job was to keep a quick pace at all times, while keeping an eye out for a customer that needed assistance. At times it would be very hectic, due to a rush of people at a certain time, so we had to avoid the traffic while pushing a line of carts. The most enjoyable part of the job was the care that everyone showed.

After that daily reports we're run and analyzed. Worked with the cash office on long and shorts, also visited with the inventory associate. And above anything else the safety of our customers came first.

"Fast paced, easy, fun workplace.","Walmart was an enjoyable place to work with amazing co workers and customers.

"Stressful, and often overlooked","I've been in the Electronics department of my store since February of 2014. I started as an unloader the year prior in June, and my co-workers at the time celebrated me moving to the floor as the ""first unloader to escape the backroom,"" which was funny. The first month, however, it seemed every day I was pulled to unload the truck, which was rather annoying to me, but I understood that we needed the help, and went with it, but eventually told management that I have to do what my job code is, and I can't learn if I keep getting pulled to unload._x000D__x000D_After that, it was as it should be: stressful, yet rewarding, and full of new things. I was in the Army, so I had some leadership qualities, and I knew that I had to think on my feet in spur of the moment situations, and I knew I was doing well because management actually started to notice me. Eventually, I began learning several different areas of the sales floor, and by others' amazement, I was able to do many a task after being shown once or twice. Example, I never knew how to cut a key or mix paint. After watching one of the paint counter workers do it once, I was able to match the paint and mix it with no trouble. _x000D__x000D_During my time in Electronics, I've had the chance to move up to the supervisor position. I've taken the supervisor test and qualified, and went into each interview. From what my management team said, I was the best interviewee they've heard in each one. However, due to favoritism (or in my opinion at least), each time I was only second-best.

nice way to meet new people and use communication skills,Co-workers are easy to work with and overall the job is okay on a typical day at work. Management is easy to get along with. I enjoy meeting new people and talking to customers that come through the registers. The hardest part with the job is standing all day long in one area.

Being able to take customers to items or products they where looking for.  Hardest part of my job was being the only member of my crew that stocked shelves when manager was on vacation.  Most of the Auto Care Center Techs refused to stock merchandise.

"Assigned one area, work every other.","Walmart, a place who keeps alot of people working when they lose another job. Your hours are set, don't go over them, else management gets annoyed with you. Benefits were good and all, but took a while to kick in, especially when your were inbetween jobs, and needing the healthcare sooner than later. Assigned produce, I worked every other area more than I did my own. Insufficient coverage placement wise, leads to working in an unfamiliar area. Some parts of the store do things differently, keep this in stock here, while not there.

Working for retail was always nice but it seemed cold.,"A typical day at Walmart was me coming in, punching in and dropping off my coat/purse, grabbing a quick coffee and walking to my registering podium. There I would read where I was stationed for that day and made note of my lunch hour. I spent the first two - four hours of my day checking out customers, cleaning my conveyor belt, straightening up my area, and putting ""stored food"" away. By ""stored food"" I mean of course people who decide ""I don't need this bacon"" or whatever cold food they don't want and shove it deep into the can machine where you can grab a pop if you're thirsty in line before you pay for it._x000D__x000D_I've learned that Walmart as a whole could stand to work harder to achieve that ""family"" orientation that they try to make it seem like they know so well._x000D__x000D_Management was always... distant, no one ever seemed to try and get to know you personally.

When everyone else is on lunch and you're stuck with 10 customers giving you the death stare because you're ""not moving fast enough"" for them or when you're in charge of self checkout and the people don't understand that if you scan alcohol I'm going to ask you for an I.D. if you don't look 40! If you don't look like you could be my mother or father then I am going to I.D. you no matter what.

Be True to who you are and always do your best.,"This has been a good company in the past, however the company has really changed over the last few years. The Work Life Balance in the area I live in does not exist, sometimes it feels that the company has lost its focus on the customer as facilities react to prepare for company rather then the customer that they see everyday. I learned that above all and through all situations be honest and keep your integrity intact. Throughout my day in directing my management team my expectations were high and they always strive to meet them, however being in the building with them I was aware of obstacles that interfere with them meeting my expectations all the time. We had a saying that if we reach for the sky then if we miss the mark we hit the clouds and not the ground. The hardest part was not being allowed to do what I was hired for and that is be a store for the community and run my building.  Each level that enters a store gives notes of what they want or how they think it needs to be, not taking into consideration the team that is there day in and day out and talking to them as if their opinions matter. I say that not for me but for my team. I always listen to their ideas, most of them live or have lived in the community so who better to get input from. I enjoy my team and my associates, they did a great job changing the perception of our facility and making it a place people wanted to shop and work.",2,Current Employee,Store Manager ,Alabama,8/12/15,2015,8,12

"Large retail company, leader in retail","Growing with this company was a valuable experience that I am lucky to have received in my career.  I started as a department manager and worked my way to a salary member of  management with over 360 employees assigned to this store.  The salary is very good for this position.  The schedule set are fair, unfortunately I did not get to take advantage of this schedule because I always worked on my days off.   This company needs to work on upper management personnel skills.  I have found that the higher someone gets into the company the more they forget where they come from.  This is bad for business and  makes it hard for the ones who do care to get things done and to keep a good staff.  Overall I enjoyed the customer's and the staff.  You always get that one group that is all best friends and keep morale alive and the store interesting.  I would recommend for anyone that is just getting started to try and work their way up and stay with the company for 20+ years.  It is a great career job.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Fairbanks, AK",8/9/15,2015,8,9
Should get Management all on Same Page,A problem that I experience while working here was that it seemed to me that each assistant manager had their own way of doing things and no two were alike.  What one manager would tell you about accomplishing a task would differ from the next.  There was very little consistency.,3,Former Employee,Sales Floor and Department Manager ,"San Antonio, TX",8/9/15,2015,8,9
Wal-Mart,It's Walmart so I am sure you've heard enough horror stories.  _x000D__x000D_Management is usually inept and more angry to be there than  you.

Loads of things to learn,"Loads of things to learn about merchandise. What behaviors work well with the customer, general distance that work with interaction. besides all the things to learn that are very helpful at other retail chains, the down sides are the hours being controlled by Corp. the constant cutting of your benefits, depending on your time in depends if your looked at as a positive to the budget or a negative effect. The Staff in general was hard working, management didn't in most times know if they were coming or going due to the massive hours dumped on them. If your attempting college this is by far not a place to be since your going to get a massive shortage on your hours for trying to advance your life into other fields, Your education outside of Walmart/ management is looked at a burden to the company instead of a benefit.",3,Former Employee,Team Leader\Maintenance ,Defunaik Springs fl,8/9/15,2015,8,9
Productive yet very strenuous work environment,A typical day at work included checking the products in the Dairy section and re-stocking products in the freezer and the dairy section based on customer consumption and expiration dates of the products (known as trade-offs). The work environment also consisted of heavy lifting and labeling prices. I learned the values of customer satisfaction although most of my work consisted of heavy lifting. Management at times seemed very uncaring as most of the supervision was done by direct supervisors. Co-workers were often very friendly and there was frequent interaction among them. The hardest part of the job consisted of breaking down the pallets in order to stock more products. The most enjoyable part were the breaks we received.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"North Charleston, SC",8/9/15,2015,8,9

Upper management was sometimes difficult to work with. I love the people I work with; they are like family to me. They do cut hours a lot.

Able to move up quickly,"Typical day of work at Walmart was pretty easy, we would go in clock in and once the truck arrived we would pick a department on the line and we had to check each box that went thru. If the number matched your department you would start building a pile for it. Once the truck was empty we would then start pulling all of the merchandise to the sales floor and placed it where it belong. If we finished early we would get assign a department and help the overnight crew placing the items in the shelves. Everybody worked so hard there was never a time you had to pick up someones else slack. If one day someone called out our supervisor would even go in the trucks and help offload them. I don't think there was anything hard about the job. Everybody helped each other.

Not so happy Place,"This is a new thing for Walmart, when we first started working we were working for a sub contracting company then walmart decided to take over. Things went down hill from there. Walmart is not a place that is family friendly, the management looks out only for themselves. We see patients that have chronic illnesses and when we give them a Dr excuse we get backlash from management, when that should never happen, and there is patient confidentiality so there is no need to discuss what was given to the patient. If it was a doc outside of walmart would they have called to that Doc office to tell them about that Dr note. It is very political here, and there are only a handful of management that care about the associates, If you see a walmart employee unhappy that's because they really are.

Past 2 years was a mixed bag,"Walmart was an ""okay"" place to work at in general; however, my experience working at my local store was admittedly pretty awful. I worked in Overnight Maintenance at my local Walmart, and I would say that I enjoyed in for the most part. The daily routine for tasks would be to sweep and mop the floor, clean the restrooms, bring in the carts from outside, use the scrubber to shine the floor, and basically any other task management could toss on us at random. Helping the customers was the best part of the job, it broke up the daily routine, as well as also giving me a sense of pride to continue helping others. _x000D__x000D_Management didn't hold the same ideals as I did, and can be seen acting rudely towards them when they ask them a simple question. Most of the negative things that came from working at Walmart was mostly because of management, believe in or not. I recall management sending me outside alone when it was four degrees out there to bring in carts, though it wasn't the worst thing they had done to me. I've injured myself quite the few times working at that location, my back, for example, has not properly healed since I injured it working in the snow at the beginning of 2014. What's notable about management there is that they cause a lot of the issues that you go to them to fix, and instead of helping you solve the problem, they'll shrug you off for someone else to deal with. Only once out of the 2 years that I had worked there was I ever helped, and it wasn't by the usual group of co-managers and assistant managers, but by one of higher authority. _x000D__x000D_There was once an associate - more...",2,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance ,10001 Southpoint Parkway,8/9/15,2015,8,9

working at walmart,My typical day at work was always busy. Thursdays and Fridays were the most fun. We would have id say at least 100 customers. I lerarned how to handle money and pay bills. the best part of my job was my co workers. I did not like the company as a whole and felt like workers were taken advantage of. I met my husband there. He was asked numerous times to work off the clock to avoid over time. My felow co workers were amazing i mmade some very meaningfull friendships there. I felt i was treated very poorly while i was pregnant and while other parts of management did nothing when i came to them about my conserns Kelly a front end supervisor really helped and worked with me and my issues that came with my pregnancy.

better than most no education jobs but still barely able to get by with the salary,Work hours are different every day so it is hard to plan routines.

Then there never enough people to cover the shift so you got to work five times as hard because the shift needs 10 to 12 people and the most u get is 6 on a good day and 3 or 4 on the worst.,2,Former Employee,Lead overnight stocker ,"North Tonawanda, NY",8/8/15,2015,8,8
"Wal mart is a decent place to work, especally if you like to conversate","Working here has helped me develop communication skills, customer service, also self discipline. Typical days at Walmart include helping customers at all times, anything a customer needs we will provide. Management is like any other typical work place they manage the work environment but they will help you if you ask them to, or if you cannot satisfy a customer's needs they will find a way to make that customer happy. My co-workers are awsome they will help with any project if you need them, also my co-workers keep me happy while I am working hard even if its a pretty rough day. The hardest part of the job is to deal with a customer who refuses to be satisfied under any circumstances. The most enjoyable part of a work day at Walmart is seeing the smile on customer's faces as you help them find what they need.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Warner Robins, GA",8/8/15,2015,8,8

Difficult to advance. Offers good benefits. Not the most efficient company or stores.,"I've been employed with Walmart Stores Inc. for 3 years and 5 months. I've enjoyed my time there for the most part. I've made good friends there. However the time for change is well overdue._x000D__x000D_A typical day at Walmart: consists of reviewing my inventory (what's on the sales floor, how many product outs there are, what is available in the backroom for stocking the shelves and bike rack). I promptly pull whatever freight necessary to assemble and fill the bike rack as to prevent revenue loss (assembling is the vast majority of my day). I also/often am asked to help in other areas of the store (working freight from the backroom to the sales floor, unloading the daily truck, and securing display items to ensure customer safety, and occasionally running out to the parking lot to collect carts when cart pushers don't show up)._x000D__x000D_I've learned: how a retailer operates. _x000D__x000D_How sales are affected by various things (theft or ""shrink"", featured products, placement of products, and types of products sold during correct seasons)._x000D__x000D_How to be customer oriented._x000D__x000D_How to deal with people._x000D__x000D_How to work hard._x000D__x000D_How to go the extra mile._x000D__x000D_How to be a team player._x000D__x000D_And how to get things done when there is no team available (which is most of the time)._x000D__x000D_Management: Leaves something to be desired in many ways.

Great people to work with,I liked all the employees that I was able to work with but most of the time I felt as if the management that was there wasn't very concerned with anything other than there jobs.

Mentally draining and best if its temporary,"If the job is temporary its fine but anything long term will feel like its sucking the life out of you. Out of the entire store there was only one manager that i had the upmost respect for who happened to be my supervisor for most of my carrier there, everyone else carried on as if they were a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. I personally witnessed other managers attempting to collaborate firing employees that they didn't care for on a personal level. The hardest part is being evaluated by a supervisor who knows nothing about your department or even what you do on a day to day and they're able to determine what kind of raise you get. Gossip is really bad in this company amongst the co workers even some managers, there is a no tolerance policy but that has yet to be effective.

Changing,Company is changing its managers too often. It no longer is a pleasant place to work.Once you have been for a few years you no longer get raises. They have a salary cap.

Was fun and educational..,"Wal-Mart was a very fast paced and educational job. It taught me a lot about working in a retail environment and what to expect when shopping at other retail outlets. A day at Wal-Mart can make or break you for retail-oriented jobs as far as the customer base and the employee base. The customer base has a tendency to range the entire scope of what you expect to see in a retail store and some you don't expect to see. I learned to hope for the best and expect the worst daily, because patience is your best friend when working in one of the biggest corporate retail chains in the United States and world. The coworkers are jovial and fun to be around, but tend to be a little on the lazy side when it comes to following their job description. The management tends to turn the other cheek and sometimes even ignore situations, like the one that led me to leave them. I would have to say that the hardest part, in general, was the customer base and the spontaneity of change in personality between customers. More specifically, they tend to range from the nicest and most compassionate, to the rudest and most vulgar people on earth. The hardest part of the job also does tend to be the most enjoyable as well, since I work with some of the kindest and most compassionate people on the planet and they tend to be very understanding when things that occasionally go wrong, do. In conclusion, this company does have a bad rapport, but that bad rapport is the minority in a world of people who have shopped at this company for 20+ years and have nothing but good things to say about them. Every job has its - more...",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Colorado Springs, CO",8/6/15,2015,8,6

The store ZMS ""zone merchandise mangers"" and store mangers where immature and really didn't know how do do there job, working there felt more like a high school ""click"" rather than a work place.

Theres always something new to learn at walmart,Day to day work had a lot to do with customers helping looking for items or telling them about how some things are to be use in a proper manner. Most days also as a claims associate i work with open and damage items if was damage i had to gather up a bunch of damage items that belong in the same department and add all into a box which will be scanned and ready to be ship back to Walmart warehouse. I learned so much from helping customers and helping the best way possible as i can other then that i learned how to use a telxon which you can make orders and counting items on the sales floor and so much more. I can say that the management was far with the employees they will do anything to help us out from work hours helping customers and teaching us some new things to do while at work. one of my best part of the job is making sure that i got the job done on time and did a good job i love to make my supervisor happy by doing my job right. My co-workers were awesome so manny people and you can learn so much from one another its was always teamwork and that made all of us a lot closer like a family.

"This review is Specific to the Muskego Supercenter, all Walmarts/Retail experieinces differ...","I worked as a Overnight Stocker at the Muskego Walmart in Wisconsin, which is a 24 Hour store. _x000D__x000D_A typical day as a stocker is far better than most companies, in particular it is far better than that of a Grocery store would be. This is partly due to being open 24 hours you need to be able to help guests when needed as well as good staffing policy/location. _x000D__x000D_A urban/rural store might differ greatly, but the team was well staffed and the management was more reasonable and relaxed than any other place I've worked.

pharmacy technician,"A typical days at work would be starting the day filling prescriptions that were called in over night before we open. Answering phone calls from patients and calling physicians was a big part of the job. You may also need to call an insurance company to see why the medication was not covered. I would say that almost half of a typical day at work is spent on the phone. Another big part of the job is helping the customers. Whether it be to find something over the counter or helping them with their prescriptions, customers always came first. I would say that I learned more than I thought I would. I learned how to make customers happy when they were furious about an issue they had. I also learned that working as a team is crucial in many circumstances. I enjoyed most of my co-workers. When i started there, they were all very helpful and very hard working. I knew i could count on them for just about anything. The hardest part of the job would be controlling frustration. Every day there would be a customer who wasn't happy, whether it was because of us or their insurance. They would occasionally yell and call names that were uncalled for. Learning to just get over it was difficult at first, but now it's simply an every day thing. You cant please everyone, but I certainly try. Sometimes you need to kill them with kindness. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and my co-workers. It ended up being a home away from home.

not good,My experience at Walmart was horrible. If you weren't a favorite you would not be treated with respect. Time off and holidays were only given to friends of managers even if you requested it ahead of time. Managers wrote people up unfairly and it was not organized at all.

A Great Job for College Students,"A typical day at work is clocking in, and doing whatever your manager tells you what to do. The majority of management here has not been very helpful, which is why a typical day is just being told what to do. They don't do much, at least not on the sales floor. Customers can be friendly, but they can also be extremely rude. If you are just looking for a job to make some money, Walmart is tolerable. If you're actually looking for a job to enjoy, I wouldn't suggest it. The hardest part of the job is trying to help customers find items they want, but they don't know what they're called. When a customer wants something that doesn't even exist, and then gets angry when you can't find this imaginary project, things can get frustrating. The most enjoyable part of the job is enjoying who you work with. Walmart is a big store, so of course, there are a lot of employees.

I believe this was due to the continuous changes in management. I had the best co-workers.

I have found management and co-workers to be very helpful and friendly.  I find that the most difficult part of the job is being on my feet for an 8-hour shift.  The job requires that you are constantly moving, returning items to the proper display.  The part of the job I enjoy the most is interacting with customers who are always happy to engage in brief conversations.  I particularly enjoy small children and the elderly.

Working at Walmart,"Working at Walmart is not as easy as you think. I've used to go through so much just to get the day by smoother. I've learned that I have a gift that is not really rare in other people. I have the gift that can make any stranger open up to me and tell me their life story. Just in a matter of minutes I can cheer anyone up. I mainly focused on my job, so I'd never really have made close friends with any of the co-workers. Just hi how are you type conversation. They were friendly. Management was horrible. They say that they care for you in Walmart when in reality that's a horrible lie. The most enjoyable part of my job was making people smile.

However, the management was flakey and people were being fired left and right. Mostly for really dumb things. People who have been there forever were being fired for being a few minutes late.  This made me very upset because I knew they were doing this to hire younger people they could start out with less pay.

Things were so piled up that you could not get to the merchandise that you needed for your department. I did not feel safe coming out of the store at nighttime after 9:00 pm.

"Good Friends, Not Good Managers","I have worked for Wal-Mart for a couple of years now, and I can say that my first day on the job was the highlight of my career with them. Over the course of years, there was a lot of turnover. Most of my friends leaving or left, and a lot of good managers replaced with idiots. At the beginning, job was hard, a lot was expected out of you but once you got the hang of it you really start to notice that the managers have nothing better to do but throw their own work onto your shoulders. Managing your space, your work, and your area is simple, handling your space and your work doubled-up by your manager who simply does not want to do their work is insanely stressful. On the flip side of the workload, it does take a good 4-5 months for Wal-Mart to notice you did anything wrong, and put you in the spotlight to tell you how badly you messed up 200 some odd days ago.",2,Current Employee,"People Greeter, Cashier, Customer Serv ","Columbia, MO",7/28/15,2015,7,28

Just the typical big-corporation job,"This job is amazing compared to fast-food, but the management definitely takes advantage of the employees. The company can be very stingy.  For example, they do not pay you for overtime (even if they ask you to stay over).  If you work overtime to finish your task, you will have to take that amount of time off by taking a longer lunch the next day.  You can really get in trouble if you do not make sure to take the over time off of your schedule.  Also, hours have been cut drastically, especially after the raise.  My bi-weekly checks have gone from 70 hours to 53 hours in less than a month.  We are lucky if we get 33 hours a week. We used to be able to pick up open shifts, but managers have become very picky on what we can and cannot do. My pay has gone down so much I'm looking for a second job. They don't really work with your schedule, either (even if you have kids to take care of).  There is also no set schedule.  You might work from 5pm-9pm one day, then 6am-11am the next.  Honestly, the only good thing about the job is that you do have an opportunity to completely switch departments.  I didn't like being a cashier, so they switched me to fabrics and crafts.

Co-workers always do something funny to make me laugh but I'll laugh and continue to do my work. I learned that WalMart can be a career for those that don't any other choice and to have fun while I'm at work. Make the best of it. Management was good, I can't really complain about them at all. Co-workers were just co-workers. They worked just like I did, only a selective few wasn't a good asset to the job but overall, the co-workers were good people to work with. There wasn't really anything hard about the job except finding the location for the items but once I got that down packed, it became easy for me.

A decent place to work.,"I come in and I complete my daily tasks then I examine the store and see what else may require my direct attention. I have learned patience and humility since working for this company. Management is also pretty decent but I feel they could work on their communication towards each other and their associates. My co-workers are mostly helpful and pleasant and we truly do operate as a team when the correct channels of communication are followed. The hardest part of the job for me is wanting to come in to work because even though we are capable of being a great team, communication seldom exists and there is very little structure. In spite of all of this, a smile is put on my face every time I help someone and I might have improved the quality of their day.",3,Current Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Hawthorne, CA",7/27/15,2015,7,27

Unfortunately it can sometimes be a daily occurrence, and often times can be the same customers.The most enjoyable part of my job is the regular customers I've come to have. I have one imparticular who has really made an impact on me and I look forward to seeing her every Friday and Saturday I work. She works for a local group home and will often have large orders and one of the group home members with her.

Department Store Job,My job at Walmart was the least enjoyable job. I couldn't enjoy working there due to all of the corruption on the job.

At the same time management does nothing to change these problems.,2,Former Employee,Deli Team Member ,"Arlington, TX",7/27/15,2015,7,27
Working at Wal-Mart,"The day starts at 4 p.m. setting pallets out to put product on for different departments that is taken off the truck. Management was good. As long as we did our work and got it finished on time they left us alone. The hardest part of the job was being the one inside the trailer throwing due to the heat of summer. What I liked the most was I got into a lot better shape during my time as an unloader. My co-workers were generally good. The only problem was when a good friend (in different department) of two of the unloaders, came to the back room. They always slowed down or stopped taking product of the rollers to be sorted.",4,Former Employee,Unloader ,"Miles City, MT",7/27/15,2015,7,27

A day in Wally world,The job was OK as far as meeting really good people. The only downside was poor management and on-going favoritism. If you weren't in good with management it was extremely difficult for you to advance. They also didn't take your continuing of you education seriously. A college once came to have a brief discussion about continuing education during our store meeting. Our assistant manager rushed them along and stated that we had a job to do. They  seem as if they rather you work minimum wage for the rest of your life than live a happy successful life.,2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Charlotte, NC",7/27/15,2015,7,27
A Good Starting Point,"If you work hard and avoid interacting with all the managers, you will do well.  The more you interact with management, the worse your time with Walmart will be.  _x000D__x000D_However, if you're a quiet or shy person, this is a wonderful place to get some serious training in dealing with people.  Interacting with customers alone is incredible.  You will meet the worst of the worst, and you will meet the most kindest and sincere people you've ever encountered in your life.  This is a great first job for someone, but as far as working here for 30 years, it will catch up with you because dealing with management is an inevitability.

Walmart Life,I was an overnight cashier for my whole entire pregnancy. Managers were very good to me when I got to the point of not lifting heavier things. I felt as if I had a family and still do.

(For this to happen you also have to learn how to bin because this is not a skill set you have to learn as one) once thats taken care of typically it takes likes an hour or two sometimes more depending on how terrible of a job someone else has done in your departments bins and you having to re-arrange everything to make your merchandise fit. _x000D__x000D_Finish binning then you go to first break/lunch or both (depending if you've been binning for more than 3 hours) take your paid 15 then go to your un-paid hour.

Notorious,"Walmart is Notorious for it's workplace practices-underpaying employees and even contracting with companies outside of the country which pay employees substandard wages. The company when headed by Sam Walton had a culture of ""Servant Leadership"" which should be adopted by all companies in America.

It felt like everyone you worked with was your family!,"Wal-Mart had the greatest employees a person could work with. There was not too much room for advancement at all in certain stores. I worked there for almost ten years at two different locations. Management did not do their responsibilities which made your job tough, and everyone that was moved up on the ladder stayed there and nobody that wanted to advance had any where to go because the company just wanted to switch all there upper management around even though they would get demoted sometimes! I guess that is what the company call demotion just moving them to another department!!",5,Former Employee,Sales ,"Ocean Springs, MS",7/23/15,2015,7,23

don't count on it as a career.  everyday you wonder if your going to be fired for something.,"it's the most unsafe place I've ever worked at.  If you get hurt they try to talk you out of going to the ER.  If you go to the ER expect a big write up on your write up sheet.  it takes managers years fix problems.  ice cream sits on the dock for 5+ hours sometimes to the point were it is liquid.  then they put it into the freezer.  you can't re freeze ice cream.  it goes bad.  I've seen berries and vegetables all over the floor, then they use a shovel or a dust pan to pick them up and put them back into the containers and send them to the stores.  managers see it all the time and are fine with it.  that's why I will never buy food from walmart.  if the FDA did a surprise inspection the walmart DC in Johnstown, ny would get closed down.  they know when the inspections are coming and start cleaning like crazy.  the equipment malfunctions all the time to the point where it launches the person of it.  there has been a lot of injuries from that.  most people don't report there injuries.  they like to get ride of you when you report injuries or write you up saying you should of know the equipment was going to malfunction.  I know people there that worked with brokens bones.  I got wrote up for getting a splinter.  I stopped reporting injuries after that.  when you work at the  walmart DC in Johnstown, ny ,production and cases per hour are number 1 and safety if last!  be careful if your going to work there.

This job was horrible.,This job at  Wal-Mart was absolutely horrible and it's not just this Wal-Mart that I worked at it's all across the nation. I don't know where to being but the management is completely inconsiderate towards the employees by giving unrealistic expectations as well as an inability to understand how hard the working conditions are. Hard working conditions such as giving too many assignments for one employee to complete in one shift. The reason for this condition is because the greedy managers don't want to hire more employees to hire more employees. Also when you work overtime it's without pay they basically use the pay for the next day. I remember coming in one night and the manager telling me I had overtime the manager told me not to clock in until my overtime hours was up. There are so many issues with this company but I feel I'd have to write a book it. It's not a good company after Sam Walton passed away.,2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Lawton, OK",7/22/15,2015,7,22

There was also the time I had a car crash and called in every day to call in and then go it and get confronted by managers for not alerting them and them threanting to fire me.

I also had an incident where I went on vacation and was told I need to do A,B AND C to take care of everything to get paid vacation. Come back and my check is not accounted for vacation time. Find out from the co manager that I needed to do A,B,C AND D. Even though I asked everyone at the original 3 parts if that was it and they all agreed.

ATypical Wal-mart day,"I being by walking in to a normally crowded store, hurrying to the back of the store to clock in, then rushing to find a working pricing machine to swipe my badge for a register number, then having to run from where ever I am to find the Customer service manager thats on the clock so I can confirm the register I was given. Doing all of that was a pain. I never understood why I couldn't just clock in and then go to the front and have them assign me a register because they always gave me a different one then the pricing machine did anyway.  The worst part about working there were the long hours and we only got 10-15 minutes for a break and sometimes they would forget to send me to break or they would have me come back early. Normally I wouldn't care but I have a back problem that I got when I broke my tail bone that lasted quite a long time and when I tried getting my hours shortened they promised it would happen but they didn't do it for over 6 weeks even though I constantly reminded them, standing at a register with a bad back for 6-8 hours actually did damage. it got to the point where I wouldn't work there, I wouldn't even bare 2 weeks after giving a notice. I went back to school to finish my diploma, I needed to go to two different programs in order to graduate June of 2015 and the schedule they gave me didn't work with it and my availability didn't work for them.

I wouldn't recommend working here,"The managers are untrained. The employees are rude. The policies go out of the way to make it harder to work. You won't get paid a fair wage for the work you do. You won't get any medical benefits for at least a year, and even if they do give them to you, they are to expensive for your low salary. The only positive thing I can think of for this place is that no matter how little work experience you have or if you have any disabilities that make work difficult elsewhere, they are too desperate for employees to turn anyone down, though when they do hire you, they use psychological torture over incentive to keep you working there by threatening to write you up, even if you have to leave during emergencies, or by telling you that walmart is the best you will ever do in life.",1,Current Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Centereach, NY",7/21/15,2015,7,21

A job only fit for those people who like very grimy and dirty jobs.,"A typical day at the Wal Mart deli involved a lot of grease, oil, meat juices, and other very gross things. Despite having to deal with all of that, you also have to be the Flash or Wonder Woman to get everything done if you're short on staff (which we were all the time). Everything had to be constantly cooking to keep up with the time in and time out of all the food in the hot case or customer demands. Customers ranged from friendly and understanding to absolutely distasteful and hateful, especially if you were completely out of stock on a particular item. Management was almost as bad as the customers because it seemed like if they could, they'd have bull whips and use them to whip us to make us go faster. Not only that, but they had outrageous standards for everything especially when there was so little people to do what all they wanted done. There were some nights I'd be at work till midnight or later (when my shift was supposed to be over at 11) cleaning the deli because I was the only one or everybody did a little bit of the work and left me to do the rest. There was even a time when I got into trouble and got written up because a co-worker didn't clean something properly, but because I was the last one in the area, I didn't make sure it was clean.",3,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Redmond, OR",7/21/15,2015,7,21
Being at the front end of store is better than working the back room duties.,"I enjoyed the cashiering duties, but was often over-tired when released from unloading trucks, (titled inventory associate) from the back of the store._x000D__x000D_They gave me choices of where I would like to work.  I chose Cashier duties because that was what I was familiar with the last time I worked there.  My second choice was inventory associate.  When I moved to the store of Bedford, Texas, Bedford personnel and management thought I should work mostly in the backroom.  I am a people person and like to talk to customers.   Wal Mart doesn't prefer  backroom associates to talk at all.   Clearly a bad fit to be in the back room with a bunch of men and women sweating labor.",2,Former Employee,Cashier and inventory associate ,"Bedford, TX",7/21/15,2015,7,21

Department managers and associates have a better understanding of how the stores need to be run than management team and C.E.O.,"While I have enjoyed every job that I've had, this was no exception other than the cons of having to many managers with too little communication among themselves. Shifts started anywhere around 5 a.m and could last until after midnight. We pulled outdated sales product, filled any empty product, maintained prices and signs, set up all hot/cold customer service food areas, operated fryers, slicers and digital scales.

If all departments are being worked and no help is needed I would be sent to the back to bin food, liquids, pet merchandise or cosmetics until about 630 am , after that time I was sent back onto the floor to zone ( make shelves and floor clean and neat for the customers.). after zoning I would clock out at 7 am. that was a typical day working at Walmart.

Productive and fun workplace with customers,"Overall, I did enjoy my employment at Walmart. My Co-Workers were extremely friendly and we all worked hard together as a team to provide excellent customer service. Working there for over a year I've learned that customers can be extremely difficult at times, but you just have to explain to them in a polite manner why the issue was happening, or get a manager to get a better control of the situation. I've learned that it's my duty to show up to work everyday in order to succeed at my work place, and also to be there for my co-workers so they don't have to pick up any slack. The hardest part of the job would have to be when customers yell at you for not being able to do certain things for them. For example.. Sell Alcohol without ID, as well as tobacco products. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the managers are very easy to talk to if there is an issue going on, and the fact that they work with your schedule during school.

As for the associates, they were a blast to work with, they were a hard working bunch, easy to get a long, everyone respected each others differences, if one associates troubles with getting a certain isle done another associate would come and help.

Stocker for Walmart retail store,A typical day at work with walmart would be an everyday meeting talking about the the strenths and weaknesses of our work.

Management wasnt the best but you always had to work with what you have. Co-workers nice and kept to them selfs unless a customer needed something and we would do the best we could to meet that customers needs. The hardest part of the job is the work load every night.

Corrupt,this particular wal-mart suffers from to many managers wanting to promote their friends instead of those who are fit for the job. Ther is a daily struggle of management wanting things done the way they say just so they can be celebrated and praised by the store manager. These actions lead to many of the lower associates be left out to dry with out the support of the member of management that told them do do certain action that may not be the proper or ethical way of handling daily practices. On a day by day basis management makes it harder to want to come into work let alone give it everything you have to get the job done. The best part of the daily activities is just being able to look to the person on the left or right you and knowing they feel the exact same way plus being able to interact as well as joke with co-workers and customers.,3,Current Employee,UNLOADER/RECEIVING ASSOCIATE/ BACKUP LEAD ,"West hills, Ca",7/19/15,2015,7,19

Disappointment,"I worked very hard at this job and went way above and beyond what I was initially hired for as requested by my supervisors. My job description just said I was supposed to clean the restrooms/general store, take out trashes, clean up any spills, and help any customers I can. I went above and beyond that with processing and disposing of hazardous materials, being trained on a register as cashier, taking inventory of all the supplies in every department (aside from actual merchandise customers purchase), downstacking pellets of new merchandise, stocking merchandise on shelves, and anything else I was asked to do. Towards the end of my employment with Walmart my supervisor said I needed to clean the break room more, so I made it a part of my routine to clean the break room everyday after lunch. So I would clock in from lunch, and go back in the break room and clean it for about 10-15 minutes. There is no security camera in the break room, but there is one  just above the clock in computer and leading into the break room. After two weeks of me cleaning the break room after lunch my supervisor asked to see me to inform me that I was terminated for stealing company time, when I tried to explain I was just doing my job he, Derek Stiez, flat out called me a liar and said I was dishonest and my employment was terminated. _x000D__x000D_I genuinely was enjoying working for Walmart as it kept me busy and customers started recognizing me and asking me for help.

Words from Former Maintenance Worker,"From Monday through Thursday, days are not as busy as Friday through Sunday on an usual basis.  On busy days, the facility can get messy, and that makes maintenance work busy all through out the day.  Mainly what a maintenance employee has to worry about on busy days are spill calls and restroom calls.  Some tasks will have to be put off until later if the store is low on maintenance employees.  Maintenance is usually supplied with everything needed to get the job done.  There have been times where paper towels and tissue from store shelves had to be used due to lacking paper towels and tissue used by the staff.

walmart,The company is ok for someone just starting out in retail. The biggest issue is the assistant managers have no respect for their employees. they put their own needs ahead of their employees. They are so worried about making their jobs easier that they do not realize that the customers have figured out a way of getting free stuff without having to steal. The biggest problem with shrinkage is the assistants giving product for free or a much larger discount just because a customer screams at them. then they blame it on the associates instead of looking at the bigger problem which is allowing the customers to disrespect them the company and their employees. In short if you are serious about moving up in the company Walmart is not the place for you.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Deli Associate/Photo Specialist ,Michigan,7/17/15,2015,7,17

In the beginning, I learned a great deal of how to serve customers with a positive attitude as well as operating a register. Working at the service desk was rather challenging because not every customer is a pleasure to work for. Patience is definitely something to value. Once departed from that position, I moved to the back offices where I learned how to ship and receive. After that, I moved inside of our Invoice office, where I checked store reports to ensure our inventory was correct as well as any other transactions (shipping, receiving, work orders, bills) were taken care of properly.

Walmart Super Center,My typical days at Walmart was when every manager in the store was asking me to do everything for them when they seen I had two lines of customers that is waiting to seen. An d when every manager is going around the store and telling other Co workers that you are not do your job behind your back. You feel like you are doing a good job then management come around and tell you otherwise. You are so confused because you feel like you was doing a great job. Do to the facts that ever customer that came to your left the happy with what they come for. Any other business would say that the customer is always right. But not at Walmart! Walmarts Management do not care about their employees well being. For a example: Even though this actually happened. A customer of mines call in to work to talk to a manager and tell them that she could not come to work today because she broke her leg and now had to wear a cast on her leg. And management told her to come in anyway and she can work in around her area in a motor carts. I only enjoyed the customer because they was super friendly and they knew what they was looking for and they was not afraid to ask questions. Some of the co Workers there was cooler then others.

Wal-Mart,"I have worked for Wal-Mart well over a decade now.  For many years I believe it didn't deserve some of the negative publicity it was receiving.  Now, however, the culture seems to be changing more into a push for better results mentality first and concern for people second.  Don't get me wrong it has always been the nature of retail, but when people are stepping down to get away from it on a store level, there is a problem.  I am grateful to my facility, I have met some many people within the community that truly embrace what they do.  Every single day I met people that I have the ability to help, it is empowering.  The hardest part of my job is simply saying ""no"".  There has always been a limited amount of resources every month. However, given the position I have, which is one of a public face for the store everyone thinks that I can grant their wishes no matter how irrational sometimes.",3,Current Employee,Community Involvement Coordinator ,"Glenville, NY",7/14/15,2015,7,14

Depends where you are,"Wal-Mart is a good place if you are in you are in a good place. From my personal experience Wal-Mart would be alright if the corporate system was not implement on them. Some people who normal be cool changes because of their position. And it seems to happen to everybody. And the people that are working harder always seems to have the lowest pay. I'm the cart pusher so people assumed I was getting pay more. I was working in 100 degree temperature and working alone for months, but when I told them that i made minimum wage lowest in the entire building they where shocked. There were days when it was too hot, too cold, and too rainy, yet I still work alone. I ask them to fixed the machine to help me with carts but it never happen.

Great place to work and interact with customers,"Every job I have held with Walmart customer service is a must at all times, ensuring customers are satisfied with their visit and make sure they found what they were looking for. I learned a lot from this company; how to handle different situations within customers and associates, how to become and be a successful department manager, and worked in multiple areas and learning what I needed to within each department to help customers find what they needed when they came in shopping. Management was pretty cool, they tried to work with you so you have the knowledge to get the job done. Loved working with all the co-works, if you were unsure about something or didn't know how to do it they would help you understand it and lead a helping hand within your area to get job tasks done within a timely matter. Their really wasn't a hard part of my job with Walmart besides when my kids would be sick and not able to make it into work, but management would work with me at times with my schedule so I could still come in once I had a sitter to watch a sick child.

Needlessly high-stress with tactical managerial techniques.,"A typical workday consisted of stress and headaches. One task demanded we have certain number of carts for sorting grocery freight, which were often in use in other sections of the store and unable to be taken to the unloading dock. On top of this our job required us to use pallet jacks frequently. While this doesn't sound like a problem in itself there were a grand total of fifteen jacks in various states of disrepair that the store obstinately refused to repair or replace, and since the use of pallet jacks was an absulote requirement in nearly all facets of backroom work throughout the store associates were often forced to steal and hide pallet jacks from one another, creating a very distrustful atmosphere and an 'Us vs Them' mentality between the different work crews._x000D__x000D_The management was varied and constantly shifting. The backroom associates coined the saying 'Ask two managers how to get something done, you'll get three different answers'. Their lack of unity showed often with the skeleton crew the store had-yet was expected to go above and beyond as though we were over staffed at all times-with associates being taken from their assigned tasks and being made to do other work. This caused backlash not against the managers responsible but against the associate unlucky enough to be seen and pulled away by the offending manager._x000D__x000D_With the turn-over rate being as a high as it was, co-workers formed insubstantial bonds, most usually based on bellyaching while working swiftly as possible-which was frowned upon by management who were always ready with a claim on how they had - more...",3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Oklahoma City, OK",7/14/15,2015,7,14

Management could be very strict with how they wanted thing done and didn't mind personally telling people what needed to be done anyway they needed to. My co-worker's were a bit rowdy, but they got things done quickly and on time. The hardest part of the job was figuring out the machines needed to do my job, but I learn quickly, so understanding how to use/control said machine wasn't to bad of a problem.

Always looking at cleanliness and compliance. During this walk all opportunities and priorities were identified and assigned to a day shift assistant manager. Tour was approx. one hour each day. This was a time I identified coaching opportunities and made notes for myself to follow up on as well. The hardest part of this job was always being organized and teaching organization to my co managers.

A productive place to work,"My typical day as a Walmart cashier requires me to be courteous to every customer that walks through the doors and down my register, processing transactions and providing great customer services. When it comes to working at Walmart, I've learned that patience is definitely the key to working here. When customers start to push our buttons, it's our duty to keep calm and a hostile free environment. As far as the management goes, it seems that they are mainly about the store itself rather than the employees who are working for the store. In my previous jobs, my recent managers have me feel that they are all about the employees but here, it's like we are the last things on their minds. My co-workers on the other hand are kind of immature to the point where they are letting their personal lives interfere the work the put out. They hardest part of working here is feeling appreciated. The cashiers at my store are definitely under appreciated. They endure the most when it comes to handling customers and yet, no one seems to notice it or appreciate it.

Good jobs/Good to decent employee to employee friendships/excellent business learning curve of common sense in customer training/service,"Walmart: Under Sam & John, Walmart was excellent at that time. But after Sam and John passed away, the company changed. I loved working for this company until October of 2008. And really through, no fault of their own;(because I really felt like I could handle the new position in security, I fell very short of their expectations for me. I was wrong. I was the wrong kind of person for security, because I was so visible on the floor by customers that often compromised my invisibility and because I did not like the intensity of the position in confrontations. So being terminated for breaking policy was inevitable result of a bad career decision. I had moved around the stores/company in various positions and felt competent enough to handle security. I was wrong and it cost me my job. Been unemployed every since. Even tho I do not agree with all Walmart's changes since my my dismissal, I bear no ill will. I loved all the opportunities they gave me to excell, to train, to learn and grow into every position I held, and I loved giving the best service to the customers and ""making their day"", by helping them find the things to fill their daily needs.

High Pressure but satisfying,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is very unpredictable.  You start out with a plan of  what needs to be done that day.  You set your priorities such as associate evaluations, schedules, deposits, compliance  issues, etc.  You receive direction from upper management.  You  check your Emails.  Any of  this can and will be interrupted for customer assistance.  You  walk your areas of the store looking for things needing attention.  You meet with those you supervise and give them direction.  You stop anytime an associate needs to talk to you about a concern. At some point you stop for lunch.  After lunch you repeat most of the things you did earlier.  Before leaving for the day you meet with each associate you supervise that have reported later in the day.  I learned how to deal with a lot of issues working in retail including  angry customers, underperforming associates, and just how much it means to say thank you.   The  most enjoyable parts of my day were when one of my  direct reports were promoted.  The hardest part was when we had to cut payroll",3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Ocala, Fl",7/11/15,2015,7,11
So So Place To Work,"Came in started watering the plants in garden center, stocked the shelves, helped customers and ran the cash register. I learned that if you werent in the right group of people you were looked down upon, and ran out of your job. Loved most of the people I worked with but they were some that butted heads with me a lot. Dealing with people who didnt like you and wanted to run you off on everyday was the worst part of working there. I got 40 hours a week.",3,Former Employee,"Sales Floor Associate, Phone Operator ","Gainesville, GA",7/11/15,2015,7,11
Life at wal-mart,There is no typical day at Wal-Mart. There are some good days and then there are some bad days. But the good days always out weigh the bad.

Retail store,A typical day was customer interaction and exchanging money for product. I learned  about how to diffuse trying situations with customers. The management was acceptable in what they did although it could be difficult to get assistance from them. the co workers were friendly and helpful when they could be. the hardest part of the job was the bust days with minimal employees. the enjoyable part was hard to pin down.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Kimball, TN",7/11/15,2015,7,11

nothing positive to say about WalMart,"Too many chiefs; not enough indians.  Never enought help scheduled.  Most mgrs. lack interpersonal skills.  I was hired as a sales associate for the paint/hardware dept but was never taught how to use an RFD scanner.  The more I did and the harder I tried, the less it was appreciated.  I'll never understand why a company would not want their employees to have the best training.  I did learn how to mix paint.  Mostly I was a gopher putting returns back on the shelf.  Most younger employees would have accepted other jobs at other businesses if there were any available.  The only positive thing I can say about them is that they will hire old people.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Anderson, SC",7/11/15,2015,7,11
It's Walmart alright,"It's typically what you would expect when you think of working for Walmart, not really much respect between management and employees.

Wal-mart as how I view it,"I enjoy my job. I work in the tire department, I've worked in various areas and I have learned several skills working in those areas. The co-workers are long term works for the most part and the management isn't that great. Day to day I mount tires and provide customer service. The hardest part of the job would be when I do not have all the tools necessary to complete or do a good job. What I love most about my job is the amount of freedom I have and how relaxed it can be. It's a very straightforward job.",4,Current Employee,Tire Technician ,Sam's Club Nashville TN,7/11/15,2015,7,11

Good work place pay is worth it in time,A usual day at work is that I come in at 2pm everyday and prep the place for clean up. I serve any customer currently standing at the counter slice deli me and cook. Later my focus is cleaning the area and having it prepped for the next day. During my time there I've learned the value of customer service and management is understanding of the issues of the area and do their best to work with us accordingly. The hardest part of the job is just the workload at night if the other employees choose not to help with clean up. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with customers even when the job is difficult the satisfied customer is worth it.,4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Hinesville, GA",7/11/15,2015,7,11

"Blue collar, physical labor","The job of orderfiller becomes dull and mundane quickly and takes a toll on your body (lots of heavy lifting).  That being said, the pay is pretty good compared to similar positions, it offers health and other insurances, retirement savings, vacation time (starting after a year of employment), and a deferred holiday pay program.  Also, if you get burnt out from orderfilling (most do after a few years), it is fairly easy to switch positions within the warehouse or find a job elsewhere in the company if you want a change of locale.",3,Current Employee,Orderfiller ,"Moberly, MO",7/11/15,2015,7,11

positve mostly however...,"working at Walmart is a good experience for the most part. the lower rating comes from moving to a new store and having new management not listen to the more experienced employees on some things and not being flexible enough to try to implement associate ideas(my way or the highway type of mentality). other than that issue i have nothing but positive things to say about Walmart. decent pay, decent benefits(no dental for part-time) .",3,Current Employee,Produce Associate ,TN,7/11/15,2015,7,11

Almost as expected from working for a multi-national super-company.,"I worked for Wal-Mart first as a maintenance associate, and as a Garden Center sales associate. I would not recommend working as a maintenance associate for those who are weak-stomached, or have more than a shred of dignity as you will be doing exactly what you think a maintenance associate would be doing. (Hint: You will be cleaning human feces on a daily basis.). The promotion to a garden center sales associate was a huge relief to me, and it is a much more dignifying job, that also pays more (which makes no sense to me). The management at Wal-Mart is perhaps the worst part of the job, and if you ever work there, you will find yourself avoiding them at all cost. It's odd to me that most of the management at Wal-Mart have started out as associates, yet they seem to know very little of the store's operation. You will find yourself making decisions that a manager should make, because they are incredibly unhelpful, or impossible to find.",3,Former Employee,"Sales Associate, Cashier, Maintenance Associate ","Conway, AR",7/8/15,2015,7,8

Favoritism and Associates set in their ways.,"While Working at this particular store, I am given a task and I do my best to complete that task before the end of my shift. Although management has not been that great. They are nice enough to work with my husbands Navy schedule, but they complain about and make me feel unwanted there. There is a big age difference in this store and i believe that might be most of my troubles, they see me and they see a kid, rather then an adult. My co-works have all been working with the company for 10+ years so they are all stuck in there ways and don't like to hear new or faster ways of doing things.

It has it's ups and downs,"Working at Wal-Mart has it's good and bad days. Some days are fun and I tend to enjoy my job. I enjoy the face to face customer reaction, even the difficult ones. I enjoy working with most of my peers too. The management is the problem. Wal-Mart is ran like a prison at times. The Store Manager is the warden, who hands orders down to the guards (assistant and department managers), who then enforce said orders on the prisoners (associates). Not every manager conducts themselves in this way though. There are definitely some amazing people I've had the pleasure of meeting and knowing in my time there. But the culture and environment that has been set is disappointingly tiresome. There is no rest. The moment you slow down and take a breather there's a manager there to crack the whip and tell you to get back to work or else they'll find you some work. It's a nice first job that teaches discipline and good work ethic, but long term? I don't see a future there.",2,Former Employee,Wireless Sales Associate ,"Livermore, CA",7/7/15,2015,7,7
Was a nice job to have,"A typical day working at Walmart was smooth. I've learned no matter what , the customer is always right.

Not a place to work permanitly,The company requires open scheduling for part time Employment. Most employees are hired on part time with the worst schedules. Chances of advancement are very low. Chances on pay increase is determined by supervisory individual opinion not baised on work productivity or quality. Discounts are at a low 10% and excludes special pricing on products.

"The job was good for a short time, but wouldn't work there any longer than I did.","The jobs I performed weren't really all that bad at all.  If you have even just a moderate work ethic you'll get through any day with ease.  I never disliked working here, but if it was my career I would probably have disliked it more.  People can be moved around (up or down) arbitrarily, and some of the people are just generally incompetent.  If I had been there for an extended period I would've eventually been frustrated by how lazy and apathetic people here can be, while I worked to the best of my abilities.

For the most part I loved my job and my co-workers. The atmosphere was always busy and exciting.,"A typical day at Walmart wasn't typical compared to other jobs I had in the past , each day was a brand new day that all of my training and common sense  as well as  creativity were challenged . I thought that customer service was basically the same across the board in business. I was very wrong and I learned that for instance in the hospitality industry has nothing in common with retail customer except for great customer satisfaction, but the path to achieving that satisfaction requires a whole new set of rules for the end results. For the most part my management team was awesome and professional with a real open door policy as well as supportive . The hardest part of my job was when new management came in and cleaned house leaving my front of the store short of  staff that jeopardizes customer satisfaction and service. While I was never approached by upper management for unsatisfactory job performance , I was a little worried about my job security because of seeing very qualified employees terminated  that had dedicated their entire career to this company because of personality differences instead of job performance.

My co-workers are great and I have no problems with any of them, they are all very supportive and are great at helping me anytime I have a question.

First time getting lucky by working at a Walmart Store.,What I learned about Walmart is that certain supervisors don't respect the employees 100%. They purposely give you write-ups/coaching when they think your not doing a great job. They don't give your verbal warnings when your doing something wrong. They place all blame solely on the employee.,5,Current Employee,Overnight Maintenance Associate/Stocker ,"Richmond, VA",7/6/15,2015,7,6

Loved the environment and the people i worked with,I would go into work to find most haven't done there job n had to do it all over myself. I learned at Walmart if I wanted it done right I had to do it myself. I loved most of my management. they was really fair n tried to help in any way they could. Most of my co-workers didn't care bout being there was just there to stand around and talk n get paid for it they didn't want to work like I did. the hardest part of my job is they expected more from me than I could do on a daily bases by myself. I loved my job there at Walmart is that they understood what I was about n that's not to half do something. When they wanted something done they came to me to get it done right the first time.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Knoxville,tn",7/5/15,2015,7,5

Stressful and lacking in any sort of respect for associates.,"While I enjoyed the exercise that the physical labor gave me as a stocker, I did not appreciate anything else that came with this job.  The usual work loads were doable, but due to the skeleton crew that the overnight shift typically ran on, time was of the essence just about every single day.  Thus, management was typically very stressed out and not very helpful if any problems arose during the shift.  Many of the tools needed for our job, such at pallet jacks, hand scanners, and hand printers, were broken.  Supplies, such as plastic wrap for overstock pallets and wires for making cardboard bales, were sparse and restocked inconsistently.  The turnover rate was very high throughout my time at the store, especially on the second shift.  As the second shift was responsible for bringing the freight out to the sales floor for my shift to work, they too were running on a constantly dwindling crew.  They frequently could not bring all the new freight out on time, which then burdened my shift as we had to spare time we did not have to help them.  Respect was practically nonexistent.  Even veterans who were with the store for decades were treated just as poorly as new associates.  The job benefits were barely noticeable, and frequent, month-long schedule blackouts made it very difficult to use any vacation/personal hours one accumulated at this job.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend working for Walmart at all unless you were absolutely desperate for a job of any kind.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Everett, WA",7/5/15,2015,7,5

IT was ok.,Typical day at Walmart was a little stressful but I held it together a lot of complaining customers because of the lack of cashiers. What I learned at Walmart was patience. I had patience but this job really showed me that you really got to have a lot of patience when it comes to these types of jobs. Management was ok could have been better but ok. Some of my co workers was rude but for the most part I got along with everyone. The hardest part was having to hear the customers complain about there being no cashiers. The most enjoyable part was the customers that had patience and like to see us happy and don't give us a hard time about it not being enough of us.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Nashville, TN",7/5/15,2015,7,5
Typical Walmart Experience,"I don't know if any other Walmarts are the same as the one I worked at back in Camden, Tennessee, but what I do know that is that sales associates and cashiers don't make enough for the amount of work we do.  _x000D__x000D_I didn't hate my job, but I didn't like it either.  Often times, the electronics would be hotter than anywhere else in the store, we weren't allowed to have a fan in the department to keep us cool. We were majorly understaffed.  At times, I was left running electronics, photo lab, connections center, toys, and sporting goods, by myself.  God forbid if it was busy those nights, those were the nights where I'd thought I'd lose my sanity. _x000D__x000D_However, while I didn't like the compensation for the amount of work that, not only me, but my co-workers did, I did my job well, helping customers, making sure they were taken care of, answering their questions, and getting them out the door in a timely manner._x000D__x000D_I have nothing but respect for Walmart employees, you guys are tough and strong.

Life as a Walmart Pharmacy Technician,I loved working for Walmart. The only reason I had to leave was because they would not offer full-time to their employees. The pharmacy is incredibly modern and the work flow makes handling day to day activities as easy as possible. I couldn't pick a better pharmacy to work for.,5,Former Employee,Registered Pharmacy Technician ,"Ontario, OH",7/4/15,2015,7,4
Different experience,"I would be showered with a list of work and deadlines with little to no assistance from management and/or associates. The work itself was not difficult but the amount provided was overwhelming._x000D_I would have a number of associates to my name but they would be picked off one by one to assist in other locations of the store regardless of my priorities and with that happening, I would be penalized for the work that was not completed. I have had a couple of arguments with management due to unfair working conditions but would still try to arrange my sequences to help meeting my daily goals. I am huge on team work but felt like it was never provided. I was given the impression that every other department had priority over my and that I should have little to no opinion._x000D_I did enjoy the fact that I was constantly busy and never standing around.

Stressful yet exciting work environmrnt,A typical day at work is very stressful. It consists of associates constantly coming into the office asking questions and expressing their concerns.

Management expects you to complete large loads of freight, however, once you get used to your supervisors and the workplace, it can be a fun place to work at, depending on your management. Co-workers are from a variety of backgrounds and you can end up learning about other cultures. The hardest part of the job is having to complete the heaviest workload of the store, and management keeps asking or telling you to go perform other duties while you still need to complete all of yours.

If everyone would have great communcation with the employees not just the management team . if they communicated with the employees everthing would make the store a better place. Like at the walmart where i work at there is a certain manager that always get his way never is accounted for his action. he does what he wants and the store manager does nothing about it to solve the problem. This manager was put as manager not ever having experience as management. Not knowing how to talk to customers, im always hearing  complaints about this manager from the customers.

Management comes in during the day is upset with the overnight crew for not being able to bin the massive amount of new freight in the imaginary bin space.

Productive work enviroment,"A typical day of work at the Wal-Mart bakery includes filling shelves so we have the product to sell to customers when our shelf stock gets low.  This also includes breaking out the frozen for the nest days baking and scanning the day old rack multiple days within one evening.  We are to assist a customer if at all possible even when it is outside your department.

It's a h#%^  hole to work at.Its a hard place to work because its all about putting it on the floor in any manor. I didn't learn anything and the people were back stabbers. Management had no one's back and would sell you down the river in a minute. Co-works were phony and the hardest part was dealing with them. the most enjoyable part was leaving.,2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Farmville, VA",6/28/15,2015,6,28
Stressfull work enviorment,Every day when you go in you never know if you will actually be in your department or if they will send you to a different department. You could get pulled at anytime to work in a different area weather you know it or not and are expected to complete the task. Management is not positive. Having to fight to get time off even when you put in for months ahead. Constantly being told that its never good enough. Having a manager personally degrade/humiliate you in front of customers and other staff.,2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pontiac, IL",6/28/15,2015,6,28

Just like in any normal work place, some gossip goes around, and everyone has a group they eat with at lunch, but generally everyone is amazingly friendly! Everyone gets their work done as well as they are able, and trainers are well picked. Management, however, isn't what it needs to be. There are many times when a manager is needed, they aren't there, or are too busy, and same with team leaders.

Okay for a first job (overnight),"Walmart was a good experience for a first job, but i wouldn't want it to be made a career unless you desire to go up in management rankings. You will meet a lot of new people within the job outside and inside the faculty of Walmart. Other than that you will be overworked and pulled away from the area that you are supposed to be working under almost everyday. A lot of times upper management doesn't care much of the employees. The only reason I stayed for awhile was due to the co-workers who were friendly and understood my predicament as a college student and working 45+ hours with very little sleep.

a good place to start,"If your just starting out in pharmacy I think Walmart is a good place to start. It all depends on the people you work with. High tech turnover is a big problem. I cant tell you how many people I had to train just to have them quit, or fail the certification exam. In the area I worked, we had alot of low-income patients. Some of them are very nice but alot of them are very rude and expect everything handed to them on a silver platter because they have Gold Medicaid Card. You make a mistake billing the insurance: ""I dont pay fo my medicine."" Medicaid does'nt cover or requires prior auth: ""I dont pay fo my medicine."" You get the picture. If you can overlook all that then Walmart might just be the place for you.",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Jacksonville, FL",6/25/15,2015,6,25

I pull prescriptions from the will call bins and help analyze any problems or concerns with patients. If I'm unable to help, I let the customer speak to the pharmacist at the council window. I love the have my independence at my job, and I also flow with my co-workers. At the end of the day, I always feel like I've accomplished a lot and helped people.

I was hired on as a sales associate to tackle putting merchandise on shelves and organizing the grocery department. The things that I learned were mechanical. I didn't use a PDA or anything fancy. I generally stocked merchandise and reordered shelves and put new merchandise on empty shelves. The management and co-workers there seemed like they despised their jobs. Even at team meetings they looked cheerful, but when they went back to doing their daily jobs they looked miserable. No one looked happy there and employees and even managers looked uptight. The mood was unsettling and the people I had worked with were reserved and hardly ever spoke.

I have learned how corporate Walmart wants the store to look, what is considered incorrect, and how to read stocking labels. The management is okay, but it seems some lack the professional training. Sometimes their approach could be more professional and less demeaning. The physical labor is the hardest part of the job, I have to lift many heavy objects, and kneel for long periods of time.

They never assisted with anything they took longer breaks than allowed, they had personal relationships between the coworkers and management, they showed favoritism to friends, and they never properly trained me for the job I had to learn on my own through older coworkers with seniority.

Can be great depends on politics management,"I have worked all over the store for Wal-Mart. I have had great days and horrible days. I worked at eight different locations and held seven different positions through promotions over twelve years. Everything is regulated like the government. It is private business but over the years as it continued to grow it regulated everything at the store level. When I started you could be creative with merchandising and when you went to lunch, how your back room was organized. My first store was a 100 million dollar store so we had a lot of talent. Unfortuantely some stores underperformed and as a public company strategies were devised to reign in control to the corporate level. For example I worked at one store for six years that was on the poorer side of town. Each month we advertised merchandise known as TAB. Some months once, some months two or three times depending on the season. Each store was allocated a certain amount of each product based on past sales, store trait, and negotiation with supplier on product. The issue with this is we would recieve high end appliances or linens with customers that had no interest of purchasing them. Then the merchandise takes up space. Then you have to wait for markdowns which the store manager had to budget for the entire 200000sq ft store each month. Result shelf space on feature ends was wasted for products that nobody wanted and backed up quality features that sat in the backroom. When you take away 95% of the control away from people at the store level you lose valuable insight because they see whats happening on a daily basis for that particular - more...",4,Former Employee,"Sales associate, zone manager, assistant manager, ","Rockford, IL",6/18/15,2015,6,18

a day at Walmart,"This is not my first time to work for a major corporation like Walmart. my day consists of backroom activity which mostly remains there.

I started as an unloader which is the hardest working postion. overtime is seldom allowed unless authorized. mostly all Associates I work with or see on a daily basis are friendly and I get along with them. never have a problem with what management and supervisors directing me on tasks.benefits are good, hardest part of the job is handling of the freight after its been on the floor, open cases, product falls out, too much overstock in back room.",3,Current Employee,Inventory Associate ,"Tyler, TX",6/18/15,2015,6,18

But, while I allow myself to work and give it my all regardless of any situation I might encounter. Management should be respected always. They have a job to do just like the employees. Just a higher position. There their, to help. To make it better for the customers,store,employees, and thereslves. Co-workers to me are like a reflection of myself. We should be one in everything. Co-workers are to help each other in times when I or each other don't know the answer.The hardest part of a job would be,not fully helping someone. Or giving that person half work.

When I first get to work, I take a look to see what kind of production that I need to fill up our cake case.  I make a list to make sure that I do not forget anything.  Then I gather all my supplies to start my production.  After my shift, I start to clean my area.  I clean my silverware, the table that I used and the floor where I was standing.  After I finish cleaning, I take the trash and cardboard that I used throughout the day.  I have learned to be more prepared for certain holidays and teamwork.  When I first started the job I did not know how to cake decorate.  I am excited to learn new things and learn things very quickly.  Management sometimes listens to the things that we are saying and sometimes they do not seem to listen to anything that we have to say.

While most lived for making drama, I made a few lasting friends there. One word for Management : Shadey. They like who they like and everyone else is just there. Management can be just has bad ( if not worse!) than the associates when it came to gossiping. When it come to write up, they will do it to anyone who will let them get away with it.

I was happy working there...,"It was great working @ Walmart because I felt like I was able to earn an income after being so sick for a long time. I felt really good about my little test that I gave myself. I was able to handle difficult people that were in a bad mood whatever the situation was with a calmness and I was happy to have made a few friends while there. The other Cashiers are a great bunch of people to work with. _x000D__x000D_Although, in regards to the point system they have for tardies, absences (approved or unapproved), No Call, No Shows I am not liking how they operate that part of the company. Suffice it to say, there were a couple of cashiers that had some family emergencies that they were gone for a while dealing with the issues that came of it and ended up being pointed out and let go. Even when the situation was an emergency type. The circumstances and the work ethics of the individual in question should have been taken a closer look at and then base the final decision on those issues. _x000D__x000D_But, for the most part, I loved working there @ Store #4993 or is it #4339 On Old US 20 in Elkhart, IN.

Walmart taught me that there are all kinds of people in this world.  Especially in Tifton!  The management in Walmart, to me, were a bit biased, uncaring, selfish, unfriendly, and power stricken.  They were probably the most difficult people to deal with on the job.  My coworkers were amazing to work with.  Although we didn't always see eye-to-eye, we still got our work done.  They were friendly, funny, down to earth, and just down right crazy(but in a good way).  The hardest part of the job was trying to get days off school activities that I had to attend.

We got a new associate and my whole schedule changed and they split my days off apart which in the situation I was in was not able to do that. The manager asked me to come in early to work on a project, I came in and they said I wasn't supposed to come in til later and I was making my own schedule and I was a liar to my face they said this.

Cashier at Wal-Mart,"This job, albeit simple, was very taxing. Rather than spend my day walking, I stood in one spot for nine hours a day, five or six days a week. This was rough on my knees, as I hadn't previously worked any other jobs aside from two months at Jack In the Box in Arizona, and I had lived a very sedentary lifestyle in my adolescent years._x000D__x000D_Eventually, my knees were the primary reason I left. I requested on several occasions that I be scheduled shorter shifts due to the knee pain, but they disregarded those requests, and I eventually got to a point where I felt like I was going to collapse on the shift. I also had knee pain when working at Applebee's, but was able to somewhat address it with diet and work through that pain._x000D__x000D_What I learned was my initial experience in dealing with the public professionally. I was responsible for ringing items through in a timely fashion. We cashiers could print up our rate of item ring-outs, and mine was among the top speeds. There wasn't much work to it aside from managing the cash in the register accurately; it was naturally crucial to give correct change and keep that money on the level._x000D__x000D_I did make some friends among the co-workers, and my CSM or front-end supervisor in particular, Betty, was very kind to me and understanding when I needed to take a leave due to some troubling family and life matters._x000D__x000D_Its hard to say what the most enjoyable part of the job was, aside from lunch, as it gave me a chance to rest.

Challenging working environment with many things to learn and a very fun pool table.,"Although almost every day is a challenging day working for Walmart and with the proper human communication skills therein, there are some things at Walmart that are overlooked and could use a bit of refinement. Walmart is high on my personal list to challenge your physical as well as logical skills and it does provide somewhat of a homely atmosphere. However it is adamantly enforced by the managers to get the job done during, at times, seemingly unrealistic time intervals and to advance to another task at yet again unrealistic time frames. _x000D_Of course, job's not impossible nor are these tasks. Yet as much energy you need to put into it at just a little above minimum wage, it stands hardly worth the time as well as tiresome effort in the long run. Benefits are really nice, but raises are somewhat ridiculously moderated and not even to provide overtime anymore for these very hardworking employees is not so very associate-friendly. Everyone knows Walmart's all about saving a pretty penny, but to increase the productivity of its associates while cutting their numbers of staff certainly doesn't seem like such an honorable thing to do; as it is implied of course for saving money and living better at Walmart.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Queen Creek, AZ/Tempe, AZ",6/13/15,2015,6,13
Over worked and under appreciated in a fast paced and ever changing role,"Wal-Mart's AP department has had an identity crisis for many years, each and every year our roles and responsibilities change and get added to and have now switched to an operations job. They continually add more work to our plate without taking anything else away and don't leave room for dealing with day to day issues in the stores. Upper management has no respect or understanding for what we go through every day and want no ""excuses"" for why you couldn't complete a newly assigned task, that includes if you were out sick, on vacation or helping cover/ assist another store with a project or internal. It's nearly impossible to become an APM in Wal-Mart now if you have an APA/ LP background in catching shoplifters. They now prefer if you have an operational or cash office/paperwork background.",3,Current Employee,Asset Protection Manager/ Security ,"Norwich, CT",6/13/15,2015,6,13

"I have very good quatlies as a worker. I am honest, dependable, accountable, active listener, quick learner, advocate of patient rights.","A typical day at work is enjoyable. I learn every day how to deal with co-workers, how to treat a patient or any customer with respect of cultural back ground. I make a daily plan, set priorities so I can get my work done in a timely manner. I am a real team player, willing to help my co-workers whenever needed to accomplish the assigned task for the day. I  only have two work experiences in this country: Plantation Key Convalescent Center (nursing home) and Wal-Mart (commercial setting). The hardest part of the job at Plantation key used to be the accommodation to staff shortage. It's always  challenging when you have two more patients added to your work load for a day. At Wal-Mart, the hardest part of the job is the customer service. For example, I sell fishing licenses; if I am supposed to get off at 10:00 PM and a customer shows up at 10:00, as long as I am still at the desk I have to take care of the customer. That sometimes changes my plans. However, I know in any business, customer comes first. The most enjoyable part of my job anywhere is to satisfy my patient or customer by providing compassionate patient care and excellent customer service, moreover to bring a smile to someone's face.",4,Current Employee,Clerk-Cashier and Sales Associate ,Florida,6/13/15,2015,6,13

However my typical day in Toys would start by trying to get the department zoned while helping customers, but instead of allowing me to get caught up, because of my gender and size I was pulled from my job to help in the back, with receiving merchandise. Leaving my area to suffer and the next day when it wasn't done, I would be pulled back again to do it all over again never being allowed to get caught up. This would cause issues with the other management in my department and heads. I was called to the office several times because my department was a constant mess on my shift, but when I told them I would be pulled, they told me I simply needed to work harder.

Great Place to Advance!,"I am employed at the highest volume store on the east coast. I've learned so much from working at this store that I carry with me as I advance in my career goals. The management team recognizes associates who work hard. Promotions come from within and there is no glass ceiling for career advancement. A typical work day depends on the amount of traffic projected. If traffic is high, then more associates are sent to the sales floor for assistance. If traffic is low, then associates can branch out and assist in other sales floor and back room needs. I have learned a lot about the target customer, sales, and what going into creating the sales floor. As a Department Manager, I have learned how to be a leader, staffing, how to plan and position for future events, how my decisions affect others, assisting to the needs of customers and associates, and much more. The Upper Management team (Shift and Assistant Managers) changes in some way every 4-5 months so that managers can develop in different areas of the store and/or market.

While working nights is another story. Policies are strict but very easy and reasonable to adapt. The enjoyable part of the job is that employees voices are heard.  Suggestions are always welcomed.

Busy Work Place,"As an employee of Wal-Mart, I've learned working for a large corporation you tend to get lost in the ""system."" You are not recognized by name, but by numbers. Most members of management do not even know your job duties. Communication on managements' part could use a little work as well._x000D_A typical overnight shift at our store location would typically be a four thousand piece general merchandise truck that needs to be fully stocked and binned by seven A.M. Starting at ten P.M. with a daily meeting in the break room. Goals are discussed regarding the present day and the night before and a line up is given. The line up is the list of associates and the area they are assigned to stock for that night. Everyday the line up changes depending on the amount of freight and associates scheduled. In certain circumstances associates are given a ""home"" which is an area you know you will stock on a nightly basis. My ""home"" was the housewares department. Generally it's about one fourth of the general merchandise; vacuums, microwaves, steam cleaners, dishes, silverware, kitchen appliances and gadgets, ironing boards, irons, canning jars, storage totes, etc. The hardest part was not only working one of the largest departments in the store, but by myself. I wasn't always able to express my concerns to the manager on duty because of my work load. It did in fact help the night pass more quickly, but I rarely had an opportunity to speak with a manager about my concerns.

good part-time job to wok for the pay and duties,"its a job that I loved to do. Helping customers to find what they needed or locate an item was highlights of the job.

Some Co Workers were not trained or crossed trained in different departments properly so a lot of customers found it frustrating to find people to help them.  I hope that changes.

Constant activity and changing dynamics.,A typical work days last from 10 to 16 hours.  Requires significant time on your feet moving around the store.  Generally speaking there is an expectation for managers to work late each day mainly due to the fact that the goal is pay no hourly associates OT.  Management is generally professional and has high expectations for all associates.  The most difficult part of the job is trying to find a balance between home life and work life.  Most enjoyable part of the job for me is the dynamic situations that arise everyday.,3,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,New Jersey,6/8/15,2015,6,8

Fun Environment,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, the people where friendly and helpful. The advancement opportunities where there as well. A typical day at my job would be. Clock in and then begin checking all the high priced items into the log book. After that was completed I then would zone, which consist of walking the aisles and making sure all the merchandise is where it is supposed to be, and if it is make sure it is nicely presented. I would then check a few customers out, pull some games from the cabinets, maybe walk a few items to the customer service desk. A lot of times customers would come in for phones, so I would then unlock a few cell phones and activate them. And when the day slows down and there is not a lot to do, I would then clean. Although  I enjoyed my job, there were some hard parts to it. Such as, on a really busy day customers would be piling in one after another all wanting to be helped right then and there. And a lot of times I would be the second if not the only person back there, so it did get hectic.

With management they are around but i did not have a problem all that much so i never really spoke with them. The co workers at Walmart may also be a bit snobby and rude at times. Best thing to do it mind your business and work your shift, The hardest part of the job is dealing with the coworkers.

Challenging and always learning,"As an assistant manager you work three 12 hour shifts and in that time you are responsible for not only your area of the store but also your partners that has been chosen for you.

Also the company throws you in like a fish without water and you have to master your own rhythm in order to get what needs to be done and you are learning as you go. Management open to questions but ultimately really leaves you on your own, my management style is more teach the person to fish but let them think before you give any help. The hardest part of the job was having enough coverage and being able to figure out how you were going to get the days workload accomplished.

Cashier/Sales Associate at Walmart,"I have been a cashier at Walmart for almost 2 years now. I was first employed in October of 2013 and was 16 years old at the time. My starting wage was $7.65 as a cashier, but was $7.45 when I transferred into retail. I really enjoyed my co-workers, but the members of management are ridiculous. The rules that have been enforced are absurd in my opinion. The biggest conflict that I have with Walmart is being excused for 3 absences in a 6 month time frame. It would not be such a struggle if the managers allowed their employees time off when they needed it, but they don't allow their employees the time off. I have missed the past two Thanksgivings and Christmas Eves because I was scheduled to work those days. I had to write multiple hand-written notes and ask for time off on the Wire so that I would be able to make it to my own graduation party and commencement!

MY co workers are pretty good and they always tell me they are happy to see me when I am there because I catch all their calls and I am there to help them when they need me to be.  The hardest part of my job is keeping up with having enough registers open when we are busy.  This goes back to having upper management support.

Staying on task and making sure you make the company look great!,When you look forward to coming to work for the customers knowing they always entertain you or being trained in everything in three months of being on the job you cant wait to see where they're going to place you today.I learned that you sometimes have to humble yourself when you may be having a bad day or the customer you have to know how to pick up on attitudes also so you know how to handle your customer. Making sure that if you handled that customer that you left such a great impact that they want to return!Knowing when to back down and get help if you need it is OK we all learn daily so getting help is not a down fall it takes an adult to know when to back up ans stand aside.Every job i ever did i make it fun most times you have to so you can look forward to doing it and fun doesn't mean not doing  your job or goofing off but it means to make the best out of every task you receive to the best of your ability so that when you go home you can say MY JOB IS COMPLETE.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rochester,Ny",6/3/15,2015,6,3

I enjoyed my customer's coming up to me and telling me how they liked the department.  I even was able to customize for my customers and that was even more fun.  I was increasing sales up to 17 % from the year before.  However like I said, when the management changes then the atmosphere changes.

Company not fair to all associates.,"Typical day at work was busy and even busier during the holiday season. I learned we were not fully staffed at the front end to get customers checked out within a reasonable amount of time. The company was hiring but cashiers didn't seem to stay around for long periods of time for various reasons. Some members of management were easy to work with and would even help out by getting on the register to get lines down. Other members of management didn't bother to help out when needed. Overall working with co-workers was great; however, the company started to hire a lot of high school age people and didn't have enough cashiers after 9:00 pm during the week. The hardest part of the job was company not being fair to the associates. For example, younger associates got on their phones at the register instead of working, while others were eating on the job and nothing was done about these situations. Also an issue of few allowed absences in a short period of time. For example, being a single mom and having to take care of sick children, I wasn't allowed to stay home.

Insightful experience that has prevented me from ever shopping at walmart again.,"After working at walmart I got a chance to see just how poorly the company is ran. Managers pulled tricks to make things look full and never ordered enough merchandise to keep the shelves stocked. On top of that the company had a very non customer orriented feel to it. As a matter of fact you could lose your job for helping a customer when you aren't on the clock.

They're great teachers and excellent friends. My co-workers i consider family they mean the world to me and then some. I felt alone going in but, they've adopted me into this warm loving family bond.

A good place to work part time.,"Walmart is not a goo place to work if you want to move out and live on your own, but if you're looking for a part time job or something over the summer it is a good place to start. Managers at the weymouth store are friendly and they take notice if you come in on time and do your job. If it were not for the fact that I do not get paid a living wage, I would have no problem continuing to be a cart pusher at weymouth walmart. There is good job security and usually plenty of hours if you want them. The most difficult part of being a cart pusher is that there are usually not enough carts for all the customers who need them. Bad weather is not usually a concern. Management will let you store use gloves, rain ponchos, water bottles, sunscreen, and other things you may need. You may be required to do a few dirty jobs if maintenance calls out, but doing those sorts of jobs only earns you praise from the managers, who more often than not will repay the favor when you request a day off.",3,Current Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Weymouth, MA",5/31/15,2015,5,31

Easy place to get a job. After that its a coinflip,"I have worked for Walmart many times so I am going to average my experiences for this review._x000D__x000D_One thing that is a benefit of Walmart is it is very easy to get a job there. I worked for Walmart so many times mostly due to a string of moving I had to do._x000D_The managers I worked with varied. I had some that where really nice and made you feel like apart of a team. They saw the work you were doing and gave you opportunities to move up. Then there were the managers that clearly did not care about anyone. You would stay in a job and they would hire new people in for advancement positions. Coin flip. You can work hard but if you find that you are not being recognized you may be stuck. If you can try to be on one of the specialized teams/departments. Those jobs come with better management, job security and training. For example you are looking to be apart of; Inventory Control, Electronics, The tire center, Sporting goods or Loss prevention. You want to avoid; Cart Pusher, truck unloading and toys. I say this because in my experience, those area while demanding seem to be stopping points and dead ends. Your experience may vary but the harder jobs tend to have higher turn overs which can leave you stuck. Also try and be apart of a shift that only has one set of management. The truck Crew for example would not be on my avoid list if it wasn't for the problem of it being in a management change over. Some times you will end up with three different manager shifts. Managers often advance people they are working with and can see doing a good job.

Has its ups and downs.,"Working for the company of Wal-Mart can be deceiving. I work 3rd shift so a lot of the tasks are thrown on us. I have worked for two stores now, and I must say both have shown disappointment. I have learned a lot in business, ever since the 8th grades, and knowing that the managers made it too their position baffles me. My general work night is supposed to control how much inventory goes out, and in the backroom warehouse. It would go swell if we were staffed. We are always understaffed, and the ones that are here are expected to work twice as hard to fill those spots that management decided not to fill.

What can I say......,"I enjoyed working for Walmart for the majority of the time that I worked there.  For the most part, I was valued as an associate and my hard work was appreciated.  I was involved in a severe car accident which took me away from work for 3 months.  Due to the severety of the injuries I endured, I was not able to go back to being a cashier.  When i was able to return to work, I was given a hard time and they did not want to put me in a position that I was capable of performing.  At that point they put me back to work but was the worst hours available and the minimum I could work and keep my benefits.

Manager got me another job,Loved the departments but health issues from a car wreck and I was told I was over qualified for the jobs. People working in these departments need to be further trained in doing their jobs. This company needs to give a lot more on hands training. Most of the associate are not alert  to what is going on in the store. or their surroundings. A lot of stealing from the employees and no one wants to report it.

I really liked putting away freight, going into the back to get customers their product.

However, there was an issue with a certain manager, who was new to the position, who thought he was better than everyone else and would take certain female employees off somewhere, no one knowing where they had gone for periods of time.

Terrible,I would not ever recommend Walmart as a place of employment. My pharmacy family and I got along well but the rest of the management outside of the pharmacy is terrible.

"Overall, not an experience i regret","Typical day involved engaging with customers and making them feel welcomed and appreciated for shopping at Wal-Mart. I was taught how to handle trouble customers and how to efficently solve problems with resolutions that could benefit us as a company as well as the customers. Management was really my only complaint. They seemed to all have different methods of accomplishing the same task and would repremand employes on ""not doing it their way"" which led to much confusion among newer associaties. I loved being able to interact and talk with all sorts of people all day.

Very Productive,It was a great environment to work in but as time passed there was less employees to open and close the store. All tasks were put on two or three people while there was hundreds of customers. Supervisors would call in most of the times. Management would not listen to supervisors when they told them they needed more cashiers. Upper Management had no clue how to help cashiers with the register maybe only one manager out of all five of them. Other than that co workers were easy to get along with and I made great friendships from Walmart. Enjoyable part was being able to talk to customers and see them happy. Hardest part was when we are under staff because I would always have to run back and forth trying to assist customers and employees as if I was supervisor and I wasn't.,4,Former Employee,Cashier/ Customer Service Rep ,"San Antonio, TX",5/29/15,2015,5,29

Gained great customer service experience,"Working at Wal-Mart is a great experience. I believe I have learned more from working there than my previous job. When I started working there I had to learn new things on the register, using WIC cards, and using EBT cards. I also had to learn new things such as when we need something we have to put in action codes, blink our light, and wait for someone to come and assist my customer and I. After being a cashier I moved up to be a Sales Associate in which I still assisted customers, but I had to get merchandise for them such as TVs, games, laptops, etc. I had to learn how to activate phones and put out freight. I love working with the associates at Wal-Mart. Some days would be busy and other times it would be slow or steady. I believe the hardest part of the job is having to work in the electronics department by yourself until overnight associates came into work. I believe the enjoyable part is working with my customers and having customers giving my managers great compliments on how well I was able to help them with their problem.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Colonial Heights, VA",5/28/15,2015,5,28
Poor work environment,"Walmart believes that large amounts of work can be done with minimal personnel. While the company guidelines say that they are supportive of their workers, they are not, often employees are encouraged to work over and the next week your hours are cut to balance the time. Management is encouraged to constantly monitor and berate employees in an attempt to squeeze more work. As a department manager I worked very hard in my area and once the store and my department passed the yearly audit, our promised bonus was never received and later the store manager said he used it to but an ice machine!

"Decent, but not worth the pay","Usually your day will consist of long line's because there supposedly aren't enough hours to go around and management is pretty nice depending on who your manager is, co-workers are friendly also depending on who you get involved with and some co-workers aren't so good, another downfall of the job is the customers along with price matching. I know that most customers complain about the wait in line before checking out which is nothing i can do about. But there's always a time that after a good amount of time of waiting they will get to the check out and not have their wallet or not know how much money they have or leave the rest of their items because they didn't calculate how much everything cost. Also there are some who take an maximum advantage on the price matching policy by just throwing in low price numbers that doesn't break the barrier for the employee to ask for an ad. But i would say the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Stock ,"Waukegan, IL",5/28/15,2015,5,28

"Diverse work environment, with many opportunities for advancement","In an average day working as an Asset Protection Associate, I come into work and check my e-mail to begin my shift.

I then perform a security walk through each department on the salesfloor, checking for merchandise protection consistency and correcting any items that need attention, looking for safety concerns and correcting those as well. After walking the salesfloor, I then check the backroom for any inconsistencies in binning and processing, safety, and to ensure the security and unloading doors are locked. After my morning walk, I fill out the necessary reports to document my findings and handle any other tasks that need to be worked.  Some days I also lead safety tours for the new hires, and conduct safety team meetings.

I know people say that Wal-Mart is a horrible place to work but each store is very different from one another which means that individual experiences can vary a lot. The effectiveness of management also varies from store to store. I'd say the managers in my store were decent. They weren't bad or great either but good enough. Its a good job for a teen, someone starting out, or a person who wants experience in customer service but its definitely not something  to make a career out of. Customers are difficult and can be down right horrible sometimes no matter what store you work in and in some stores even the management is horrible. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers (the things some people will tell you) and also your coworkers. The hardest part is dealing with irate customers.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Normal, IL",5/26/15,2015,5,26

good if you cant get anything else but otherwise no,Walmart will hire almost anyone. As a sales associate or cashier. You have to be young and dumb to be promoted into management so hopes for working your way up after about 33 are nonsense._x000D_The discount card is a little help and if you need to buy groceries and go home you can do it right there.

We were not told about policy changes or updates to our register and because of this we were sent in blind to provide customer service without the necessary tools we needed. We were not provided with the basic cleaning tools such as cleaning spray or paper towels but we were constantly told to clean. We were told to put away items that customers no longer wanted at the same time we were told to never leave our registers. _x000D_     These kinds of conflicting orders were relentless, they were the norm. Every day we had to figure out what order to disobey, which one would get us the least trouble. My co-workers and I lived in constant fear that we would recieve a coaching (a demerit of sorts) and possibly worse retribution. Favoritism runs rampant in this company. If you're a favorite you get to ignore the rules of the company, while others who perform excellent customer service are persecuted because they don't beg for favor.

"Walmart Distribution Center: Great Company Culture, Great Compensation And Benefits, However They Did Stick To What Was Promised.","I was given an extremely fulfilling opportunity to work for this company.  I signed up through Fresno State's business school internship office.  While I was an intern, I was compensated quite favorably and also given a full time schedule.  The first few weeks were spent on strictly training me on how freight flows through the facility.  After training, for eight weeks I was assigned two associates who I lead in an auditing project of two major departments.  I was given a fair amount of leeway on how to manage the project.  As we came across an error, it was my duty to determine why the error occurred, fix the error, utilize reports, and create accountability for the associate who created the error.  At the end of the project, I presented my results, findings, and recommendations to senior management.  I truly enjoyed working for the company.  I was given respect, opportunity to enroll in benefits, and was treated as a manager for the entirety of my employment.  I was told that a management position would be open at the conclusion of my internship, but two days before it ended I was informed that there weren't in fact any open positions.  While I absolutely loved every minute of working here and put my heart and soul into this project (in hopes of gaining respect), I was quite surprised and disappointed by the outcome.

The most enjoyable part of the job were meeting new customers daily.,5,Former Employee,Pharmacy Associate ,"Florence, SC",5/21/15,2015,5,21
"Can be very challenging, but reqarding","A customer support person should respond quickly to satisfy the customer and understand their situation.  You must be able to evaluate information, and handle questions and complaints to communicate clearly, both in writing and orally as well as speak in a way people can understand.  It is important to have a “thick skin” and be able to handle complaints, especially when handling unpleasant customers.  You may be responsible for keeping records of customer interactions and transactions, recording details of questions, complaints, comments, as well as the actions taken.  You should follow-up and make sure appropriate changes were made to resolve the customer’s problems.  Accuracy and an eye for detail will help you handle matters in the best interest of both the customer and the company.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Minden, LA/ Dallas, TX",5/21/15,2015,5,21

Fun Meeting New People and Building lasting relationships,Wal-Mart was great. Its one of the few places where you worked your shift and didn't have to leave to go pick up groceries from another store. It was literally a one-stop-shop. You work and then shop. Loved it. The only downfall was that I couldn't take care of a family of five on a Wal-Mart salary even when being a Manager.,4,Former Employee,Manager ,Bastrop Louisiana,5/21/15,2015,5,21

poor environment,"Employees are not valued as part of a team and creating a relationship among employees is not encouraged.

Day to Day,Working at Wal-Mart was something interesting and something I chose to do because I was able to work with others. I did not truthfully care for the management and the way many people would call off of work and the lack of help. I would arrive to work and go clock in after I placed my belongings in the locker. I would make sure my badge and other items were correctly in place and proceed to my destination. I would always greet my customers with a smile and allow myself the ability to make small talk with them to ensure they found everything okay. I learned that working with others is important and being positive is important as well. I had a few managers that were extremely rude and disrespectful. Coworkers are a major part of your day to day actions. I had many that made the day easy and we were able to work together. I did not like being the cashier that had to always depend on my managers to give me change and or override a customers transaction. I loved when customers would allow me to help them find certain items.,4,Former Employee,Cashier/Manager ,"Fort Worth, TX",5/21/15,2015,5,21

"To Many Chiefs, Not Enough Indians","If you would like to succed at wal-mart and make good money, the only way is management.

Stable Job. Very selective with advancement.,"With my time at Walmart (1.5yrs) I was offered management three times. I was denied every time because I was ""too immature"" or they thought I was ""unprepared"". What it came down to was I was fully qualified but 19 years old.

Not what you would expect from Walmart,"The night shifts were fun and fast paced. I learned how to stock, do inventory, use system handhelds. The management was really strict and did not have much direction. In other words, they were strict but they were not sure why. They would bother the employees for no apparent reason just to see we were all going above and beyond with our work. My coworkers were all amazing. Everyone would do their best to make sure every single thing was done every night, and that was not easy. The hardest job was abiding by the time expectations. For example, I would have 8 hours of freight in one aisle and they would expect me to be finished in 2 hours.

Good place to start out.,"Being a cashier at Walmart is what I assume is typical of many retail positions.  There are a couple days of training (less if you're already experienced) and after that days get pretty typical quickly.  I worked mostly 8 hour days in which I arrived and punched in, and worked registers in two hour spurts with 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch in between.  On occasion I would be instructed to re-shelve returned items, which we called ""go-backs.""  This broke up the monotony of register work.  During those times I also sort of doubled as a sales associate, assisting customers with the prices and locations of products while I re-shelved and organized items._x000D_Management differs in Walmart from store to store, but I was lucky enough to have a very personable and understanding group of supervisors and managers in my store.  Good managers are essential to making the jobs of the lowest level workers bearable, so if you choose to work at Walmart I recommend getting a feel of the management before accepting a job._x000D_The most difficult part of my job wasn't the job itself, but my hours.  Humans do not set your work hours.  Instead, your availability is put into a computer and the computer sets your hours at any time within that availability, up to 8 hours.  If you cannot or will not work for 8 hours in a day, I highly recommend that you do NOT set your availability over more than an 8 hour range.  If you want a consistent work schedule, indicate specific hours that you want to work._x000D_Co-workers are another grab bag.  They depend on what store you work at.

I witnessed a medical emergency in the parking lot, and I told management and they didn't do anything they just said oh well. Someone else had to call the cops.

The management is down to Earth, the Supervisors for the most part are very professional and keep their departments handled well. They give bonuses based on store performance. They also provide picnics for the employees as well as catered meals during the holidays. You also get a 10% discount card to use on just about anything in the store.

"Beware, rare promotions, bad pay, etc. etc. etc.","The work is generally easy, but for me I was doing the work of 2 people.  I handled the chemicals department and stocked it each night.  I also was in charge of the jewelry department.  It was on the other end of the store and every time a customer needed something I had to run there to take care of it.  I wouldn't have complained but I got no extra compensation and was expected to finish my work each night even if jewelry was busy.  I also was a spare cashier if they got busy.  Again, no extra compensation and had to finish my work each night--no excuses.  Some nights I spent half my shift at jewelry and cashiering and no one gave me any slack.  I got no promotions or merit raises even though I was constantly given positive feedback from management.  If I hadn't worked overnight the pay would not have been worth the job.  It really wasn't worth it anyway.  I've worked jobs half as difficult for more money than what Walmart pays.  It was difficult to get time off for any reason.  After getting an emergency tooth pulling at the dentist, I was told I had to come in the next day or get fired.  So I worked my shift with gauze in my mouth all night and didn't eat because of the gross bloody gauze.  During my orientation a manager gave me and the others who were orientating pamphlets for government assistance because, you know, their benefits are unattainable for the money you make.  If you're a lady, don't bet on getting promoted, ever.  Few women in management at the store I was at.  New management positions were given to outsiders.  It's complete bull that they promote from within. - more...",1,Former Employee,Cashier and Stocker ,"Baraboo, WI",5/18/15,2015,5,18

"Good job, but I would not recommend it.","Working at Walmart  was a job that I would work at, but only for a short time like during the summer. I was not a job that I would want to work at again. A typical day at Walmart would consist of me checking in and going straight to a register to check the items that the customers were going to be paying for.  My co-workers were friendly people. I got along with them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. I always kept a positive attitude regardless of what was going on. Sometimes the customers would have problems with the service provided to them and they would take their anger out on me by ranting or saying some words that shouldn't have been said. Even through that, I still kept my positive and polite attitude. Honestly, the most enjoyable part of this job was clocking out and going home.

When I got initially hired, I was supposed to work three on and three off needless to say, before I completed the Assistant Mangers Training they changed that in the middle of my class.

If you're full-time the benefits aren't so bad, but if you're part time good luck getting them! They will work you just under the max for benefits to avoid giving you any OR they will cut you drastically one week to balance it out. Not only is store management a joke so is district and up. Wal-Mart will cut you down to two employees, I have literally seen two employees for an entire side of a store, and expect you to get the work of 10 done.

Productive and fun workplace,"A typical day at work in WalMart is clocking in, finding your department, stocking the shelves, helping customers, going to lunch, repeat, and clock out. What I learned at WalMart is that you don't get your personal life get intertwined with your work life. The management was pretty good, I liked them. They were very easy to talk to and understood different situations you may be going through. My co-workers were literally THE BEST! There wasn't a night that went by thatI didn't get along with them. The hardest part about the job would probably have to be how much freight would come in and who would be covering the department. Sometimes it would be too much of a heavy load for just one person.The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer was happy with the service they were provided. There were many older people that would come in and actually might just need someone to talk to.",5,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Stocker ,"York, PA",5/15/15,2015,5,15

Not the best company to work for,"Working at Walmart was definitely an experience. Most of my coworkers were great people and we were like a family. Being in a management position at Walmart involves being overworked and over extended on a daily basis. There was never enough help and most managers are required to do the work of 5 people in a regular 40 hour week. Although I found this to be difficult, I rose to the challenge and succeeded. The trouble was the harder one worked, the more work would get thrown at you and nothing was ever appreciated.",3,Former Employee,Marketing Specialist and Department Manager ,"Cedar Knolls, NJ",5/15/15,2015,5,15
Fun place to work,"A typical day at work consisted of me greeting customers, checking customers out, keeping aisles neat and tidy, stocking merchandise and rotating merchandise and bagging customers items. I would talk to all the customers and ask them about their day and be friendly.

The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know the customers on a personal level so that the next time I seen them come in, I could ask about more specific things and make them feel special because I remembered them.",4,Former Employee,Seasonal Cashier ,"Granite Falls, NC",5/15/15,2015,5,15
