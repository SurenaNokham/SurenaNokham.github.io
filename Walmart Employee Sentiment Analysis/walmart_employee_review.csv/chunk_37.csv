productive,"Each day I do my objectives in order and listen to the Customer Service Management (CSM). At 11PM we usually get a large wave of customers while the day cashiers clock out, so we all check out customers as fast as we can. As we check out each customer we watch each other to watch if anyone needs assistance. Afterwards we collect stray items around the store and place them in their correct areas. Afterwards we stock candy or zone for the rest of the morning. _x000D_Management is always watching in case we need more cashiers if the lines are too long, the CSM in charge of cashiers is in the cash office or collecting money from registers until midnight. Other than watching us we do not see them unless the buy food for lunch. My co-workers never stray from their task, and take charge when needed. However there is a lot of favoritism, which is the same as any job._x000D_The hardest part at night is the CSM disappearing when someone needs a key or if we need a manager for a frustrated customer.

Walmart's chokehold,"Walmart was just as bad as they're reviews. i loved the customers and my fellow employees even the work of stocking shelves was cool but, The Management is disappointing, if i could sum them up in a few words i would say cowardly, Demeaning, and unorganized.

Walmart has a definite place in American business practices.,"Attitude is a choice, and each day is a new day, not to be repeated or confused with the day before.  While working at Walmart, I learned to go to meet and welcome customers if given the chance. Keeping a clean, neat register environment was personally important to me.  Even though I've been a satisfied housewife with a husband that provided well, it is now time for me to return to the workplace and pull my weight, as he has come down with Parkinson's Disease and it is hard to live on a fixed ssa income.  Generally managers at Walmart were good people that wanted the best for the store, and a good reflection on their on efforts to excel in management. Give them the best you have, be honest and straightforward, and I found them to be reasonable managers for the most part.  Unfortunately, one morning my foot slipped on the old wooden stairs at home, and I plunged down the stairs suffering a really bad hip fracture. It has healed well and I definitely am ready to return to work and be the best cashier I can be.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Richmond, MO",1/7/15,2015,1,7

"Ok to work for but ""very stingy"" with pay",Working for Walmart is OK on a personal level and does offer benefits such as medical that are otherwise difficult for people to get but offers little to those of us that have leadership experience and/or a higher education. Walmart has shown me that they are all about running their associates and management ragged for minimal compensation. Like most retailers these days Walmart talks about how they hire veterans what they don't talk about is how they insult veterans & especially educated veterans by offering minimum wage or just above minimum wage to start which does not pay the bills for anyone!!!,2,Former Employee,Product Assembler ,"Niceville, FL",1/7/15,2015,1,7

Friendly work environment,"A typical day at Walmart as a cashier would consist of checking customers out and scanning coupons for them and helping them achieve whatever budget they had. I learned a lot while I was working there even if it was for a short period of time, I learned that not every customer will be nice to you and you have to put up with that and get over it even if it means your feelings are hurt, I learned that sometimes cash registers can mess up too, not just the cashier, I learned that it's okay to make a few mistakes as long as it doesn't happen too often, I learned that if you're late it'll be counted against you and you'll have to work harder to prove your worth to your managers, but most importantly I learned how to make friends and be more happy. My management team was very loving and caring and helpful except for a few people who were just downright nasty with me and told me things that I already knew, which degraded me a little but I got over it. My coworkers were very helpful as well, helping me look up produce codes and helping me bag the merchandise and sometimes removing security tags when I was having trouble and I really appreciated my coworkers a lot and to this day we're friends and hanging around each other a lot. The hardest part about working at Walmart is that they expect too much from you and they want you to over-compensate your abilities and sometimes it's overwhelming for one person.

Such as life threatening situations with my associates. Once I do my part, I expect for them to follow up and do theirs. The best part about my job is making my workers happy because if they aren't happy, you can't expect for your department to show improvement if your workers aren't happy first. They learn from me so I have to set the example for them to be great.",3,Current Employee,Merchandising Supervisor ,"Burlington, NC",1/4/15,2015,1,4

"Some of the management are very unproductive, breaks is when they ever they like sending you or when your done with your task.","I would say working at Walmart is not fun to work at, managers are so rude and mean to the employment they don't have empathy or sympathy when your hurt or sick they won't even send you home no matter how sick you are not unless you passed out.  It is very rare for Walmart to have a nice manager.  You just want  to work that company because you have bills to pay some co-workers are nice.

Poor management,The demands from staff are not physically possible for any human to achieve which brings the entire store moral down. Co workers do what the can and often try to do the impossible. Often hard to come too work knowing it couldn't be done. Attendance point system not entirely affective in weeding out the habitual absent person.

Over nights is a no!,"When I was working overnights, It took a while to get used to actually doing over nights. After a week or two I got used to it, but this wasn't the bad part. When I was working here, I only got one day of training, while a girl who started the same day as me got about three or four. They always switched my area after I got used to one, and would expect me to get the new area done in an hour, when I have never been in that section before, How can someone do that??? It's not that easy to find things you are looking for all the time!! Then when I was in the lanes stocking some shelves, I had the cart in there with me, this lady that works their was always very cranky with me for some reason, she was actually the one who trained me, and told me I had to take the carts out of the lanes. So I took the one I was working on out. I went and asked her if I had to take them all out. And in a snappy attitude she says ""well yeah its one of the first things you learn in you cbl's didn't you watch them?"" which to me was very rude because I was just asking a simple question. The management you could never seem to find when you needed them.

"Overall Nice, and fun place to work.","This is a pretty good company to work for. My only complaint is their attendance policy needs revised it is very strict. In order to get an approved missed day of work to go to the hospital for something then they have to admit you. So, if you get in an accident and have to go to the hospital and they don't admit you, you will be counted as absent from work that day! The management is very good, the people you will work with are great, and the pay is better then most retail.

A stable job but with not much advancement opportunities.,"Working for Wal-Mart for close to 5 years now has been a worthwhile experience and enabled me to strongly work within a busy and demanding environment while dealing with the public.  It is a joy working and helping customers, however, there are some criticisms with the overall lack of structure in the store I work in, and ultimately being locked into part-time for so long isn't very ideal in this stage of my life.

My over all view of my time at Wal-mart,"It was a good work environment that taught me team work, time management and hard work. We worked as a family to make sure that customers were taken care of and that each associate was able to accomplish any task given. A typical night started with a meeting to inform the staff of any changed and to give us details on what the night had in store of us. We would then one by one check on the computers, using out badges, so see what area we would be working. From there each associate would go and get their assigned freight load for the night from the back room and begin stocking it to the shelves. Once an item was opened if it had disposable material to it, such as coming in a box or plastic, it would be placed in a cart. Once the cart was filled the associate would take it to the back and place cardboard in a baler and plastic in a recycle bin, After freight was thrown each isle would be zoned, products pulled forward, and made clear of all messes not earlier addressed. The hard parts of the night were mostly keeping up with stocking while helping all needing customers find requested items but it was only a small time delay where keeping isles clean was a little harder of a time struggle.",4,Former Employee,Associate ,"Pineville, MO",1/2/15,2015,1,2

They were always pretty good with me about needing time off for my kids and usually willing to work with me if I needed shift changes. I'd say about half of the management was enjoyable to work with. The other half was your typical power hungry personnel who don't know how to properly manage without putting people down.

"Tricky and Competitive Workplace, Tons Of Gossip","What I learned working at Wal-Mart is the only way to become heard is to voice your opinions to management; keep to yourself at all times. Work is work, keep your personal life stories to family and friends outside of work. A job is something that is business orientated, you must be professional and ignore persistent gossip, because thats all it is are rumors and unimportant stories that will hold you back, so I learned to push through that, and because of that I became a better worker, to the point where i was offered a promotion as a Customer Service Rep._x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job was leaving, despite all the hard times I went through working at Wal-Mart, I felt lively when working there, it made me feel needed!

Every time I had any question or requested time off they gave it to me. Most of my co-workers are also pretty good, however a few of them are lazy.

Not a glowing review. But the truth is the truth.,"There is a lot of demand at this job and little praise. A typical night starts with clocking in and down stocking the merchandise. After that  its involves working in ones aisle putting up the products in proper places until around four-thirty-five. After that is zoning for the rest of the shift. I find my coworkers to be fairly reasonable and easy to get along with. There are three breaks- two fifteen minutes and a hour lunch. _x000D_the most difficult part of the job is keeping up with what the managers want. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but we're extremely understaffed; thus more demands are placed on us to cover the areas that are lacking. _x000D__x000D_As for the managers- most of them seem to think that the best way to motivate us is by yelling and threatening to fire us.

Terrible Place to Work,"I have never hated working anywhere before I worked at Walmart. I had a pre-existing medical condition in which I had to take injections that made me sick. I asked for two off days together not caring which days it was, but they would never give it to me. They changed my schedule every week. That would have been fine if I wasn't having to take injections. I can work and I can work hard, but the two days after my injection, I was very sick. Walmart did not care and would not take doctor's excuses or letters from the doctor. I ended up having to quit just so I wouldn't get fired. Maybe it would have been better to get fired and then take it to court or something. Management at the Hueytown location was awful! They acted like all the other employees were low lifes.

Fun and fast paced workplace,A typical day for me was running a register and keeping an eye out for customers who needed help getting checked out or needed help finding something.  We got a break every hour and a half to about 3 hours in depending on how many hours you worked that day.  I learned how to run the register and clean up any mess that I might run across while I was working.  Everyone I worked with was nice and would help you if you had any problems while working.  They were also strict about the rules you had to follow while working.

My one and only horror story in all my working life.,Walmart is a great place to shop. I do not recommend employment here however. Management is seriously lacking. It is my opinion that Walmart is just so large that many things fall through the cracks. Management in this particular Walmart is in serious trouble. They see problems and issues yet do nothing to fix or even address them. They teach safety but do not uphold to it. My position in ICS was a dangerous one each and every day. I was put into positions that management could have corrected but instead turned the other way. Management did however caution me to be careful. I left Walmart because my safety was in question every day. I felt I needed to put myself in a better environment.,1,Former Employee,ICS ,"Washington, UT",12/29/14,2014,12,29

It's difficult being a cashier anywhere, not because the actual job is hard, but because it's a challenge pleasing everyone that comes down that line. At the end of the day, after being yelled at, insulted, and disrespected, it's hard to find anything worthwhile or enjoyable but I found that my coworkers and the friendly atmosphere makes all the trouble worth it. I know that if I need help I can call my CSM or the closest cashier and they'll help me just like I'll help them.

A day in the retail life.,A typical day as an assistant manager at Walmart started with our morning meetings. Our store manager gave us our daily notes and what to complete for the work day and what was left from the day before. We then would gather the information and delegate it accordingly. Through out the day follow up make sure everything was going smoothly while taking care of our associates and customers. Of course we would also take care of anything else that came up during the day as well. We would meet up several more times for followup meetings making sure everything was getting done. The hardest part was having enough associates to complete the task or having too much put upon our associates. The job taught me a lot I appreciated my associates so much they worked very hard for me no matter how hard the situation. I loved helping them in return however when I did I was reprimanded for that which I didn't like about the job I feel if they work hard for me im going to go the extra mile for them.

"Fun, fast-paced work environment. Great for customer service experiences.","A typical day at work is fast paced. I love to work in a fast paced environment because it allows me to work harder. Nobody likes a slow work life. What I've learned so far working for Wal-Mart is that sometimes work can get so stressful that you want to quit, but hard work and dedication everyday will make work more easier in the end. I've learned to cope with different peoples attitudes and management. Some of the managers can be a pain, but its only because they really believe in you as a worker and would like to see you succeed in the company. The co-workers there are somewhat helpful. A majority are new due to the holiday hire. But for those who have been there for sometime, they are the true associates who you can count on to get the job done right. The hardest part about the job is working with associates who don't have the same work drive as I do. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to get your assigned work done, shelves stocked and zoned, and our re-shops back on the shelves well before the shift is over. That shows drive in my eyes.",5,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Charlotte, NC",12/24/14,2014,12,24
Why Walmart,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of making sure we had enough registers open to accommodate our customers, balancing breaks, lunches, cashiers calling in sick, and maintaining a seamless transition throughout the day. I learned that no matter how hard we tried to do our jobs, management was always knocking us down. They were not supportive, nor were they trustworthy. There are policies in place for a reason and management seemed to pick and choose which ones they would abide by depending on the day, the customer or the situation. That hardest part of the job was firing an associate for misconduct. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually helping the customers no matter if they were irate, happy or confused.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Antioch, IL",12/24/14,2014,12,24

very counter productive,"I was an employee of Walmart  and it was the worst experienced place I worked for. Walmart lies, cheats, and abuses their associates. I faced harassment from one of the Assistant Managers and nothing was ever done about it. I was accused of editing my time when in fact I more than likely cheated myself out of time. Management needs to show more respect to their associates and listen to them. To be honest actually, Walmart did me a huge favor and I will never work for this company again. Treat your people right, pay them more than what you do, and maybe give more to their bonuses. I mean really, they are doing the work while you sit up on your Walmart throne earning the living that the associates deserve.",2,Former Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Moraine, OH",12/24/14,2014,12,24

Professional and rigid,"Walmart is a well-established company with many rules. When I clocked in, I would go straight to my area of work and find the list of tasks my manager had left for me. Tasks were specific, daily tasks that changed from day to day, and general tasks that were performed daily. After assessing my tasks for the day, I would begin with what my manager had instructed me to do. I learned that I am only required to do as asked and it doesn't always have to make sense to me. At Walmart, I had 5 different managers in the course of my time there. Some were fantastic, some got themselves fired for breaking rules. When I had a clear set of instructions, my day went smoothly. The hardest part of working as a stocker is helping customers while finishing all the stocking tasks of the day.

"A good starting place, but little to no future.","On a typical day, working in Electronics, I would generally have to handle everything from helping customers, attempting sales loosely (no commission but expected), handling merchandise such as stocking (or cleaning up overstock other associates created), binning overstocked or excessive merchandise, handling dot.com in store orders (both pick ups and processing), setting and resetting expired modular (merchandise sections), wireless sales (both prepaid and contract), wireless set up and technical support, basic photo center coverage, and anything extra asked of me throughout the store (helping in other departments, cashiering up front, carrying or moving heavy items (in some cases alone when needing a team lift)._x000D__x000D_The best part of the job is learning your department and gaining experience in sales and customer service.

My typical day at work involved me stocking shelves, but it was never boring because my co-workers and I also had to help customers as a part of our job, which is satisfying if you are someone who loves to help people. The hardest parts of my job was the fact that I was very tired after work and that the job security of being a temporary associate and the pay rate is sub par if this is your only source of income. Luckily for me I had my husband to bring in the income we needed to survive, but if that weren't the case then the pay rate and lack of job security would have been a big source of complaint.

Depends on the Individual,"Some people can work at Walmart for years; what it takes to do that is ignoring the nonsense in the way the company is ran. There is an overall lack of communication and lack of hard working associates and some management. The good things about working for Walmart is that they are flexible with your school schedule and most managers are understanding to and emergencies, especially if you are a good worker. Working for Walmart is also a store by store experience. Every story differs, it all boils down to management. Having a few good managers on the whole team can't save the whole store. Co-workers like to talk, but are supportive, in most cases. Day to day experience is coming in hunting for a jack, telxon, printer, removing pallets of freight from the backroom area where i downstack pallets. after pallets are downstacked (usally 2 hour process depending on amount of freight) bakery pallets are taken to bakery freezer, meat pallets to meat freezer, and the remaining pallets for the three isles and one bunker that frozen team works are worked one at a time. There are usally 5-6 pallets to be worked at the end of breakdown process, and likely another pallet of picks coming to be worked. Severe overstocking of the shelves makes it difficult to throw new merchandise, but with time you figure it out. after stocking each pallet it is then binned into inventory in the backroom, frozen team usually has to do this for themselves because "" there aren't enough backroom associates"" to do it. But in reality there are , nobody likes working in the freezer so we often times take on extra responsibilities. - more...",3,Current Employee,Overnight Dairy-Meat-Frozen Stocker ,"Kansas City, MO",12/18/14,2014,12,18

Otherwise, the location I worked at was a great place to work, everyone was friendly, felt like a family atmosphere. I do feel like they weren't open to correcting some of the operations that were ""broken"" that would have made the job easier and more efficient/profitable. New management came in shortly before I left and I would predict some positive changes. Most of management was always kind and helpful, but I did ask for a transfer into a different department a few weeks into my job after realizing I had lifting restrictions and they were never able to transfer me.

Horrible Company,I worked here for 13 years and then Walmart started cutting my hours and took my benefits away. The management was heartless and the upper management was even worse. I dedicated 13 years of my life to Walmart and I left with nothing.,1,Former Employee,Wal Mart In-Store Technician ,Abilene Texas,12/12/14,2014,12,12

Different everyday,"I worked in the cash office, customer service, cashier, and on the floor. I worked overnight for a while unloading and loading the trucks. I guess you can say I did it all. I worked with a lot of people and some I'm still friends with today. I was offered to move up a few times but in that point in my life it wasn't something I could take on. I loved going to work everyday because you never knew what was going to happen and the day I left was so sad but I had a child who had medical problems at the time and I would have to be in Houston in a hospital with him for a few months.",5,Former Employee,"Customer Service, Cash Office ","San Antonio, TX",12/12/14,2014,12,12

Each day was a challenge because the modulars would totally flip around. We always worked as ateam. If needed some members of management would assist us.The associates were friendly for the most part and helpful. I would say doing a modular reset was the hardest pat of the job. We would have to sit down and estimate how long it would take to complete, as welltry to find the materials needed to complete the job.

The pay rate is very low for the job you done,"All the advertisement and the benefits the Walmart companies they have to offer their employees are not really easy to have. Miscommunications between managements and employees are unbelievable huge. The pay rate is so low for the amount of work you done at the store.

"A good job, unfulfilling career.",I cannot speak for the company as a whole as I have only worked at one store.   While the pay and benefits are decent it feels as if employees and even store management are less able to make a change in the workplace than the store would try to have its employees believe.

WalMart is a great place to work with opportunities  for advancement.,"Very busy day at a fast pace, people centered environment. Hard work but rewarding in that you never would have to go to the gym if you did the work required. Management would have the duties for the day and together we would accomplish everything on the list. I enjoyed working with my co-workers many of them young people who respected my work ethic and my friendly attitude. Most of them keep in contact with me today and value my opinion and life experiences.

Walmart,"The day starts with opening the vision center up, counting the cash register, unlocking the cabinets and turning on and calibrating equipment. I answered phones making appointments for the independent doctor of optometry and reminding patients of their appointments and expiring prescriptions. I learned a lot working this job. Customer service, managing others, schedules, mark downs, and new skills.The management team was not really apart of the decision making in the vision center. I had the market health and wellness director over me. My co-workers liked me as a boss. They worked together with me as team! The hardest part of the job is to make the customer happy all the time.

After I do picks or stock the floor._x000D_Manegment doesnt like to move you up if your good at what you do. My co-workers were very lazy and did not like to work at the same level as me.

The only enjoyable part of the job was the pay and benefits.",1,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,Shreveport LA,12/11/14,2014,12,11
It depends which location you work at,My time in Walmart was great at first until I gotten to know more about management better and how they ran things along with the associates who didn't seem to take pride in their work and are there for just a paycheck. The hardest part about the job was trying to finish projects or tasks before the end of your shift and usually the store I worked at had rushes every day between 11 am to 3 pm. The most enjoyable part about the job is when things go smoothly and all there is left to do is clock out.,3,Former Employee,Department Mangaer ,"Thornton, CO",12/11/14,2014,12,11

Very hostile workplace,Each day I would go in and start cooking to fill the hot bar. Then I would start on freight for either the deli or bakery.

Good place to start working,"I started working overnight as part of the maintenance crew, but after a couple of months I was allowed to move to the cash office. Here I was in charge of balancing the teller drawers and resetting them for the next day. Also created cash shipments to be deposited and made sure that orders for cash were made to replenish the teller bags. This is the first place I furthered my knowledge of cleaning by striping and waxing floors. I learned how a full retail store needs to operate and the many cogs that keep it going which are vital. Managers here always welcomed new talent and would normally give you a chance if you asked to be moved to another department. Working overnights takes a special kind of person and they were plenty of them on that shift. The hardest part was first learning to work overnight and still being able to have a social life. It took some time but eventually a routine developed and I found myself being able to go to school and still work full-time. I enjoyed working at different departments.",3,Former Employee,Accounting Clerk ,"Las Vegas, Nv",12/11/14,2014,12,11

Overload of hard work and high expectations,"Working at Walmart the typical day I observed the day workers didn't work as hard as the overnight shift.

Overnight is a terrible enough schedule, but pile on: manager changes, extra work load, gossipy co-workers, constant critiques and unbalanced work load between co-workers, and you have a living nightmare.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Santa Fe, NM",12/8/14,2014,12,8

"Gossip, varying customers, patience","At Walmart a typical day would consist of at least two customers who'd be unsatisfied with the way things were run in the back, or with other cashiers. Generally I'd try to appease those customers, and explain the workings of things, thereby excusing their frustration and the behavior of those in the back. I learnt that a customer service provider such as myself needs to be extremely patient by nature, for it is simply impossible to continuously forge understanding. I believe I possess that quality. I learnt at Walmart that your direct supervisors are not trying to diminish your efforts, they simply get orders from corporate, and have their own struggles to get through. One way of helping them being a better supervisor is being a better employee. The most enjoyable part of that job was definitely seeing a customer's smile at the end of a transaction.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Stockbridge, GA",12/8/14,2014,12,8

"Great benefits, terrible management","Overall experience at this store is mixed. While the people and the benefits are good, the bad management can be hard to ignore._x000D__x000D_The pay is hard to beat, starting at a minimum of $10.00 per hour, even for a staring position like a cart pusher, though most people start even higher than that( starting pay is store specific). Benefits for full-time employees include awesome health insurance(medical, dental, vision) as well as other lesser known benefits, like a 20% discount for Verizon customers. You get the sense that at the corporate level, they do try and keep their associates happy. _x000D__x000D_My co-workers were possibly the best part of the job. I worked with many wonderful, talented, and educated people, some of which have become life-long friends._x000D__x000D_I wish I could say the same for our management team. In almost four years we have gone through three different Store Managers, and by my last count eleven assistants. High-turnover and lack of good leadership means lots of confusion and headaches for everyone not taking home a salary. In one day, I can have five different people above me with five different objectives for the eight hours I work. I've actually been told if you want to move up in this store, you will lose hair, sleep, time with your loved ones, and will probably develop an ulcer from the stress and coffee consumption.  _x000D__x000D_If you're thinking about moving up in the company and becoming a department manager or any other first level manager, make sure to have a bottle of something strong waiting for you at home.

It is a job,A lot of customers or not very many at all. Usually one way or the other. You had to keep yourself busy at all times whether you had customers or not. That could sometimes be a problem. I learned how much I like meeting new people and polishing my customer service skills. And I learned how to make an angry customer happy or try to. Management usually doesn't appreciate the workers very much and are always making sure you stay busy. I loved my co-workers and we got along and helped each other out. Hardest part of the job was when something didn't ring up right or didn't have a bar code on it. Also when a customer is very unhappy and is letting you know about it wanting you to do something that only a person in higher authority is allowed to do. Meeting new people and having return customers come through your line.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Vernon, TX",12/5/14,2014,12,5
things about walmart,"A typical day at work started with checking in with the management to see where they wanted the employees.

My Typical Day At Work,"My typical day at work involved a great deal of physical work pushing carts by hand, helping customers with carry outs where I would carry out heavy items like beds, swimming pools, loads of plant food or fertilizer. I also dealt directly with the public each day because I was the first employee customers would encounter due to working in the parking lot. So I would always greet customers with a ""Hi, how are you doing?"" to make them feel welcome. I would also ask customers if they would like me to help load heavy items like cases  of water or soda or large bags of cat and dog food, especially the senior aged customers. Things I learned were how to make people happy with simple acts of kindness like greeting them and asking them if I could help them load their heavy grocery items. I also learned better communication skills with my co workers due to being the cart pusher float, I had to co-ordinate lunches and breaks between the cart pushers on both sides of the parking lot. It was my job to cover their sides during lunches and breaks. I also learned how to be flexible under varying work conditions and situations. I did my job without complaint as well.

"Great work environment, I enjoy working with the public.","A typical work day would be me clocking in as soon as I arrive.  I would then scan my work badge so I can be assigned to a register, and then make my way to that particular register.  I would then log onto that register and began to check out customers.  Depending on the amount of hours I've been scheduled to work determines the remainder of my day.  Some days I'll take an hour lunch break, and some days I'll only take a fifteen minute break.  Then when its time for me to end my work day and clock out, I clean around my register, sweep, and change the trash bag.  I then clock out and throw my trash away and go home.  The best part of my job is the people I work with.  Unless I'm sick, I often have fun at work.  Management sucks.  When there are big events (holidays, black friday) going on at the store, there is no type of control or order.  We as cashiers try and do our best to keep things under control, but I just feel things could be handled in a much better way.

Eh...how to put this,"I will admit, I have worked at a different wal-mart where I would rate it five stars overall.  the one in Ruckersville, Va is barely worth the two star rating.  Most of the management there believe that they are better than everyone else.  They are lazy and will not even make the schedules, they let the computer generate them.  They refuse to change days that associates need off or need adjusted, but quickly adjust the schedule when they need it adjusted.  Some refuse to talk with associates about important matters and shrug them off.  The store is extremely cluttered and unorganized.  Some managers are very nice and try to help associates as much as they can, however most do not.  The other associates are nice and all try to help one another.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier/Customer Service ,"Ruckersville, VA",12/3/14,2014,12,3

It's a great place to work if you like a safe job with routines.,"Each day you'll clock in, go to the daily meeting, and do the walmart cheer. Then you'll do you daily duties, for a night-time stocker, your freight is normally already pulled out for you. You stock for two hours, go to paid break, stock for two more hours, take an hour long lunch, come back, stock for two more hours, take your last break, and finish your freight. Your required to put away returned merchandise, and picks(overstock from prior days). you must also zone your area(line everything neatly on the shelves so your area looks fully stocked). while doing your duties, it is, in my opinion, extremely important to make sure the customers are finding what they need, some don't feel the same way and the 10 foot rule is not enforced. Management has a lot on their plates and they work very hard, you must do your best to work safely and solve problems on your own as much as you can, however no one will blame you if you need help. so if you don't know something don't hesitate to ask. it is not a hard job there is just a lot of multitasking involved, so don't get stressed and you'll be fine. my favorite thing about stocking is that there is always work so time goes by extremely fast.",3,Former Employee,night stocker ,"Chandler, AZ",11/30/14,2014,11,30

Coworkers were great to be around. My problem other than management was being told by the maintenance manager that I was pushing the dirt and dust the wrong way when I was sweeping the floor.

Fun and Balanced Work place,"A typical work day would include, answering customer phone calls, putting away returns in apparel, working inventory and each day do recovery.

I also would help in other departments as well, such as grocery stock or recovery and many others.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Lubbock, TX",11/29/14,2014,11,29
Not Worth It,"I worked with the company for nearly 10 years, and seen a lot. The stores managers lie, hide things, and are taught to abuse their authority. Associates are disposable to the company, and they could care less about your well being. Fire exits were constantly blocked, equipment was broken often and never got repaired, broken ladders you were told to just use them, the roofs leaked badly like a small river in the back rooms, black mold growing on walls, open ended wires hanging from the ceiling, dead rodents under the steel found in back rooms, company policies and standards constantly ignored or changed by managers, broken carts your forced to use, unloaders being told to work harder and faster by management resulting in one unloader dying of a heart attack, and another getting her toe smashed. You would constantly sweat because the backrooms had no A/C, and unloaders were forced to work in a truck that was over 100 degrees inside during the summer, and they froze during the winter due to the dress code policies. They have little clicks of people who band together and get their way, and with whom buy managers gifts, coffee, dinner, etc, to get ahead. Managers will target anyone who doesn't kiss their behind. So the whole theory of just going to work and getting your job done, won't work with them, as they will find ways to make your job miserable. Pay wasn't great either, as it took me nearly 10 years to even start making decent money, and that was after going on overnights. Apply at your own risk is all I can say.",1,Former Employee,Inventory Manager ,"Queensbury, NY",11/29/14,2014,11,29

Is there anything left undone from 3rd shift, gathering items that need to be returned to their specific modular home and basic organization. Then I would get my Gemini (a handheld device Wal-Mart utilizes for keeping up with inventory process and price changes) and scan the product that is low or has been sold out to ensure more is coming on the next truck or to ensure the inventory is accurate. After that process (or during) I get my instruction from upper management and add the things that I have found that need to be done (if workload and time permits). At that point I determine which associate is assigned to what job and what time. Then its execute. I follow up on progress, give instruction where needed and help execute the assignments when needed. Before leaving for the day I ensure that the next shift that comes to work has adequate assignments. I will communicate with one or more of them through notes or in person. _x000D__x000D_I have gained a great deal of knowledge with my time at Wal-Mart.  I have gained experience in communicating with a large and diverse number of people. I have gained knowledge of reading and understanding profit and loss reports.

Co-workers are fun once you get to know them and they can teach you a lot they know. Managers are awesome they are always there if you don't understand something or need help with something.

I didn't mind working there but I didn't see myself going anywhere,My schedule was always very random so I never knew when I was coming in or not. The supervisors were helpful and friendly and most of the customers were very nice to me. I learned how to use a cash register and how to bag items. I didn't talk to a lot of my co-workers as a lot of them were older than me. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting away from the cash register and reshelving items because it allowed me to stretch my legs.

A Rough Struggle,"When I was a cashier at Walmart in Rochester, MN it was a great experience. The only problem was when I moved to Winona, MN for school. My day at work as a Jewelry Associate started with complaining about how much freight was racked up in the back and that we needed to get it all done that day. Keep in mind I was usually the only morning associate. My co-workers were amazing but the supervisors and ZMS were the complete opposite. They set unrealistic expectations and did not seem to reason with the fact that customers came first. The hardest part of my job was definitely balancing the customers over the work load. the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to successfully help customers and make a positive impact on my co-worker's day. Walmart is a good company to work for with good benefits; even for part-time. I would recommend it to someone who would be able to handle the emotional impact that the company can produce such as managers getting on you about getting things done when your supervisors are telling you to do the exact opposite.",3,Current Employee,Optometry Assistant ,"Winona, MN",11/23/14,2014,11,23

Fast pace work enviroment,its basically being a stocker and watching the front for customers while you stock. It demands more attention than a regular stocking job.

This is on top of the fact that we are only allowed a 30 minute lunch in the pharmacy. I also found out that I am part time and am not allowed to get extra hours and am not allowed to get benefits for a year.I was not initially told that when hired. I was told I was receive benefits.I tried to move to full time and I was told I would have to wait on the waiting list AND  be at the new store longer for them to see how I perform.I take medication and I am uninsured and can not see a doctor for my health problems yet I work in a pharmacy of all places.Being on your feet all day makes me feel elderly and in pain and I am not even 30.

A regular day at work starts with unloading 2, sometimes 3, 72 foot Trailers filled with merchandise. The contents of the trailer when being handled individually, products weighed up to 70 lbs. After unloading we would use pallet jacks to pull freight to the floor. Afterwards, we would often pick items off of the back shelves and bring them to the floor. _x000D__x000D_As a Sales Associate, I worked in the Electronics department. I assisted customers in finding products that they needed, compared prices and brands with them, to help them make a better decision on their purchase._x000D__x000D_Hardest part of the job I would say is unloading the trailer, definitely hard work but not impossible._x000D__x000D_The most enjoyable part of my working there, was the friendships I created between myself and my coworkers, they often gave me more praise for hard work than the supervisors/managers.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate / Unloader ,"Oklahoma City, OK",11/22/14,2014,11,22

Wal-mart was one of the first jobs I had when I came of age to work so everything was a learning experience for me. It definitely taught me a lot about money management, customer satisfaction, job structure, and about being prompt. My managers there were pretty much the greatest people I had encountered. They were very sweet and always generous when it came to being helpful. Co-workers like the management were very nice and generous people. I still keep up with most of the co-workers and managers that I worked with too. The hardest part of the job is when a problem arises at the register and you need a mangers help but they are busy. Keeping the customer waiting is never good. Aside from the hard parts the easiest part of the job is always being nice to the customer because no amount of attitude is worth losing me job over.

"Productive, hard working environment","A typical day as an IMS (Inventory Management System) associate for me is coming to work, clocking in, and going to the back area of the store, where the loading docks are. All of the associates that are working there for the day unload the trucks of merchandise and before we are able to do our job, the IMS associates help set up the back area and give us as much space as we can use to setup properly. We unload the trucks by sorting out the merchandise on pallets for the departments that they belong too. This usually takes about a few hours to do, depending on how many associates are scheduled, how many trucks we receive, and how much merchandise are on the trucks. I work very well with my co-workers and we get the job done quickly, as well as joking around, laughing and having a fun time. One of the hardest parts about the job is sometimes when we receive a truck, the truck delivers merchandise already on pallets so all we have to do, is take them off the truck and put them somewhere in the back area until we are able to bring them out later to the sales floor. It is even more difficult when there is no more room in the backroom and management can direct us on where we can bring the pallets.",4,Current Employee,Inventory Management Associate ,"Naugatuck, CT",11/19/14,2014,11,19
Wal-Mart,"A typical day at work is fast pace, associates work with a sense of urgency to tend to all customers needs.

Meaning, we tore down displays, floors for new tiling, moved whole isles, placed new cash registers, changed wall signs, and etc to give Walmart its new look for 2015 and beyond. I learned stock codes, store terms & meanings, as well as grasping how each associate and position help run the store and keep things running smoothly. _x000D_     The hardest part of my job to some may be the public restrooms._x000D_The most enjoyable part of my job is having benefits, and great discount deals during the holiday season, as if getting paid wasn't enough.",5,Current Employee,Maintenance Associate [Overnight] ,"Memphis, TN",11/19/14,2014,11,19

"Fun , Produtive , Semi Organized ,","As for me although the organization wasn't as organized as I dreamed it would be I did learn a lot of transferable skills that I believe can be used in everyday life & to further my career.

Most part of the day I stocked merchandise , made sure the area was always upkeep , training new associate's from the team , etc. My management was pretty awesome for my first short term with this establishment . Giving every 5 to 6 months we had a new member of management starts to become routine but it also gave me a sense of disorganized , unstable ,& that's not were I am at this moment. The hardest part of being on an overnight team as an overnight associate is most defiantly the sleep I can honestly say my job was a breeze never to difficult at all.

Stressful with little pay...,A typical day at work is you walk in fine and by the time you leave you one big stress ball just waiting to explode. What I've learned working for this company is you have no friends everyone is for themselves just waiting for you to turn your back so they can stab it. Management for this company is closed minded with no common sense they are just there to get you to do the most work for every dollar no matter the circumstances or consequences. The bottom line is all that matters to them.  If you think you're going to move up in this company then you are wrong.  Unless your a brown noser that the only way.

Walmart workplace,"Although it is very quick paced and mainly customer based.

They don't work with your schedule, even if you have kids, depending on the store manager if you get a good quarterly bonus or not. Management is rude to associates.

Busy workplace,A typical work day is very busy. I've learned that you can't please everybody. Management needs to be more on the same page when it comes to the workers.

This is a very busy and fast paced work environment, a lot of the time. I learned how to multi-task and quickly, yet efficiently check out customers orders while being as friendly as possible. At the time of my employment, at Wal Mart, the managers very much picked their 'favorite' employees and that sometimes made for an awkward work environment. I did, however, get along very well with my co-workers. The hardest part of this job was standing long hours and trying to quickly take care of customers without appearing to be rude.

Great job to learn people skills and work as a team.,"My work days are rarely the same, which I  do not mind because it never gets boring. I have been trained in many areas of the store over the span of four years, so which ever department is in most need of my help is where I will be. If I am in jewelry, which is my current job title, a normal day consists of counting, binning, stocking, price changes, special orders, ring sizing's, replacing watch batteries and bands, layaway, etc. During the day if the the service desk, money center, registers, or fitting room become busy I step in to help, as expected. I also have been known to work third shift to reset modulars as needed, and we recently just finished with a remodel in which I was also a part of. One thing I have picked up since working with Walmart that I was not the best at before is multitasking. The Management team is really great at instilling initiative and teaching you to put customers first. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is the appreciation of a customer after you have helped them, while the hardest part of the job for me is having to be away from family on holidays. This is the main reason as to why I am searching for alternative long- term employment.",4,Current Employee,Jewelry ,"Bluefield, VA",11/17/14,2014,11,17

As a Department Manager over Sporting Goods I was working 40 hours per week and earning $8.95 per hour.  My life was very chaotic outside of work as it was a constant struggle to pay the bills.  I went days without eating just to keep the lights on.

Very nice environment in the store,"A day at the Walmart store was good. I learned how to run cash register and how to organize clothing by size, color and style. The mangers works well with employers when time was needed off. Some of the co workers were not friendly at all but we worked good together. The hardest part of this job was Walmart slogan,  ""the customers is always right even if they were wrong"". I enjoyed meeting people and learning different things about items customers purchased that I wasn't familiar with._x000D__x000D_The Distribution Center was a totally different. It was noisy and some of the forklift driver didn't follow safety guidelines. This job taught me how to count inventory and input data. Like the store, the managers were good people and the co workers were not friendly. There is nothing hard about this job, but after you counted you work, you had to make sure the forklift driver didn't come along and move it to another area where you or someone else had to count. This could very well cause miscalculation. I enjoy the hour and days I worked.

Hectic Place to Work,"In my time at Walmart my time there has been not what I expected. The typical day is extremely hectic and has many obstacles to overcome. The problem is organization and execution of he job. Management tends to change direction to much leaving not only the supervisors but the rest of the crew in situations that are not necessary and make it more difficult to do the job. The co workers are not that bad, but the hardest part of the day is when after all you do there is still a mad dash in a sense to get the basics of your job done. Management tends to be unorganized and not on the same page when it comes to getting the job done. They give to many directions without a realistic outlook on what the people are capable of doing.",1,Current Employee,Inventory Supervisor ,"Decatur, GA",11/16/14,2014,11,16

I learned that it was a little difficult to juggle a job, school and being a new single parent and that working in a place that deals with people is much more fun than i thought it would be. My department manager was a very good and caring person. He never gave us more than we could handle. He helped out with what he could when he was finished with his own assigned task. The hardest part of the job was putting stock into the freezer. Frozen food is heavy and not to easy to handle. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers.

Nothing of real excitement happens here,"A typical day at work would start with the myself and fellow department managers attempting to follow day to day routines and halfway through completion, being called for a meeting to be told to start new projects. Followed by management constantly coming by to check up on progress only to add more work load to an already stressful and unrealistic task. If at the end of the day we get all tasks and projects completed, we get very little appreciation or gratitude. Most of the department managers and I get along fine with one another but there are groups that we feel get special treatment by certain assistant managers which allows them unfair advantages. The hardest part of the day is the stress that the work load leaves my physical and mental state in. My managers have no problem changing tasks, schedules, and hours at a moments notice, which makes it very difficult to plan any sort of outside schedule. I would honestly say the best part of every day is when I get to leave work and come home to my family.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Lacey, WA",11/15/14,2014,11,15

Most long term co-workers were great people who were a pleasure to work with. Management was great until the company changed the set up of the management team.

The co-workers were the best people to work with, very nice, and very helpful if you needed.

Walmarts Alright,A typical day is taking the role of an associate and doing what your manager or their manager or their manager want. I have learned Walmart is about who you know not really how you work. Co workers are OK dependent upon whether or not they can actually do as they say in their interviews.

I enjoyed being able to learn a variety of positions and working with different people. Management was a pleasure to deal with an often went out of their way to make your work experience better. (A manager actually drove to my house to bring me to work in a snow storm.) The workers of Walmart are easy going folk that often enjoy working with people albeit are not often very driven. Occasionally, customers would incite a small riot at your register and often times you had no real power to help them without management which often led to unnecessary stress.

It was fun when around peers,"Typical work day was get straight to work and focus on the customers.  First thing you learn with working in a major retail store is patience especially with management because they were very disorganized and the customer is not their first priority because when they're called for assistance, sometime it would take 30 minutes or more to respond.  Some won't even come.  They'll send someone else while they sit on the phone on a person call, or if they just didn't want to help.  The co-workers were the exact opposite of management, and the hardest thing with working for walmart was the poor communication from management and doing double work because of that.  I enjoyed the customers the most.  They were the reason I showed up for work everyday.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Memphis, TN",11/9/14,2014,11,9

Walmart is the worst place to be employed.,"Walmart thinks just because they are some huge corporation that they can treat their employee's like complete garbage. That is exactly what they do. They say that the customer is always right, but when customer's would try to come in and return things, manager's would make up excuses as to why they couldn't take it back even if the item was in perfect condition or even unopened.

"Walmart was a great place to work, My preferences changed over time having a family","I worked at Walmart for a little over 3 years. starting as a stocker and had held different positions over time. I worked as a cashier, lawn and garden and customer service. I worked an 35-40 hours per week. I learned that with Walmart I had job security. I enjoy working around people and get along with most everyone. I really didn't feel that there was a hard part in any position I held, as I knew what my job responsibilities would be each time I worked a different area. I enjoy working; I enjoy working around people and helping customers. Management was good, they were very understanding while I was going to school full time and working full time. They were understanding when I could no longer do both. The only thing I didn't like was that I worked every weekend. I didn't get very much family time with working  different hours.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/ Customer Service ,Council Bluffs,11/9/14,2014,11,9

It's a nice place for beginning a job,"A typical day at work ranges from a piece of cake to almost overwhelming. I learned a lot about being in a team and making a team effort. I can't really put my finger down on management because they change it so much. But the first two years I worked there, the management was top-notch. Many of my coworkers came and went, but the ones who stayed were the best kind of courtesy associates that I've known. The hardest part of the job would be the weather and/or the possibility of ineffective equipment, thus making the job more difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job are some of the experiences that take place, with both associates and customers.

About what you'd expect from a job at Walmart (not so good).,"I don't want to sound too negative, but in over 10 years of working at Walmart, I've learned that the typical ""horror"" story tends to be true. Walmart prides itself in saying things like ""Our average worker makes over $12 an hour,"" but that is only true if we're averaging salaried management as well. If you take them out of the equation, pay drops drastically. My job is relatively complicated to do: lots of responsibilities. The most enjoyable part is having a position that pays more than 90% of the positions within Walmart not including management. Management is at best mediocre and at worst straight up incompetent - with a few exceptions. My advice is to steer away from working for that company if you  can.",3,Current Employee,CLAIMS ASSOCIATE ,"El Paso, TX",11/8/14,2014,11,8

Long Term Stability.,"When I started working for Wal-Mart back in 2005 I had high hopes of making this my career, with plans in advancement. Now nine years later, I question why I stayed so long instead of bettering myself. I have a lot of passion for any job I do, I have no issue giving it 110 percent of who I am, but after giving for so long and not getting even close to where I want to be, I'm unhappy. Wal-Mart is a good company for someone just starting out, but I wouldn't recommend to make it a lifetime career. _x000D__x000D_Bottom line. I have a lot of knowledge from the many years that Ive worked there. I know enough to be in management. I love the people I work with, and regardless of being unhappy or not I do love the company. I love that they have given me nine years of stability, but I hate how management works. _x000D__x000D_Nothing is perfect anywhere.

WalMart,"Despite the various rumors that the corporate superstore is evil incarnate, I was not thinking about the company itself as I worked my shifts.  The people I worked with, for, or around were all pretty good people from what I got to know of them, and the environment was pretty friendly._x000D__x000D_Depending on your job, its either something you hate, or something you grow to tolerate, and mine were the ones I grew to tolerate.  _x000D__x000D_I only ever really had one problem with another employee, but it was far from personal.  The man was, at the time, in charge of both Maintenance and Produce over in the Grocery department, and often times, while learning how to operate one of the machines as a Maintenance Associate, I would see him and he would eventually come up to me and proceed to inform me of what I was doing wrong, and proceed to tell me the right way.  The problem with this was the fact that the guy was an absolute perfectionist, and it always felt like he had 5 ""mistakes"" he could have called me out on, despite the fact that while my work wasn't perfect, it was hardly bad enough to continually be called out for.  It was only after the management got him to well and truly stick with his position running the Produce department that things truly felt more comfortable and the store did not suffer from it.",4,Former Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Princeton, IN",11/8/14,2014,11,8

Only if you really need a job.,"Working for Walmart isn't as bad as people make it however, prepared for poor work ethics among coworkers, unhelpful managers, and disrespectful customers. Often, I worked hard there but only to secure my job, not to move up. In order to move up the average time to get into a higher position, depends on if the position is available, if you're qualified, and must get approved by management to make sure that someone else can fill your old position. In other words, unless you're willing to work for the company for 10+ years, go to college and get a management degree in 2 years and find a better job.",3,Former Employee,Unloader ,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",11/8/14,2014,11,8

The co-workers are very easy to get along with and they are very nice not only to the customers but to other associate's as well.

"Difficult Place To Work, Delporable Work Conditions","Never have I worked for a Company that is anti-employee. Hours are being stripped from people already struggling to get by.

Although it is a fast paced work environment and I have met many wonderful people both customers and fellow employees alike.... I do not make enough in the 4 years I have worked here to sustain myself and my family. I do not receive the support I need from my supervisors, in order to properly serve my customers, as at times when I needed assistance in order to help my customers, I was told flat out NO or ignored entirely.

Fun place to work and learn!,"A typical day at work would consist of many shoppers but not enough associates. I learned to work at a quick and friendly pace so that every customer is satisfied. The management team could be a little more interactive with the customers as well as the associates. Looking up from time to time to just say thank you for what you have done would change many lives. My co-workers have learned to just take care of one customer at a time. We learn from each other and teach each other when we are lacking a professional management team. The hardest part would be contacting management when there is an emergency. For example, I witnessed a customer slip and fall the protocol is to contact a salaried member of management, they should respond as quickly as possible. It take at least two minutes to get from the back of the store up to front on a regular day. When this incident occurred it took management at least ten minutes to come from the back of the store to the front. They acted as if the person was did not need medical attention at all. For any accidents only management can call for emergency personnel to arrive on the seen. But lucky there was someone with the person that fell to go ahead and call 911 because our management team was not very concerned. That incident broke my heart to see how they would treat others in case of emergency, so I knew if it wasn't an emergency but serious they would not be in a hurry at all. But on the other hand, I love meeting the new people and seeing there smiles and sometimes becoming a part of their lives.

It could have just been the store i worked at because i have been to other store and seem the typical ""Horrible walmart customer service"" but at my store we actually tried to provide good service to an extent. higher management was lousy at times leaving us to deal with issues when they didnt want to handle it, and handing out coaching and terminations to people they had vendettas against. but as long as you actaully worked and did your job it was noticed, stay away from the cliches and brown nosing that everyone loves to do and your good. Customers were the worst though when they wouldnt be able to understand the rules of certain policies and then taking in out on the workers when its not their fault.

Counting money in a small box,"My job started at 5 AM. I would start by collecting all of the money out of the SAM coke machines. I would go back to the cash office and start the daily count of all the money, the safe, and the money bags for front registers. When that was over I would move on to the paperwork portion. I would go through and highlight any suspicious activity from previous days' returns. We would allow customers to return items with no receipt and put them on a store card by using their DL. I would flag anything over $50. We caught many thieves this way. I learned money management while working here. I also learned new tricks to find people trying to steal. I had a great management team here. The co-workers were all great and supportive. Many people will argue that walmart is the devil, but when you have a great team, it will wash everything bad away. The hardest part of the job was finding out that sometimes when the registers were short, it was because employees were stealing. The most enjoyable part of the job was re-organizing and filing paperwork. I take pride in the fact that I am neat, organized and a clean freak.

The hardest part was going every day with back and forth talking and less working. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out.,3,Former Employee,Inventory control management ,"Kokomo, IN",11/2/14,2014,11,2

Everyday i learn something new from the store, from the help of coworkers. My coworkers are very well mannered and make sure the job gets done. The hardest part of the job is management always has something else for us to do even when our list of duties arent done. Which effects our work by leaving some things for the next day because we have to do what management wants us to do first.

I would take cash, credit cards, checks, EBT or WIC as form of payment - so making sure I was up to date on various forms of payment was crucial to job performance and Walmart made sure that I knew how to do my job.  As with any job, the hardest part would be dealing with grouchy or grumpy customers - But you have to muddle your way through them with a Smile on your face because you never know what their circumstances are....All in all - Walmart is a very enjoyable place to work and you can move up and make a career there if your so inclined to but you have to be willing to do the work required of you!",4,Former Employee,CASHIER ,"Columbus, GA",10/29/14,2014,10,29

Solid work that was able to test my skills in multitasking and physical limits.,"A typical day at work as a truck unloader/stocker has more ups than downs. Despite it being physically demanding, it also tested your sorting and multitasking skills required by my managers. I was able to learn about my physical limits on the job and how to also deal with certain situations involving difficult customers and demanding time schedules when it came to unloading certain sized truck loads. Management would be very strict and on occasion very overwhelming on specific times in order to unload our truck deliveries. An example of this is when they expect the unloaders to unload a 3200 piece truck in the same time as an 1800 piece truck. Management at night tended to be more lenient and much more understanding when it came to different sized quotas and other tasks asked of their employees. My coworkers came with several unique backgrounds, one being an employee for over 15 years and others being in my age group. Most were very hard working while others tended to be lazy simply because they believed the newer employees should do more work than them. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job was definitely the physical part of it. Stretches before unloading a truck was a daily must, whether you are on the truck putting the items on the line to send to the other unloaders to sort and vice versa, if you are bringing the items out on pallets to the sales floor for the overnight stockers. Even if you are sick with a cold or still exhausted from the nights before, you are expected to carry out your duties as an unloader with the same amount of effort as the previous days and within an - more...",4,Former Employee,Truck Unloader/Stocker ,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",10/29/14,2014,10,29

I understand that there are some employees that need babysitting but NOT all of us.

First thing in the morning we were also responsible  for helping the opening parmacist bag prescriptions that were ready for pick-up. We also made sure money was in the registers, depending on what time the cashier came in, and checking and logging refrigerator and freezer temps. The closing tech was responsible for making sure log copies were in the proper numbered order and put away, making sure supplies were ordered, making sure supplies were stocked, and making sure things were in order for the next day. Closing techs were also responsible for checking and logging refrigerator and freezer temps. I learned the functionality of the job. What was required of me by the pharmacists as well as the other techs. I learned how to bill insurance companies while being in compliance with the state laws and regulations.

A fast paced environment with focused employees,"A typical day for me involves interacting with costumers. Making sure all my area is clean and stocked. Working with management to make sure any issues are addressed and fixed. The employees there are dedicated to their jobs, with most being there for 5 or more years, but on the down side, the store feels understaffed with many of the employees having to handle two or more department all at the same time, and some employees not being able to do parts of their job at all because they do not  have the training to work the equipment needed or are not physical able to because of age..  Management feel disconnected, this could be because that most of our head management is new to the store and haven't connected with their employees.Most assistant management is willing to help in anyway possible but because of the staffing issue, it becomes a strain on them finishing their job. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing things being accomplished.

"Uptight, Rude, Not Understanding",I didn't like this job at all and it was very hard to work here. During the time I worked there I would go in for 8 hour shifts and stand on my feet the whole time behind a cash register and when I didnt have a customer I would be standing at the end of my register asking people to check out. I learned how to work a register better and how to do returns. I learned that all customers are not the same and I just have to stay calm and do my job. I didn't really like my managers and they were very rude and just didn't care whether you were sick or not feeling well. The co workers were the best though. I loved being around them and talking to them. They were all friendly and outgoing.

They aren't too bad concerning pay considering other places only offer minimum wage and no incentives but still don't offer decent wages. If you want a promotion you have to make a pain of yourself over years of working for them to recognize you and even then they only promote you one grade at a time even if you are overqualified. Even with a college degree they would not let me be an assistant manager, but instead gave me an overnight position as hourly supervisor. Talk about hitting below the belt",2,Current Employee,Support manager ,Pennsylvania,10/23/14,2014,10,23

"Flexible Schedule, Job Security, and Friendly Work Environment","I worked at Walmart for approximately two and a half years, and over that time period I began to love my job. The day I started work I was immediately welcomed with open arms. Everyone around me was friendly, passionate about their work, and quick to help out the newcomer. After a few months I knew every one of my co-employees, and in the mean time they had also taught me everything that I needed to know about my job, and job duties. I quickly earned the Employee of the Month Award, and was noticed by all my superiors as a hard working employee. Soon enough; after about a year, they promoted me to a supervisor position. Finally all my hard work had paid off for the best. Walmart was where I honed in on my people skills, learning how to build a good re-pore, and honest teamwork.

I no problems with my co-workers at all they all love the way I did my job. There wasn't anything hard about job unless you didn't collect all the carts out of the parking lot and you decided to walk around the and goof out most the day but with me have a father like mine where he trained me to be a hard worker at what ever it took to complete the job, I remember what I was taught by my father and did what I knew had to done to complete my task as a cart pusher at Walmart.",4,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Defiance, OH",10/23/14,2014,10,23

I have learned many things working with Wal-Mart from cashiering duties to performing hazmats and continue to learn new things when required to. Management is strictly professional on the sales floor and within increasing business performance, however, behind the back room and fulfilling employees requests is lacking. Co-workers are friendly, most gossip, but get along face-to-face. The hardest part is managing personal time with work. It is difficult to balance it out with the schedule they tend to give you unless you are an open shift. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers. Fellow cashiers tend to be there for you and are supportive of issues that might rise. Most care for one another.

During my time with the company I learned financials, budgeting, people skills, and enhanced customer communication. A typical day includes preparing deposits, holding meetings, covering reviews, covering job performance coaching's, scheduling, interviewing, hiring, and training.  The hardest part of the job was to ensure proper training of associates, many times new tasks were created and took priority over training, so delegations and follow up became very important.  The people I worked with were the most enjoyable part of the job.  It was very much like an extended family.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Geneva, NY",10/22/14,2014,10,22

"Good place to work, but the worst management ever","To me, working at Walmart is a pretty good, I really enjoyed that it gets busy on and off throughout the day. I didn't learn much at Walmart since they pretty much didn't train me at all except for the job I did which was pushing carts. The management is the worst part about Walmart, they would lie about everything and go after the ones that work hard while letting those who don't do anything get away with everything. Another con about the management is that they would always target someone that they did not like, and when I worked there, I was that target and was constantly jumped by the management, making me extremely nervous and scared. There was no hard part about the job except that you have to keep working or you'll get behind, the job itself was very easy and very enjoyable. The most enjoyable part about working there is the co workers who make working there enjoyable. I would recommend working here if you really need a job, but won't recommend it because of the management",3,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Lakewood, CO",10/21/14,2014,10,21
i like working there,i worked over 4 years.  i worked in the frozen and dairy dept.  i always work above what was asked to do.  the changing of management is reason i'm not there now.  felt if what every i did  they did like.  i ask more then one time after the change how can i do what  need me to do better and the way you want.  got to point where one would tell me to do this  and the other would tell do it different.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Auburndale, FL",10/21/14,2014,10,21

meh.,"the thing with Walmart is that while its a great company to work for, and i would go back if i wasn't a soon to be dad with bills to pay for, there are some things about this company that is inconsistent with what they tell you in orientation. while it is sometimes true that your success depends on your work ethic, its also true that who you  ""buddy buddy"" up to depends on how far you go in this company. while some store honor their elderly employees, some stores work on getting their elderly employees out and replace them with  younger people with worse work ethics and inferior attitudes. as far as the pay goes its depending on your job. but, at least in Illinois, with the cost of living ; you'd have to live with your parents or a room mate.",4,Former Employee,frozen/dairy ,"Galesburg, IL",10/21/14,2014,10,21

So-So experience,"We usually have a meeting at the beginning of the shift about where we are assigned to go work for the night and where to go if we finish early.  I learned how to read locations of items and how to make cardboard and paper bales.  Management is ususally one of two assistant managers along with a support manager for the night.  They assign us where to go and check on us periodically as the night-shift proceeds.  Some of my co-workers aren't exactly team players when it comes to helping each other out.  Some of them would rather walk around or purposely move slow instead of helping other co-workers in need.  That's what makes the hardest part of working here, along with a enormous amount of freight to work.

"Great pay, but expects a lot.",I have worked at the Wal-Mart Distribution Center for about 3 and a half years. The hours were long but I did not mind. The pay was great but they expected an extremely high production which most people had trouble meeting. We got a cost of living rate every year but the production also went higher. Job security and benefits were pretty good but I did not like they would sometimes make us mandatorily come in on our weekend with only giving us a few hours notice before our weekend was about to begin.,3,Former Employee,DA Order Filler/FID Processor/X-Dock Door Runner ,"Grove City, OH",10/20/14,2014,10,20

Walmart,"A typical day at work consisted of being pulled to whatever department they needed me in. We were severely understaffed and our management team did little to nothing to help; they simply moved people around to different areas of the store in which they had never been trained. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the stress of my employer not being flexible with my college schedule. I was, and am still currently, a full time college student.

Productive and fast working environment,"Depending on the day I would go into work and meet up with my manager to receive my tasks for the day. Work tasks vary from working freight, creating picks for the sales floor, retrieving picks from the back room, creating features or replacing old features, and ultimately providing excellent customer service. No matter what job customers always come first even if you have a hundred tasks you must complete in a day. If a customer needs help you stop everything and service them. Management is on top of all daily tasks and there for each team member as needed. Co-workers work as a team and if needed assist you to complete tasks at hand. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing how much you can do in a day and making a difference in the customer's life by helping them by: finding an item,  reaching a high item, going to the back and getting something we may be out of on the floor.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Russellville, AR",10/20/14,2014,10,20

Management was on you, they make sure that the people in the fresh departments are always doing what they need to do, and that the sales floor is always stocked with presentable produce.

I personally have always worked with people and I have learned to be patient and to have open ears and eyes for everyone. I am an open minded person easy to get along with.

I learned processes exclusive to Walmart and the were readily able to teach.  When I started, the management team was very open, helpful, and responsive, now they too have so much on their plate- within the last 3 years- they've become robots.  In fact, in the Omaha area,  a new market manager was put into place, and ALL the stores have lost 70% of their management team.  Genuine people who have been with the company for 7 to 15 years- either quit or were fired, due to the company taking a new direction, that is less than employee friendly.

Busy but fun working atmosphere with nice people.,"I enjoyed the customers and coworkers but I enjoyed mostly being able to do Modular changes which was changing the products on the shelf to match the new floor plan.  Hardest part of the job was when we were short staffed and weren't able to leave the department to help another customer or not having any supervisors around to help with customer complaints or when something needed changed. Management was usually very helpful when we had questions or needed something to do and to help cover our department for any reason. What I learned from working in retail and at Walmart is how to prioritize my daily duties and patience with customers and management. I also learned how to do certain projects faster and how to maintain a whole department by myself.

Fast paced work enviroment but once time is managed not bad,"Energy both positive and negative moves quickly through the store so if your someone who can handle the waves of emotions without it effecting you this is a good place to go. the job is fast paced but if you set a reasonable pace(meaning not too fast or too slow) for yourself to start with when your hired if something happens to cause you to slow down later on it won’t be as noticeable as if you start working at your fastest pace. Co-workers become like family but don’t be caught talking too much because work always needs to be done. The hardest part of the job to me is being thrown more instructions then are humanly possible to complete in a short shift and having to prioritize them based on what is the most important or which manager has the highest ranking without making any  managers think you are deliberately going against them but once you have the timing down on most aspects of your position it gets better and the prioritizing comes easier. To me the most enjoyable part of the job is helping put smiles on the customer’s faces when you know they aren’t having the best of days but there are plenty of back room jobs available if you are one that doesn’t like angry customer interactions. As to management your experience can go one of two ways. either they love you because of how fast paced you can work and how willing you are to do what they ask or they will dislike you because you have to tell them no on something. There really isn’t much in-between but it can work to your advantage. getting on managements good side by doing what is asked to the best of your ability, it - more...",3,Current Employee,Jewelry sales associate ,"Painted Post, NY",10/16/14,2014,10,16

It happened to be a 2005 Ford F-150 who met the passenger side of the car. It hit me, I was flown via Care-Flight to Parkland hospital to wake up 30 days later with 15 screws in the right side of my pelvis, and I had a tear in my intestine which caused me to be readmitted for a week stay.

productive work and duties,My shift was full-time and I learned a lot about janitorial work and i got to work on my own and keeping the routine going.I remembered that I used to clean the break room and cleaning up the counters and sweeping it and mopping it and making sure the microwave oven was clean and it was an everyday thing.

Friendship Grows In This Place,"I wasn't very satisfied with the cleanliness of this place, being that it was a restaurant, it should have been cleaned accurately enough to keep pest out, the food to be used before expiration dates, the people working to the restaurant to have cleanliness such as hygiene. There was also problems with the way the management handled absence's and tardiness, they were very lenient with their employee and they should be enforcing there policies. I do have to say a plus was a curtain manager he was very fast, respectful, clean when he was working, and enforced all of the rules I was very satisfied with that member of management but he was not the store manager.",1,Former Employee,Team Member ,"Phoenix, AZ",10/14/14,2014,10,14
A career that will build your skills for leadership.,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consists of many challenges.  I am the type of person that enjoys challenges.  At 8:30am, Management will meet to discuss any projects for the day.  These projects come in the form of notations from our daily sales floor tour.  We will plan out our day by evaluating our resources utilizing a staffing report(TMAT).  Then, we look at our deliveries scheduled later in the day and plan for their unloading using the TMAT and Task Management Tool.  When we are completed with our planning we will discuss any issues that may have come up. i.e. people issues, customer complaints, delivery issues, etc. _x000D_The challenges that I am faced with are usually staffing vs. workload challenges.  These are challenges because regardless of what the associate roster may look like the workload must be completed by deadline. I measure my success of the day by the amount of work my team and I are able to complete by the deadline, which is 4:00pm.  In the midst of my workload I am also responsible for completing administrative tasks.  Which include, associate attendance tracking, evaluations, write ups, seasonal planning, project planning, display planning, etc. This requires time management, multi-tasking, delegation/follow-up, and utilization of my Zone Merchandise Supervisors and Department Managers for leadership. Throughout my day I am also responsible for handling any customer complaints, associate issues, Vendors and Merchandisers, Ecolab visits, Dept. of Ag visits, and assisting with Loss Prevention apprehensions.  _x000D_Over the years, I have learned a great deal of patience - more...",5,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Orlando, FL",10/14/14,2014,10,14

Others just seemed to be there for a check and could care less about their employees and their feelings. I really wouldn't recommend anyone to work at a WalMart store just off of my experience alone, but I can't say that is true about every WalMart store in the world.

It's not fair to the associates that do stand by the policies, isn't backed up by their superior.

Great group of co workers,"On a typical day, my department (electronics) is severely understaffed. Due to the lack of employees, we (my coworkers and I) are required to basically run the entire back of the store (departments including but not limited to: stationary, photo lab, hardware/paint counter, sporting goods/ammo case). It is very stressful and very frustrating. My coworker(s) and I make the best of any situation and often times find ourselves leaning on one another for support. The management as a whole could be better. They are often unappreciative, disrespectful, and condescending. Individually, each manager is an almost completely different person and seem to be much more understanding and easy to talk to. I'd say the ""hardest"" part of the job is when you are asked to do a different thing, by a different manager, every 5 minutes. You then have to decide which task is ""more important"" or which manager you're less likely to get in trouble with if you don't complete the assignment. The problem with management is their failure to communicate with each other.",3,Current Employee,"ELECTRONICS SALES ASSOCIATE, DELI ASSOCIATE ","Stow, OH",10/7/14,2014,10,7

Multitasking can be up to 4 things being done at once, not simultaneously but at the most! Wal mart wants us to do more. Sometimes I have to stop myself so I can use the bathroom. I do not enjoy the job anymore. People are complaining about the wait time. Pharmacists are really being held responsible for too much. Health & Wellness will fall flat on its face within the year with all these new changes. Technicians are underpaid and so are the cashiers. When someone calls out sick, then we have to do their job as well. I am not saying the work is bad, but too much work in this type of field can literally kill someone!

It wasn't a perfect place to work in but I did learn quite a lot from this company. I learned how to come out of my shell and be more social with customers and co-workers. I learned how to handle stressful situations such as long lines and what seems like a million different customers coming to you for answers because you're the only one in charge.I met a lot of new and cool people in some of my co-workers and no matter if they left, it always seem like new hires would always be as friendly as the ones before them. Most of them were co-workers you could depend on and have a fun time with while still doing your job. The hardest part would most likely be the under appreciation from some of management.

It's okay for a short-term first job.,"The work is super easy, honestly I enjoyed working there. However the Walmart location I worked at had horrible management. It seemed that the dumbest workers were promoted or the laziest and least deserving were given the most hours. They would keep me in one area for months at a time until I really only knew that area while other areas had changed, and then flip flop me around to places that I wasn't even remotely familiar with and expect to have the job done in a ridiculous amount of time, or less. If you're looking at just the work itself, awesome job. Easy, kind of fun to be honest (if you like stocking shelves and making them look nice), and nighttime hours are my favorite. Co-workers weren't too bad, but 3rd shift will always have some really odd characters, working there and customer wise as well. The hardest part of the job, for myself, was dealing with BS managers.

Idle Workplace with low Positive Energy,"A normal day at work for me felt like I was on an assembly line most of the time, which is good in certain aspects but not all. I liked knowing if there were particular and important tasks that needed done within the course of a day and my bosses were usually good about letting me know such things. I always enjoyed getting compliment from patrons both on my positive attitude given my personal circumstances. My co-works, a few in particular, were REALLY fun to be around since we were constantly talking and laughing.    _x000D_ However, one of the more negative parts of the job, for me personally, was be told to continually work in the same area (front door) over the course of several consecutive days. That spells oaring because I was only able to greet customers for anywhere from a six to eight hour shift. I would have liked to straighten up display, do returns or perhaps be trained to work within a different area of the store, even if that met I wouldn’t work in new areas all the time. Only within my last year and a half or so was I allowed to do more than just be a greeter. And this was after I had repeatedly asked and fallowed company policy. Unfortunately, during my yearly evaluations, even though I had a solid record and management would ask if I wanted to change positions within the company and I answered “yes” to more job training, the requested training never came to pass. _x000D_When it came to working with management, I have mixed feelings since those who worked up front with the main body of employees (customer service managers) were exposed to day to day operations and what - more...",2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart People Greeter ,Grand Junction CO,10/3/14,2014,10,3

Poor Managment and unrealiable co-workers,"I work 8 hours a day, getting at least 36 hours weekly from  am-  pm. My job description is to stock, zone, and work with our customer for a sufficient shop at Wal-Mart. My job consist of doing a lot more than that, I work Toy, Groceries, Photo Lab and Connection Center, also just started working Layaway. I've learned that our management team is rude, improper, and they retaliate against their workers. For example, a Department Manager in the Deli got my order wrong and blamed it on another associate when my order was through her. The Department Manager gave a full time associate less than 23 hours for the following 2 weeks after the situation. My co-workers in the same department will not work and I'll report it to management but they turn the other way, leaving me in the Electronic Department by myself. It's hard for me to work there when I'm the only one handling customer service.

Very busy and hardworking store with a lot of great people.,"We bin a lot of merchandise, we bin everything that you would normally see out on the floor, the most of the stuff we bin is pharmacy, health and beauty, grocery and pets. we have a lot of grocery that comes to the backroom as overstock that all of the Inventory Associates have to bin. That is an every night thing for the overnight shift. It gets to be a lot of lifting, climbing ladders, and a whole bunch more, but what makes it a lot easier are your co-workers. I have learned to be more open to meeting people (I used to be really shy) and how to handle stressful frustrating situations. The managers are really fantastic, they take the time to talk to you and ask you how you are doing and if you need any help, much better than any other managers I've seen in other places. My co-workers are great, there are some that you don't get along with very well, but that happens at a lot of places anyone would work at. They are very helpful when you need help, they make sure you are doing things right when you let them know you are confused, they take the time to show you how to do things if you haven't done those certain things before. The hardest part of the job is carrying the juice up a ladder to put it in the top bins. The other part of the job that isn't the hardest but also not the easiest is finding spaces in the bins for certain items when the bins are almost full and you can barely find space and you have two whole carts to bin in.

"Great successful business, just poor management.","My review of Walmart would be not so good. This is only because the management in the store is so bad, no one communicates and they act like they dont want to be bothered by their associates.The hours are cut whenever it is convient and you are not garanteed a steady schedule. It is also very hard to talk about situations you have with managers to their managers without retaliation. Other than the negative Walmart is a great business just certain rotten eggs in the business make it a not so nice place to work.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Saint Petersburg, FL",10/1/14,2014,10,1
excellent management team,"I have enjoyed working with Walmart for the last four years. I type prescriptions, speak with doctors and nurses on a daily bases, fill prescriptions. I have learned all of the drug names, classes, and what they do. I love the management team, they are understanding and sweet. My co workers are wonderful as well, I enjoy working with them.

Very Productive,"Being a cashier was actually fun and easy. The more customer you have the faster your day goes by. Making conversation with your customers will also pass time especially if they have three baskets. Customers like their groceries bagged a certain way and I know this because I do too. Cold foods with cold foods, cans with cans, boxes with boxes, etc. Do not smash the bread or eggs so I bagges those together. The co-workers were nice and always helped it they had no one in line. The hardest part about being a cashier was just putting things back when cuastomers didn't want them. We had at least ten basket left every night. I enjoyed checking out customers because you meet all types of people.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Mebane, NC",10/1/14,2014,10,1

All depends on who your working with,Walmart is a huge company that has much to be desired with communication. Basic new information is supplied on a sort of homepage at the store but if you actually try to search the database for information pertaining to a specific topic you will likely be sorely disappointed. Also promotions after a certain point are a mystery to me. There are higher managers that know less about everything than I do. If you get stuck with one of them your work life is miserable. If you get one that knows the ropes then its a pretty decent experience.,4,Current Employee,Zone Supervisor ,"Kennett Square, PA",10/1/14,2014,10,1

Once I have handled all pressing issues I go over any training exercises that need tending to and update any personnel files that need my attention. If there are no new hires with I-9's needing verification or orientations I can get started on budgeting the next weeks scheduled hours or tend to any minor issues management might need to to handle. At the end of my day I have 2 more waves of employees needing my help with a multitude of different things that range from benefit information to time clock trouble shooting.

May it be new or familiar faces, a more complex tempo at which I am to work, or learning how to do new things that could help me further my Wal-Mart career. Constant time-management is necessary and expected. And I find it exciting that I never know what to expect. My managers are very friendly and will even jump in to help if things get into a bind, and my coworkers are always willing to do what it takes for our company to succeed. I enjoy the customers immensely, because one person can make your day. If nothing else, you can make theirs' with simply a smile and a nice attitude.

Steer Clear of this Establishment Unless its a Last Resort,"I've been working for Wal-Mart for 10+ years, since before I graduated. I've seen and heard a lot of things in those years, good and bad. But more bad then good. I'll say this first - if you have a chance to work anywhere else nowadays - take it. This place has gone too far south for its employees to stand. There is no morale to lower any farther. Incentives have been cut down to merely putting your name on a junk plaque and placing your picture on an all-star board in the back with nothing extra on your check. Word also was that if you come onto 3rds, there is no dollar on the hour extra. Anymore, its comes down to getting special colored shirt days or days when they give out food trays in the lounge to all shifts.(3rd shift rarely got anything fresh) The communication is something to be seen between the managers and associates of the various shifts. Sloppy at best. There is ALWAYS contradicting orders and/or stories being given. Many of the rules are and can be changed depending on the mere mood of certain people. Nothing is set in stone. Here - you are a name and number anymore - nothing else. And this can be verified by ALOT of us.

My experience as a Walmart Super Center employee,"I believe that some members of management at Walmart Super Center did not care about their duties at Walmart like they should have. The hand scanners did not work when I started working there as a front end cashier, none of them. The cashiers that were there before me were afraid to address the issue but I wasn't. The hand scanners were finally repaired or replaced. This helped the cashiers to avoid hurting their backs by lifting something that was too heavy and also helped us to scan faster. Whenever, I shop at Walmart now, I am often thanked by some of the cashiers that I worked with, for the new and, or repaired hand scanners. There are some members of management that look at me like I did something wrong at that time. I believe that I helped the company and I helped my fellow workers and that makes me feel good. I believe that those in authority at that time did not care that backs could have been sprained, or something worse could have happened. I'm thankful for the time that I was employed at the Super Center. I believe that I did make a difference there and if they would rehire me I would go back. I keep applying but I believe that management considers me too outspoken and won't call me. Oh well, if they don't, it's their loss.",3,Former Employee,Front End Cashier ,"Opelousas, LA",9/24/14,2014,9,24

Fair and consistent job enviroment,As you only hear the negative in the news of Walmart. It's only fair to the upside too. Walmart may not be a high paying job. But offers fair wages for the work they provide for the associates. They also are strict with management to be equally fair to all associates. Associates also have the comfort of jobs security if they only just produce the jobs they are assigned. I never saw anyone push hard to work beyond their pace.

They need to be on one accord more often. The hardest part of my job is everybody doesn't contribute the same level of teamwork so it kills the moral of certain people including me so times.

"Productive, fast paced, and constant variety:))",One of the tricky parts of my night was when we perform resets.  The cashiers have got to be off the machine at 11:45 pm.  And we can not ring up customers from 11:45 to midnight.  This allows the computer to reset for the new day and get all the totals from the previous day.  So I try to talk to my customers to make the time pass quicker.  Some times the customer will ask why aren't you checking us out?  And I explain why.  My regulars grew accustom to it.  But anytime I had new people in my line I would explain to them all.  It helped them understand what was going on and that I didn't forget about them.  And as soon as possible I would race to get everyone out the door quickly.  I also apologized for the wait.

I learned that working at Publix Supermarkets was much more rewarding and all the experience I gained was a direct result of their superior training in comparison to Wal-Mart. Management has a tendency to overlook employees who work very hard to set up and merchandise product in a professional manner and are consistent in their work. Most co-workers were decent to work with but, many had similar complaints about how they were treated. The hardest part of the job was to consistently produce the highest level of customer service and product maintenance on a daily basis and yet never feel that management was paying any attention to the amount and quality of customer service and floor maintenance you would produce every day. What I liked most about the job was after breaking down a truck and setting up the floor in an efficient and productive manner, I could step back and look at my work and be proud of it.

my walmart that i worked for could really care less about the employees,a typical day at work consisted of me doing thosands of carts buy myself and expected to get the entire lot clear by the end of the night while i have a continuous flow of carts and customers coming in and out of the store. i learned a lot of patience with this job. being able to deal with customers was something new to me until i got this job since i was the first to greet the customers and the last to say have a nice day as they walked out of the store. Management to be really honest would and should have been better. it seemed like when you had questions or wanted to be trained on something else you either got ignored or just told they will deal with it at a later date and then it never happen. in my honest opinion management could care less about their employees at least in the walmart store i worked at store number 775,3,Former Employee,Stockman/cart attendant ,"Galesburg, IL",9/16/14,2014,9,16

The majority of the time, upper management would assist us in these difficult situations, bringing an ""outnumbered"" effect to gain control.

Some of my co-workers were fine but others did absolutely NO work, or actually SLEEP. Normally I would not have cared but because it was a job that relied on us working as a team it was infuriating. If they didn't do their job it still had to get done, which left me doing more work to pick up their slack.Usually, managers would assign me to do things that were heavy while guys would be doing departments that were easy or lightweight. The hardest part of the job was probably lifting heavy furniture boxes up a ladder and putting it in top bins that were over ten feet off the ground, also management would ignore the need for a second person to do these jobs and the times when I came close to falling off of the ladder due to their negligence. Also, there was mold and roaches in the backroom, when it rained the smell of mold would be so strong that it would give me headaches.The worst is that the pay did not reflect the amount of work that I did and the third shift hours meant sacrificing any life that I once had.

Being a Mantenance Associate, it meant that I had to make sure the entire store was immaculately clean, and all by myself, without help. The management would get angry and suspect you of slacking off if they did not see you walking the isles every 15 minutes, but also required you to clean the bathrooms every 30 minutes, leaving you with a schedule impossible to complete without time travel. The customers would often defecate on the floor (and at one point on the ceiling) consistently missing or clogging the toilets, leave empty packages of shoplifted goods all over the ground, and track waste matter mixed with mud all over the floor with their shoes. The resulting mess this would cause every 15 minutes would take incredibly long to clean, and would return the moment the cleaning stopped, creating an endless cycle of going between bathrooms, and management yelling at you for taking too long.

I had to figure it out on my own. And then management would get mad at me when I didn't know the best way to do something. How am I supposed to know the best way to do it if you never taught me? They threw me on the cash register a week after hiring me with no training other than watching a video. After almost a year of working there, I still didnt learn everything my job title was supposed to know. But I did learn stuff that would help me. I eventually got the hang of the cash register, and that will definitely help. I learned how to unload the truck (which didnt seem like something you had to learn, but its actually quite a process). I learned how to manage inventory, pull picks, bin, etc. With my recent job hunt, it seems like nobody wants to train you on how to do anything.

They are understaffed on purpose, so they can force you in to do work above and beyond what is humanly possible.

Extremely cumbersome,"A typical day at the Walmart garden center would consist of me going to the cash register three days a week, but then they assigned other tasks for me to finish throughout the day.  Not many cashiers liked to be on the register, so I would always be the one to volunteer to do it.  When trying to finish a task for the day away from the register, management would get mad at me for not being at right there even though they assigned me the tasks away from the register.  I learned how to balance tasks and register and how to force myself to like some people I worked with because otherwise I would not enjoy my day.  For the most part, my coworkers were great, and so were the customers.  There were a few people I worked with, on the other hand, who thought that they were the boss and would yell at me when I didn't finish a task and would get angry when I wasn't at the register trying to finish said tasks.  Management was a mess.  I never knew whom to listen to!  I was told by several different managers to do many different things and I would not know who to pay attention to.  I finished the tasks I had started before leaving, but there would still be a lot more to do.  The manager of the entire store told me I could not rearrange my schedule because ""this was my first job and I had rearranged my schedule too much in the past.""

Just a Stepping Stone,"To be concise, working as an associate wasn't bad at all. You were kept busy and the work varied enough to not get monotonous. Being a department manager entailed a lot of politics, nepotism, and interpreting management's contradicting policies and orders (such as not having any overtime but not being allowed to leave until your area is done, with no leeway given for extenuating circumstances). Ultimately, if you've not already been there for years, or you're not planning to climb the management ladder, working for WalMart should just be a hold over until something better comes along.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Oklahoma City, OK",9/8/14,2014,9,8

I was on a rotation schedule with other Assistant Managers who taught me quite a bit from their experiences.  I do not think there is a typical day, but more of a plan your day accordingly and if something out of the ordinary happens make a quick viable solution unless it needs approval from the Store Manager.  My co-workers mainly loved me, because I was fair and understanding and new their hopes with the company and would help them get to his/her goal.

My co-workers were usually very nice. I loved that everyone shared a break room because then I was able to network with other employees from different departments, as well as my own. The most difficult part of my job was learning to do things the way other people wanted them done. Sometimes I would feel that I had a more efficient method of doing something, but it wouldn't be the way the department wanted them done so we would do them a different way.

"Fast paced, and repetetive, with little reward.","A typical day includes the same things as any day, nothing changes._x000D_Inventory is so repetitive and mind numbingly easy that I feel Walmart should just train monkeys to do it, rather than give people just over a dollar above minimum wage to do it. The easy part is just of what it consists, the tasks and what you are required to do is easy. The amount of the work is a different story. There's always a lot to do, always something to do, but never enough people to do it._x000D__x000D_  A small majority of my co-workers are all hard working, honest, and nice people.

Wouldn't recommend,"A typical day at work at Wal-Mart varies, some days are easier than others and some are extremely stressful. Management doesn't know much about what is happening in the facility, such as higher ranking personnel harassing employees. I also found that (even though they are not supposed to) they would force employees to stay well after their assigned shifts to finish work, then cut their hours the next work day. And with a shifting schedule, it is hard to have a life outside of work.

Working with co-workers is enjoyable especially since we are a team. The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping the patient.

Overall I hated working at Walmart it was a horrible experience.,"When first arriving to work I would check the store case to see what needed to be put out for the day for the customers to purchase. After the case was filled with everything in its mid, I then had to check to see if their was any special cake orders to be filled. Once all of the cakes were done I was responsible for making sure that the bakery was cleaned thoroughly. I learned allot from working in the bakery, I came into the job with no prior decorating knowledge. Even though I didn't have any proper training, my co workers were more than willing to help me learn. With constant practice and watching my co workers I quickly picked up on decorating. Management was horrible. The bakery's department manager quit in my second month of being there, so for a while it was just coworkers in the bakery. My coworkers were really nice, if it wasn't for them I wouldn't know anything about cake decorating. I really appreciate everything they did. The hardest part about working in Walmart's bakery is the lack of professionalism. There is never a reason that i BAKERY should run out of cupcakes!!! We would run out of icing, cakes anything you name it! The most enjoyable part about working in the bakery was definitely the actual cake decorating.

"Pretty Great, but there's a few things that I would change.","Walmart is not a good place to work.A perk is that they schedule you around whatever you got going on. I 'm currently a full time student in college, and I am able to go to classes in the morning then go to work. .Management isn't all soft like some places. They expect you to get stuff done and they will coach you if you can't make it happen. It's pretty easy to move up in the company if you work hard and communicate to management that you want to move up, then odds are you will. The people however, leave something to be desired. A lot of people that work at Walmart constantly complain about their jobs and they don't work hard. Some of the older guys and gals work plenty hard and they make work bearable. Same for my friends that work with me. But people at walmart are rude and will often ignore you when you try to help them. The pay is not very good. its good for a part time job, but when you're trying to support yourself like I am, then you would be better off finding a job somewhere else. There is an employee discount, but it is rather terrible. Otherwise, benefits are pretty much non existent for hourly employees starting out. After 6 months you get opportunities for bonuses, which are really good. They are pretty much another paycheck. You get a raise after every year you work there. There is insurance as far as I know, but you have to pay for it. Walmart doesn't pay for it. You can get small repairs done on your glasses at the Eye Center for free, but that's it. It is really hard to lose your job. You pretty much have to never show up and do nothing when you do show up - more...",3,Current Employee,Grocery Associate ,"Sherman, TX",9/3/14,2014,9,3

A chaotic mess.,"The unloading crew currently has the most problems. There's no one to supervise them and everything is always in a chaotic mess. Only a handful of managers actually know what they are doing and it seems like no one gets trained on how to do stuff properly. The store itself is a mess, prices are missing, etc. The store manager is indecisive and can't take action on anything. He is oblivious to the store's overall problems and doesn't fix things glaring him right in the face. The store needs way more leadership and direction from everyone higher up, as the people in charge now take advantage of their break times and like to pretend they don't have many responsibilities or people under them that they should be trying manage and make better workers.",2,Current Employee,ICS Associate ,"Rochester, NY",9/3/14,2014,9,3

Ungreatful Management,"Worked at Walmart for over 4 years. It is, on most days, very stressful. I was a Customer Service Manager for 3 years and most of time the workload was unreasonable. They expect 1 person to do the Job of 4 on minimum wage. No matter how hard you work and if you get everything done you were ask for, you hardly ever hear any praise from Management. _x000D_The yearly evaluations are a joke, no chance of ever getting a decent raise unless you move up. I worked there for over 4 years and never was offered or had the chance to become Fulltime. The store I worked at based their raises, promotions etc on how well you can suck up to Management instead of how good you do your Job. You get called in to work on your day off but you cant go over your scheduled hours without getting in trouble. No overtime! If you go over your scheduled hours without Management approval you got to either leave early, take long lunch or get in major trouble if you even have 5 min. of overtime. Cant miss more then 3 days of work within 6 month without getting wrote up. Benefits for Part time employees are a joke. You got to be with Walmart for 2 years before you qualify for paid time off. Sick pay is also a joke since you do not get paid if you call in sick for 1 day. I think the best part of Walmart is the discountcard and even that has it downfalls since the discount does not apply for groceries.",3,Former Employee,Cuctomer Service Manager ,"Morrilton, AR",9/3/14,2014,9,3

Decent place but I was personally denied advancement multiple times despite my hard work.,A typical day at work was overall good. Management was almost always helpful with most things as well as co-workers. The hardest part of working there was watching newer associates move up while they kept me in the same spot they wanted me in because no one did the job the way I did and others refused to learn. The most enjoyable part was the hours. They were very negotiable and schedules were posted weeks in advance.,3,Former Employee,Front End Associate ,"201 34th street North.

All the walmarts ive worked at all the employees are really nice and welcoming, The hardest part of the job would be to maintain the cleanliness of the store especially on busy weekends. I loved how fast i could move up at this company. i also loved learning new things such as sales and goals. A typical day for opening for a zms would be get your daily notes, execute them by 11am and follow up on the department managers on their daily routines, prepare the 2pm unloading plan and tour your areas.

Walmart,"A typical day at work starts with clocking in and finding a register that you will be occupying for the first two hours of your shift. Once at the register, first start by wiping everything down with cleaner and a cloth, setting everything up where you would like it and when done turn your light on to show customers that your lane is open. Once you have a customer they will set their things up on the belt and you grab the items to scan them and put into bags for them. For a full shift you will get two fifteen minute breaks and an hour lunch. Each time coming back from your break or lunch you will scan your badge to find out which register you will be occupying for the time being. At the end of the day you turn off your light at your register and gather your things, hangers, extra bags, ext, go to the service desk and dispose of them in the appropriate bins. Once everything is cleaned up from your station, you can go clock out and go home. I've learned many things at Walmart. I've learned how to cash payroll checks, how to send and receive money orders and money grams. I've learned how to decipher between a legit license and a fake license.

A good starter job,"Having worked similar retail jobs, I can fairly say that Wal-Mart has a better system in general. Scheduling 2 weeks in advance can make it difficult to make appointments, but otherwise work-life balance is fair.  Opportunities to earn up to a dollar per hour more per year, and starting higher than minimum wage, with incentives for working night and Sunday shifts.  Overtime is available but not often required. Benefits are competitive, and advancement opportunities abound.

Okay Job,"I generally didn't mind working at Walmart. There were always things to do, from dealing with customers to binning merchandise to odd jobs. I liked the social atmosphere of the place, and I liked having the feeling that I was personally responsible for my own work. I learned a great deal about how to work in the retail industry, since I previously had almost no training. My management was typically helpful, but extremely scarce. They basically decided we were adults, and could fend for ourselves. Which was fine, but every now and then, you'd need them, and had to hunt the store for them. My coworkers were pretty interesting, and I learned to work as part of a team._x000D_The hardest part of my job was my schedule. I'd have to cancel family appointments, meetings with friends, etc. because the schedule couldn't be counted on to be the same from week to week. The daily schedule was actually insane. You were expected not to work overtime, because the company wanted to save money (seriously, it was counted against you) so you had to leave early every day. This meant you'd either have to rush out before a supervisor caught you and assigned work that would ""just take a minute"" or a customer stopped you, or you could say forget it and do the job and deal with the customer, and ask to edit your time later. _x000D_The second hardest was the odd customer that would threaten you or be rude, but you could sometimes refer them to supervisors._x000D_The best part of my job, was doing something new, a tough job that took much of the day, but when it was done you were completely relieved.

Management at this Walmart seemed more multifaceted then I liked. They are extremely approachable, very helpful and will always lend an ear. Some of the managers, while being there for the employees, seemed to have their own agenda. While someone needed a day or part of a day off for medical reasons they were allowed. On some occasions extended vacations where allowed to certain sales associates if requested within reasonable time frames. On the down side, sometimes when extended time off was needed for medical reasons, it got denied due to availability (They were key people that actually did work and they never got the true help they needed, sadly). Most of the time, management was great and willing to give hours in other areas in the store to those that needed._x000D__x000D_Though benefits were provided, they were not all that great.

No one wanted to be there because there was no job security,"Every single day we were afraid of being given the pink slip. Everyday we didn't know if we would have a job at the end of the shift or not. Management would yell at us from various things; for asking a CSM a question, for asking to go to the restroom when we weren't busy, for taking medicine, for having surgery, etc etc. For the time I was there I saw a lot of people be fired for the most random things. One person was fired because her car got snowed in and she couldn't make her shift. Another was fired for injuring her back. There was even one who was fired for having to have surgery. They never wanted to negotiate anything. I lived an hour away from my store and they would try to have me leave at midnight and come back at six in the morning. When I told them why they couldn't do that they would get snippy with me and tell me that I could do it because I'm young. I don't think that they understood that I would not get home until after 1AM, go to bed by 2AM, have to get up by 4AM to leave by 5AM to get there by 6AM. They didn't do this to just me either. We had some college students who had a set schedule and management refused to follow their schedule. They ended up quitting because school was more important than working for a company who won't adjust to a school schedule. Also, none of the CSMs or Managers were co-ordinated.

"Great place to work, fun and educational","A typical day I clocked in, went out to the floor to see if any freight had been left from the night before, put it out or labeled it and put it in the stock room.  I got a Texlon and did some ordering if needed, cleaned up as I went, helped customers as I went.  If the department manager had a list for me to do I would do it.  She taught me a lot about how to run the department and what to do to boost sales. I usual worked at least part of the day with another associate in my department.  We always worked well together.  When I first started it was hard I worked both jobs head start in the morning and Walmart in the evening, at first it was just an escape from head start, and all that was going on there, then it was all Walmart. where I worked there was two department managers and they had two different teaching styles.  One was furniture and one was domestics, it was crazy but I got through it.  The best part of my job was the customers.  They were kind and understanding.  I would walk around the store before I clocked in to learn where things were and if there were any changes.  I loved my job, I couldn't wait to go to work.

Great way to earn experience,"In the past 7 years I have leaned quite a bit working with Walmart.  If you show interest in learning other areas of the store, you will most definitely be trained in those areas. Since I showed interest, I learned the whole store, 1st-3rd shift, which helped me advance to my supervisor position. The pay is not so great but it is a stable job.  Managers come and go though. Some of them will like you and some will not, which will limit how far you can move up. They do what they want with who they hire for certain spots and are very biased sometimes.  Overall, everyone is friendly.  They do not want to work with availability any more though.  You are married to Walmart if you work there.  The job isn't hard, but I do love what I do. My associates sometimes complain but they do have the hardest and least compensated job in the store. Unloading trucks IS a task. Other than that, Walmart is an easy job if you are willing to just do what is asked of you, even though your job title may not entail it, if management deems it necessary you will be scrubbing toilets and pushing buggies.",3,Current Employee,Inventory Supervisor ,"Chester, SC",9/1/14,2014,9,1

This is a rolling 6 months a day falls off after 6 months.  They play favorites,  If your in the inner circle you could almost get away with murder.  If not you make a mistake you suffer for what in their eyes you did wrong.  It has been said that the customer is not always right and they will play by our rules.  Depending on the customer, they would get what they asked for others complete denial for virtually the same thing.  There is no unity there.  It is though each manager makes their own rules.

Micro-management!,"I've been working at Walmart for almost 3 months now. I used to come in, bouncy and chipper, with a smile on my face and a go-to attitude to help the customers in any way I can. Now, I was hired to work in the garden department, but then without my agreement, I've been switched to the  toy department. I used to wok at Toys R Us during the holidays and that alone was a pain but working at Walmart during off-season is worst. I have 3 Hispanic ladies who are assistant managers toss me back and forth between zoning and go-backs. Now you all know what those are. Zoning is going up and down the aisles, making sure everything is nice and neat and taking out things that don't belong in the toy aisle. Go-backs are taking toys from the customer service department and putting them back where their homes are. I work alone in the massive toy department and I swear, I'm not making this up nor am I exaggerating. I don't mind working toys. I kinda play with them a little when no one is around to amuse myself and keep myself from crawling in the corner and crying from the stress the ""managers' are putting on me. I get along with my co-workers just fine and a few of the department managers. I am called on register 3-4 times a day, which is fine. But I end up skipping out on my last 15 minute breaks to try and please these managers.

With the photo lab department, I taught/showed customers how to use the machines so they can print off photo's as well as taking pictures for customers passport photos. The managers at Walmart are very helpful and glad to help any customer or associate in need. They go out of their way to help fellow associates with training to move up in the company. My fellow co-workers were all friendly and very work oriented, I worked with a few ""veterans"" to Walmart or associates who have worked with the company for years and have moved up.

Life as a Wal-Mart Associate.,"A typical morning/afternoon at Wal-Mart is pretty much the same routine everyday depending on what's in the notes that your manager has, but overall our main goal is to work freight, double check other work from the night before and get it binned so there are no pallets full of your departments freight in receiving, in a days work not only do you just work freight to the shelves you have returns you have to check on, customers that need help and you also have mods and features that have to get done, you can get pulled from your department at any time and be put somewhere else, busy or not. You have to make sure your department is also zoned so it's easier for costumers to find merchandise and so it's neat because that department reflects on you. I've learned that no matter what to work hard and  get your job done and not worry about anyone else, don't let your work slow down or get sidetracked by things that are not important on the job, people are going to dislike you, you just have to keep going, be nice, and show that it doesn't bother you because in the end you will be the one rewarded. Management is a big part of course, you have some who take pride in what they do and some who pick and choose favorites and take advantage of their job title and know how to play victim very well and get away with it. For the most part management is very understanding and cares about their associates and want to make sure they are taken care of and treated fairly.

In need of a maricle,"Had the my gain of skill through this industry but had no support in doing so. Management is non-supportive and in need of training themselves.

Teamwork is essential at the workplace,"I would start my a\day at 1400 and work until 2300. I provided customers with excellent customer service. I learned how to drive a forklift, scissor lift and a ""walkie stacker"" ( a standing forklift without the propane tank). I assembled all kinds of bicycles there. I also moved out of ""the hole"" as management called it, and have some fun in the sun at their lawn and garden department. To be honest, my coworkers rotated or stopped working so randomly there, it kept it interesting for management of the department. I knew what was expected of me and I performed the job well. That fact about new coworkers being assigned so frequent may have been the hardest part of the job. It was hard to get a good feel for a routine or schedule going there; to better the efficiency of the department.

THe job is a salary position that will drain away most of your free time and has no set weekly schedule.,The job starts out fun and rewarding but you quickly get thrown into the deep of it. Most managers are out for themselves and will throw you under the bus the first chance they get in order to avoid getting in trouble. They stress teamwork but punish the ones who help others.

An exciting day of Wal-Mart,"The day starts off with coming in and clearing the trouble shoot and resolving the problems with prescriptions. Either it being too soon to fill, insurance problems, waiting for doctors, or just double billing. Then it is time to input all the prescriptions that have been electronically sent in from doctor offices and drop the called in prescriptions from the doctor offices and faxed ones as well. While completing that process I take customer, doctor, and insurance phone calls as well as taking care of patients at drop off and pick up as well as helping the customer questions on locating the items for the store. Later on in the day I complete the return to stock that is the medications that haven't been picked up after ten days and put them away. At about that time its time to receive the orders and drop them into the systems and put them on the shelves and fill more prescriptions until the day is over. I have learned how to be a pharmacy technician and the medications names and uses and so much more from the time I entered this exciting field. The pharmacists at my store have helped me so much in guiding me into where I am now and continuing to teach me new things day to day.

Most of the managers were young people straight out of college with no managemental skill. The hardest part of working at Wal-Mart was definitely the customers.

I  truly loved my jobs because i had the chance to interact with many different customers and help them with there needs. I love that even if i was having a bad day i still wanted my customers to be happy. You will run into some lazy co-workers that would drive me crazy but as long as the work was done. i felt like the pay should have been more because you are required to do a lot  of work in 7 hours. Sometimes i did mine and others work.

Hard work with average pay,"A typical day of work at Wal-Mart left me tired, but manageable. I would show up sometime around 9pm for the shift-meeting. We would all stand around the main entrance of the work-area (back of the store) and the managers would give us a summary of the work load ahead of us and any shortages that we had in workforce. They did their best to encourage us to stretch and go into the workday with a bright outlook, though high workloads that were beyond their control often had us dragging more and more as each day went by. We would go to work immediately after the shift-meeting and begin unpacking and shelving merchandise, answering questions for customers, and checking that prices and organization were all correct. Two breaks and a lunch later, we went home, typically on time, but I was asked to work longer several times due to the workforce being too small for the workload to be done in the correct amount of time._x000D__x000D_The management was definitely supportive and made the draining and difficult job as easy to do, and our nights as easy to get through as possible. We would sometimes have pizza or donuts ordered to bring up morale.

The management at Wal-mart for the most part were pretty fair and helpful throughout the time I worked at Wal-mart. The hardest part of the job was sometimes not knowing the answers to questions that some of the customers asked, though I went above and beyond to assist them.

Fast pace enviroment with many opportunities to grow in the company.,A typical day involves pulling items from the back stock that is low or out on the shelf.

There are audits that have to be completed through out the day to assure that all items that are placed in a bin are scanned in. Cleaning the back room and organizing any left over items on pallets for the next shift to pick up where first shift left off. I have a few co-workers that contribute to the same roles I have and two supervisors and a manager that are over my department. The hardest part is pulling heavy items from the top shelves. I enjoy my whole job and I learn something new almost everyday. I have learned to use the handheld equipment to keep track of the amount of each item that is in the store.

Walmart is a good starting position,"I definitely learned a lot about what it means to get stuff done and completed in a  timely manner.  A typical day at work consists of helping customers with what they need and engaging in friendly conversation. I also complete tasks by management and ring on a register. I keep records of things I have completed. The hardest part about the job is the management doesn't always treat people the friendliest especially for the amount of work they ask of you. A lot of people have this common complaint that they feel like there always asked to do much in a place with not enough help, and still never appreciated. Although it's a good start out job, for someone looking to get by or make money. However,  some good things is that the scheduling at walmart is the best part, you make your own availability and can change it at any time.

Working at Wal-Mart you meet good co-workers that will help you out in any situation you may face working there. the hardest part of the job was trying to get more hours to work in one week because we got paid every other week the most enjoyable was interacting with costumers on a daily basis. The management to me was very good I had no problem with them if you had a problem at home with outside problems like going to the hospital with one of your relatives or had to go to a doctors appointment yourself they would work with you and reschedule you on other days you got off or help you find other co-works to trade schedules so that you can get what you have to do out the way.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Conway, SC",8/22/14,2014,8,22
