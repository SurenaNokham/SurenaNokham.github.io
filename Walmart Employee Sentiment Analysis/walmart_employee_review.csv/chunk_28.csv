Good if you're looking for a quick buck,"Walmart is good company to work for if you are not ambitious and just need a source of income. They do not pay good compare to similar jobs, but there are opportunities for advancement and moving around in the company. The worst aspect is the job culture is awful. Barely a day goes by that you won't hate your job.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Coventry, RI",6/27/17,2017,6,27

Friendly and respectful staff,"Working in the Maintenance Department at the Walmart Distribution Center outside of Cheyenne, WY was nice because of how friendly and respectful the staff is to the people who work there.  They usually take into consideration whether someone has a condition that he/she cannot help and still gives them an opportunity with another job and/or to work with somebody else to get some things taken care of.  Although, sometimes they are a bit too flexible on allowing rules to be broken.",4,Former Employee,Maintenance Worker ,"Cheyenne, WY",6/27/17,2017,6,27
Not For Me,Easy job but there were too many supervisors for one shift. Multiple directions received from multiple supervisors.  Most contradicting the other.  Unreasonable output goals for certain areas.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Nashville-Davidson, TN",6/27/17,2017,6,27

a typical day,I loved working at wal-mart. While I worked there I was attending college and they made it possible for me to do that.

You can go anywhere with walmart.,Walmart is an equal opportunity employer and if you work hard you can advance very quickly. It has a management team that is willing to help with anything you need. The benefits are not very good and their insurance is expensive.,4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Poteau, OK",6/27/17,2017,6,27

No,"This company has poor management system, they just look out for _x000D_themselves, when a employee performs nothing works to his convenience.

Decent Workplace,"Working at Walmart is not a bad thing, the workers are friendly, the pay is decent for retail and there are lots of opportunities for advancement. As a sales associate, the work was easy and versatile. As you move up in the company though you get less help and not much is explained to you by upper management, you are pretty much on your own with little to no explanation. The company as a whole is implementing measures to try and prevent it but it may take some time. We do have lots of small events like safety parties or monthly birthdays and everyone is pretty close with one another. I loved being busy and having things to do all day everyday but the stress is a little much.",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"West Jordan, UT",6/27/17,2017,6,27

cashier at walmart,"a typical work day at wal-mart would be me punching in checking in at customer service and getting on a register. Greeting customers, collecting via cash, credit debit or checks. working at walmart I learned about sick paid time off and how to get ahead in a career. The management were pretty fair but the work place culture was a little ghetto. The hardest part about working at walmart was nothing. easy part was everything.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Hamden, CT",6/27/17,2017,6,27
Not Recommended,"Working for Walmart is in no way a fun job.  As part of CAP 2 (truck unloaders and stockers), the blame for many things is laid upon us.  The truck and/or trucks are never done fast enough (even when they are), the freight is never stocked fast enough (even if the task time exceeds our shift time), and we are often expected to do the job of an entire department's worth of people without regard to the fact that our team is shorthanded.  Management does not seem to care, and keeps piling on the workload and raising their expectations.  We are paid the same as everyone else in the store, but our job is far more dangerous.  Trucks come in some days looking like the freight was literally thrown in haphazardly, and people have had extremely heavy objects fall on or near them.  I work with and have met some great people at this job, but those people and receiving a paycheck are the only things keeping me here.  I will jump at the chance to leave once I find something else.",1,Current Employee,CAP Team 2 Associate ,"Coventry, RI",6/27/17,2017,6,27
Lack of coordinated leadership,"Walmart is the industry leader in retail sales.  It is very disappointing that local management cannot come in line with national management.  For those employees wishing to do the right this for the customer, you will find it frustrating.  It is a culture of putting out what ever fire is in front on them, when simple planning and follow up on execution would alleviate at least 50% of wasted productivity.",3,Former Employee,SUPPORT MANAGER ,"Palmetto, FL",6/27/17,2017,6,27
Your typical retail employer,"I've enjoyed my experience at Walmart at various points, and have not enjoyed it at others. Over the years, I've worked for wonderful supervisors, and some that were not so wonderful. Working holidays puts a strain on your family and personal life, but that is the nature of the business.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Department Manager ,"East Stroudsburg, PA",6/27/17,2017,6,27

Cut Throat,VERY cutthroat. Everyone was against everyone else. Management was not unbias and had favorites. Rules everywhere and could be fired for any reason without review. Hard to avoid pitfalls and writeups because of the backstabbing.,2,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Hamilton, AL",6/27/17,2017,6,27
"Busy, productive work place","During a typical day in the Deli at Wal-Mart is you check in with the other deli associates to see what you should begin with. You were expected to keep up with the hot cases, rotisseries, frying, meats and chesses slicing, cleaning counters, prep areas, and slicers, and showcases through out the day. You also prepped special orders, salads, and sandwiches. At the end of the day you needed to have everything turned off and locked down as well as floors swept and mopped, dishes cleaned, all counters, prep areas, showcases, and slicers cleaned and sanitized and garbage taken out. You also needed to have all left over food properly put away or throw away and the showcases stocked. My favorite shifts to have there was closing. My least favorite part of the job was when items were  moved or not put in the right places and taking care of rotten meats and cheeses (the smell was atrocious).  The only part of management I didn't like was the fact that it often changed and there are a lot of management positions and sometimes you don't always know who to report to, it can get confusing.",4,Former Employee,Deli Aide ,"Mansfield, PA",6/27/17,2017,6,27
Harsh,When they train there employees they don't really teach them the job they want you to do. They start in area that  has five areas to work plus help customers.

informative and helpful,while working for Walmart i always felt welcome to bring my ideas to the table. the meetings helped inform and motivate me in a silly yet friendly way. when i was stressed i could remove myself from the floor and do things in the back rooms allowing my to blow steam or relax until i was in a better state to help aid the customers in any way needed.,5,Former Employee,Cashier/Stocker ,"Palmyra, ME",6/27/17,2017,6,27
Dreadful place. Easily confused with hot place called H**l,"My experience is from an overnight cashiers point of view. First few months in weren't so bad, I was a happily hopeful employee of one of the counties biggest corporations. I enjoyed people and could connect with others easily. Unfortunately Walmart does not care about their associates. Having ongoing injury collected me a few days off, plus being worked to the bone (9-14 days in a row sometimes) brought serious stress and lack of sleep to the table mixed with preexisting mental illness gave me anxiety attacks and even fainting in one instance. That place is H**L! Anyone who works there hates their life! Well what life Walmart gives you time for that is....",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,Pa,6/27/17,2017,6,27

"Had fun working here, but the employees were terrible","People I didn't even know were very rude to me. These are the employees that work out on the floor. They act like they are better because you are just a cashier. On top of it, they try to boss you around, and are overall rude to everyone.

I was constantly busy with assisting customers and putting away new shippments as they came in. I learned that for me I loved making the customers happy. Management could be confusing at times. I would have so many people that had a certain opinion on how something should be done. The hardest part was keeping all of management happy on days like this.

Store Operation,"Working for Walmart on a day to day basis has been a honor and a wonderful experience to have under my belt.  A typical day at work includes a large amount of walking, constantly helping customers through out the store and aiding other associates in the backroom.  Walmart has shown me how to lead a team in a retail environment and how to work with other members of management to provide proper customer service.  All in all the management team that I have operated under and with has been a roller coaster of good and bad; I have operated under a total of 4 co-managers to the singular store manager.  The hardest part of my job on a day to day basis is constantly keeping up with the store and being ahead of the crowd to ensure that my orders are sent out in a certain amount of time for the online customers.  I enjoy constantly being involved and thrown into a social environment and forcing myself to interact with customers and associates to ensure a successful day at work; it is always a great feeling when a customer is satisfied with their experience at my store.  Becoming a manager for the online shipping I have learned many many things that I would have never expected to pick up working at Walmart some of them include, working machinery, becoming much more familiar with microsoft offices, meeting coordination, inventory accuracy, greatly improving interactions with customers on a daily basis, phone service and sales.",5,Current Employee,Warehouse Manager ,"Fishkill, NY",6/26/17,2017,6,26

Some of the management is really good and will help you but normally they will just tell you what to do and just leave you. I wasn't even formally trained on half the stuff that I did.

Decent Workplace with Decent Benefits,"This review is based solely on experiences at Walmart 01036. Beginning pay at Walmart is higher than almost any other place for new employees, but the company does not care about it's employees anymore. Employees who have been with the store for 10+ years receive the same pay, or slightly more than new hires. The store does not accept doctor's notes for medical emergencies (miscarriages, heart attacks, death in the family, etc. The store cuts hours by more than 20 hours unexpectedly. The managers show favoritism toward employees (some employees are denied raises for invalid reasons, while other employees with same circumstances will receive raises). There has been unaddressed reported acts of inappropriate conduct by managers. The store powers down the A/C and heat at night, disregarding the comfort of third shift employees. However, as opposed to the three strikes you receive at other stores, at Walmart, you receive 9 strikes before you are fired. An employee meeting giving a brief overview of insights and freight numbers and employee departments begins a typical night at Walmart. Then, employees are sent to designated departments to work 1-15 pallets of freight, depending on the truck load that night. Employees are given two 15 minute breaks and one 1 hour lunch break.",2,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Forest City, NC",6/25/17,2017,6,25

"It's a good company to work for, depending on your own personal career goals.","I worked for Wal-Mart for seven and a half years.

He eventually left the company. It WAS a fun place to work. There was room for growth with the company, but only if you knew someone or were favored over someone else. The four years following, my experience was not so great. The management team did not care about the associates (in my previous store). They do not care about your medical health or family obligations.

"Understaffed, Management is unappreciative, Blamed for uncontrollable events","Management changes their minds frequently on tasks; blamed for not completing some. Associates are awesome, and the only reason I have stayed for two years; they see the real issues in the store, and are good to talk with for ideas. Salaried Management, except maybe three good people, only cares about themselves and their advancement. If they're to blame for something, they can and will pin the blame on you; if they want you gone then they will try anything they can to get you to quit, or get you fired. It's very easy to get on Management's bad side merely by going to them about your department's issues; i.e. I work in the food area, and there is rust and mold in my department, which they don't seem to care about._x000D_ The store has been understaffed for the longest time, and shows no signs of improving.

"large company, promotes from within","the general rule to be promoted is you have to have already be doing the job next level up for one year to get the promotion.

Horrible place to work,Ok place to work if you don't mind being worked hard with very low pay. No team unity in Walmart and management is very unfriendly and ignores their associates.

ok,my opinion about a typical day work is that I clock in and then find out what register I will be at then go to that register and start my day. I have learned a lot of the customers are nice and some are not. management at Walmart is ok they could work on how they treat their employees in front of others.

equal opportunity workplace!,"Walmart is a great place to work because the benefits are great if you've been there for a year. i enjoyed my job in the deli helping customers and cooking food. I found it difficult to request for a set schedule due to the amount of associates going in an out of employment there. I really enjoyed going about my daily duties of slicing meat for customers, fulling orders at the fryer, baking pizza etc. I learned many skills such as time-management and teamwork. the management is a bit discombobulated but that comes with having multiple levels of management on one store. At times it seemed impossible to get any manager to answer the phone or walkie and if you requested to move departments or change your schedule it takes weeks for the request to go through all members of management. The hardest part of my job was closing some nights alone, getting everything done in the time given is very difficult but not impossible. the best part of my job was fry cooking, it is a new skill for me but i have become very skillful in it.",3,Former Employee,deli associate for almost a year and feel ,"Lutz, FL 33549",6/21/17,2017,6,21

Unfriendly work environment. No support or enough help,"Walmart can be a good and fun place to work but sadly management is always fussing at you and you are always understaffed in every department. They never hire enough people for the job. They cut hours too often and try to get 5 to do the job of 15. Management will never back you up and you are always left to defend yourself. Walmart is not a team based company anymore. Nobody strives to help one another. Management is too set on trying to get the job done than making their associates and customers happy. Because if you make your associates happy and treat them right then they will then in turn make your customers happy. But it doesn't seem like management or anyone higher seems to care about that anymore.

They say coaching is something they do to teach you again lies. Home Office needs to take a look at this and do an overhaul. Just know you're expendable. They may make you feel important and needed but know there is another ""Joe"" in line for your job. Management made me and others as an associate feel as though it was them vs. us.

Not So Bad,"I have worked at Walmart for almost 5 years now. It's not my ideal job by any means. But it's steady work and there are a variety of shifts to choose from that will work with almost any ones schedule. Management can be unrealistic and favoritism is present.

"Good place to work, mostly ...",Walmart's top management was professional and most often trustworthy. The middle management seemed more and more flippant - quite discouraging. The employee reviews were done yearly and were based on store profit - not performance - so  associates quit or kept floating through different departments.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Howell, MI",6/20/17,2017,6,20
Enjoyed working with people,"A typical day at work could vary, depending on what time of year it was and if we were short staffed, which was very often. Although I loved working with the customers and being around people sometimes the job could get stressful, management changed a lot and we never had enough employees to work with us so it made the job so hard sometimes when it was non-stop busy. I learned to multi-task and how to solve most problems without having to call for a manager.",4,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate/Cashier ,"Lockport, NY",6/20/17,2017,6,20
Wal-Mart DC,Excellent place to start with Wal-Mart to see a new side of the company. Depending on the job position there is a lot of stuff to learn at the warehouse.

Good pay for the job,"Working at Walmart had a lot of its pros and cons. For the work, the pay was good. However, the managers weren't very understanding. For example, they had a policy where if you have legitimate reason, you wouldn't be 'pointed' (which is kind of like being penalized), for missing out on work. Yet, fainting on the job received a point. Some girl who went into labor on the job got pointed as well, if I remember correctly.

Meaning Career,"A lot of people don't think of Walmart as the best place to build a career. I did a management internship with Walmart while finishing my undergrad and returned to the company shortly after graduating college. As far as retail management goes I don't think there is a better company out there to work for. Assistant Managers start off at $48,500 and have the option to get 15% of salary as a bonus in the Spring at the end of the fiscal year. There are a lot of responsibilities and absolutely a lot of stress but in the end can be very rewarded if you are good at managing numbers and leading people. You are definitely viewed in terms of your results and not your effort. Sometimes you can work day in and day off trying your hardest to see improvements that never come so if you want a career that is going to reward you for effort this is not it. Advancement is great as well. All ASMs are almost expected to move in the company at some point, your entire career as an assistant is to prepare you for one day running your own store. Co Manager is the next step, they have an ever higher starting salary and much larger bonus plan. Store managers can see a salary easily of $80k-$100k and have the ability to double their salary with their bonus. If you have great management/retail skills, love working with people, are willing to put in a lot of hard work, and want to work for a company with a great company culture than I highly recommend it.",4,Current Employee,ASSISTANT STORE MANAGER ,Ohio,6/20/17,2017,6,20

great teachers and everyone is friendly.,My typical day at work was to go and clock in and then go into the lot and collect the carts then proceeded to take them to the corrals.

Salaried management mostly dwells up on a mountain and does not like to be disturbed. Non-salaried management, while mostly nice people, are condemned to the social netherworld, neither proleteriat, nor bourgeoisie._x000D_Hardest Part: It's depressing.

Walmart,"Working as an Unloader/ IMS Associate at Walmart is ultimately not a bad job, if you like to be moving constantly. I enjoyed my job when I first began working as an Unloader. But there is favortism that goes on, and a major lack of communication through management that frequently causes unnecessary confusion and conflict. There are quite a few great people to surround yourself with, but there are also those who enjoy conflict as you will find anywhere you go. I learned some things as an Unloader, but I would have liked to learn more. I frequently asked to be trained in new things, and taught new things and have been denied due to short staffing and lack of communication through management. The best and worst part of the work day is unloading the trucks. It is the worst because it is the most fast paced part of the day, constant movement for 2-3 hours; depending on how long it took to unload the truck that day. It is also the worst part of the day because it is constant lifting, for 0-100 pounds, with or without help. But it is also the best part of the day because as your unloading the truck you have anywhere from 3-6 other associates that you can talk ammongst and you have a good time while working on the truck; which makes for a good start of a day.",3,Former Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Jackson, MI 49202",6/20/17,2017,6,20

It was a good job,"A typical day of work started with clocking into a machine, where you would later start being told what to do by young kids with a yellow vest that had authority to tell you what to do, It also consisted of waiting three hours for a break and putting up with attitudes from managers if you reminded them that you needed to take a break. It was the worst hostile environment and I wish someone could have witnessed what I experienced there at that work place, It was hard enough to not see any managers willing to help or even offer their assistance when you were having trouble with a customer.

It's okay.,"Overall, Wal-Mart isn't as bad as it used to be. There is a program they have that takes about 4 months to complete, and after it, you get a $1.00/hr. raise. While you are hired to work in a specific department, you will be working everywhere, including cashiering. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part is having the patients for the customers, and management, and if you are working 3rd shift, time. On 3rd shift, you must stock shelves with a very strict time limit, and breaking that limit immediately gets you reprimanded._x000D__x000D_However, your co-workers are typically good people to talk to on your frequent breaks (about 1 break every 2 hours). It's possible to make some new friends with the people you work with. The benefits are pretty good as well. They also have a policy where if you are off the clock, you cannot and should not work. As soon as your shift is up, you safely stow everything you were working on, clock-out, and go home._x000D__x000D_The most enjoyable part is helping a customer with what they need, and exceeding their expectations.

Most do not participate in the productivity of the store. They are horrible at giving direction and often it varies from one manager to the next. Listening and following through are not skills required to be a manager at this company either. Also the customers here are very difficult.

When the downturn in the economy in 1997, I went to work for Walmart, and because of my knowledge in the paint, automotive and hardware departments from my previous jobs, I was perfect for that job. I was able to match color's to customer needs. Most enjoyable part of that job was the interaction with the customers.  Management was at times not understanding the time it took to provide great customer service. Walmart management was not fully aware of what the job consisted of and did not understand what the customers expected from my paint department, as I was able to solve just about anything that was of concern in my department, and because management knew very little about what was needed for my customers, I was fired for spending to much time with an elderly couple that had concern's about the ""how to do"" the project they were about to start. I still say customer service is very important to any retail job and I offer only the best service in each and every customer that my department calls for.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Longview, WA",6/19/17,2017,6,19

Very demanding job in terms of customer service, I would chat with customers as well as assist them in making educated purchases based around electronics. I would often be thrown around the store to different departments because of a lack of employees, it would be very frustrating especially because you had to get work done for multiple departments and would get in trouble if you didn't finish your main department.

I have two kids and was a full time student and they said they would work with me and I told them I had to get everything situated and find a consistent babysitter for my kids and I might be late because it was hard for me to find a babysitter that woke up at 4 am so I can drop the kids off. They pointed me so many times for being late and missing because I didn't have a babysitter in February and I even warned them. the management sucks and they have favorites and if you don't kiss their butts they will fire you and a lot of people call in all the time and are late to work and they take their points off but for a hard working mother of two they can't work with me and give me another chance and fire me leaving me with out income for my kids ticked me off hate Walmart and the managers.,1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Broken Arrow, OK",6/18/17,2017,6,18

Not Great,"A typical day at work involved standing at the end of the register-aisle for one or two hours, not allowed to sit, while waiting for customers to check out. I learned that customers do not consider retail employees as ""people,"" they consider them ""the help"" or ""the workers."" Management was not organized, even during inspections, nor were they sympathetic to any lower-ranked employee's concerns. Fellow employees were very nice and supportive; the break-room was cold and only the floor was clean. The hardest part of being a cashier was the pressure to scan items faster than 200/minute at entry-level; in my first ten days I was unfairly compared to another employee whom had been working as a cashier for six months; new cashiers were often told that we would be ""let go"" if we could not meet the speed of more-experienced coworkers.

Dealing with people's photos I get to to a certain point live a little through them. Walmart has quarterly bonuses if criteria is met, a 401, vision, dental and health benefits. They offer life insrance, short term and long term disabilities. They are a good company to work for,but I do suggest that you make sure you I's are dotted and your t's are crossed and always have a paper trail.",4,Current Employee,Photo Specialist ,5323 E Court St North Burton Mi 48509,6/17/17,2017,6,17

Did Not Enjoy My Time Here,"The workplace was awful. Managers were rude, self-entitled and lacked basic communication skills.

Walmart is okay,"My typical work day at Walmart would have been very smooth. Starting the shift it would be slow through out the shift it would pick up. Most days i'd leave work feeling satisfied knowing my job performance was good. The hardest part of work for me would have been dealing with management. I didn't have too many issues personally with management, but I've witness things get crazy. There was definitely a lot of favoritism and fraternization displayed through many on the management team. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting very sweet customer compliments, and knowing you truly helped someone. People really overlook retail jobs, but theres so much good. The only thing i really learned, that i confidently can pass on and apply to the work force is, ""if you have a problem with favoritism, you must become the favorite.""",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service/Sales Associate ,"Oakwood, GA",6/16/17,2017,6,16

Great workplace and nice management,"A typical day for me was arrive at 4:00pm, clock in, head to the backroom and set up pallets on the floor before we started to unload the truck. My supervisor would instruct us on our duties for the trailer unloading, which includes entering the truck trailer and putting freight on a conveyer line, stacking pallets neatly with freight, or being a ""puller"" or somebody who pulls completely stacked pallets with a pallet jack. Hardest part was definitely being inside of the trailer putting the freight on the line. _x000D__x000D_Management was very nice and considerate, they occasionally brought back drinks for the receivers.

Productive work space,A day typical day at Walmart would be helping customers find what they need and jetting to the cash register when needed. What I learned at Walmart was how to work a cashier and show my remembrance of the store by leading customers to where they need to be rather than telling them which also improved me knowledge about items in the store. The hardest part of working at Walmart would have been restocking shelves due to customers but luckily practicing where items were in the store made the job easier.

Walmart is a great place to work.,Walmart is a great job while going to school or just for the daily grind. I definitely wouldn't consider it a career job but not a bad job for supplemental income while going to school (college) or even a great first job while still in high school. I personally wouldn't pursue this workplace for a career but if you have a passion for providing the public with inexpensive places to shop then the Walmart stores may be the right place for you and that's not a bad thing at all.

Morrow ga walmart,This job is the worse job I have ever worked at in my life.  they gave me unreachable goals. They blamed me for things that were not my fault not even a week from the day I started.  Stationary is unorganized and i was made to be the fall guy for the managers not doing their job. I asked them for a hardship transfer to get away from the negative work enviorment and to be close to where i stay and they would not give it to me and then wondered why i would be late making it to work the whole job was a joke if someone tells you that they need a job transfer so they can stay in the company and do their job to the best of their ability and you wont give it to them you are setting your employees up for failure and i was not about to continue to be their scapegoat.

Unhealthy work environment.,"Each day was very daunting towards the end of my employment here. Management was cruel and would place loads and loads of work onto one employee where as they would let another just waltz around and do whatever they liked. If assaulted an employee could not defend themselves, only run away. On top of that when my Uncle was sick and lost his battle to cancer I went to call out and they reacted very coldly.

Good work with decent people and good management.,"Both of the remodels I have participated in for Walmart were good jobs. Although the first remodel started off with bad management, the supervisor was replaced and things got back on track. With good management, the job was not very difficult, it paid well, and had great compensation for your time spent driving or working. As long as the supervisors are good then everyone will be doing their job, so you don't have to worry about picking up other people slack too much. You get split up into groups under different supervisors depending on your ability to preform certain tasks, from setting mods, to tearing down and rebuilding steel structures. The pay was good, the people were nice, and the job was fun. All in all a good work experience.",5,Former Employee,Remodel Crew ,"Wabash, IN",6/15/17,2017,6,15

Could've Been something great,While working at my store I met many great people and had a fun times & bad. Then I slowly started to realize only two of my three managers actually knew what they were doing and sadly the odd one out was usually on the clock during my shift. The whole group bumped heads with this said manager causing a very unstable work moral. But let me tell you the days that manager was off work was 50 times better. Leaving the store was a very hard thing to do but I was trying to finish up school at the time and it just didn't fit my schedule.,3,Former Employee,Shelf stocker and customer assistant ,"Tulsa, OK",6/15/17,2017,6,15
Easily known as corporate ran,The job is not as fun and well paying as the company would like you to think . Only management is promoted never regular sales floor associates. Equal opportunity does not exist within this job. Managers cannot be expected to assist regular associates unless it is of a benefit to them. Management often disrespects and undervalued it's associates. There is a never ending cycle of power within management due to the fact they never promote from the outside of management ranks ensuring only management salaries rise . So a manager that is already making 16 an hour may receive  a pay raise by transferring to another department instead of promoting a sales associate that is only making 9 dollars an hour . Management has no reguard for employees lives and expect employess to he at work everyday for little pay amd hard work in any condition of weather ..there is no rationalizing with management also because they refuse to hear any regular associate out,1,Former Employee,One Touch Associate ,"Socorro, NM",6/15/17,2017,6,15

Could use more moral in the work enviorment,I have worked with Wal-Mart for over 13 years. When I first started I think we had a great staff . It was a pleasant place to work and customers loved shopping there. As the years went by it seems that it was not the same place as when I started. I know things change and you have to adapt to it. But I think as a store level management forgot how to treat their employers with respect and expected more and more from them. I do like the company as a whole (benefits and salary are reasonable and they do give a lot to the community). I feel that the managers are under a lot of stress related from the job and they need to be retrained in customer service and to help out their associates more.,3,Current Employee,Customer service mgr ,"Epping, NH",6/15/17,2017,6,15

A good job for gaining a different understanding of how people see.,"From the time I clocked in, my job was fast paced, lots of customers, time management, trying to find the happy medium between measurements for glasses and walk in repairs and still learning different aspects of what was required of me for my understanding of how to help the constant flow of customer needs. I learned about different glass styles, how to measure in order for the patient to be able to see correctly, how to handle customers that felt like their needs were not being met. I worked with knowledgeable associates but the manager was not trained well and did not seem to be a very good fit for his title. The hardest part of the job was the interoffice politics and scheduling conflicts and not being trained well enough to be left alone after only one shift and not being able to help the customers thoroughly. I enjoyed helping the customers when I knew how. The customers that tried their new glasses on for the first time and their reaction to having better or clearer vision was a wonderful feeling for all of us.",4,Former Employee,Optician ,"Bend, OR",6/15/17,2017,6,15

Good Company to Work For,"The company is very good and has a lot available to employees as far as benefits and actually relatively reasonable ability to get days off-if you know 6 months in advance AND they like you. You start at $(/hour and are bumped up to $10 after a few months, which is nice in combination with their willingness to work every legally available second of your time. Also very good about making sure you take breaks and lunch times as long as they notice you are there. Management is deplorable due to a lack of communication and organization as well as a seeming lack of knowledge regarding the parts of a store they are supposed to be working for.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lake Worth, TX",6/15/17,2017,6,15
Great Working and Learning experience,"Working as a Pharmacy Technician, a typical day could include working with irate customers, refilling and filling doctor prescribed medications. Calling doctor offices to request a new prescription to be sent. Calling insurance companies inquiring about a billing errors. Calling customers to let them know their prescription is ready or if there was a problem completing their prescription order. I had to learn to work with individuals of different religious beliefs, culture, ethnicity and disabilities. The hardest part was when I was unable to help a customer with their needs, due to things out of my reach to control.

job security- no family life,"With Walmart being such a large corporation- job security is there as long as you work your job.  Promotions and climbing the ladder gives you ambition to keep pushing forward- but the higher you get into the company it becomes politics and not on whether you are deserving.  Hours are long and demanding taking you away from the family.  System scheduling leaves a lot of associates with no hours to make ends meat.

It was a great place to work,They worked around my school schedule and the employees was great! Everyone was really friendly and helpful. They had a really strict alcohol policy but that may have changed since I've stopped working there.

It is a very compettitve workplace,"On an overall I did enjoy working for Walmart. Dealing with customers in any job can both rewarding and challenging. The upside was that you had the chance to learn multiple areas, and growing your understanding and knowledge of each area in the store wasn't only encourage but recommended. However the down side to that was that management would then take advantage of it, and demand you do the work of a position that while you might know, would not be compensated for or even given the position for. In such a large store and retail chain day to day tasks were often made harder than necessary and the reason being a quote you heard often around the store. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. We were always understaffed, and members of management would go over notes and ask you to do a certain task one way. However that one way would change several times before it was finally done. by different members of management and sometimes even the same manager. all par for the course yes, but communication goes a long way. _x000D_I enjoyed the challenge and fast pace of day to day life at Walmart.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Hermitage, TN",6/15/17,2017,6,15
Bad Store,It's just not a place where you are treated as a person. It's more like a prison rather than a work place. In my experience I wouldn't work for this Store again.

Management uncooperative,"The managers didn't want to work with me. Even when I put I could only work 25 hours because I was a full time student they wouldn't work with me on the days I needed off. Also they would constantly pull all of apparel out to every other department and only leave the person at the dressing room there. I didn't have a problem with that but then they would yell at us for not having our department clean. On a typical work day I would be handling the jewelry counter or sales floor, organizing stock or tables and racks so they looked up to par. The hardest part of the job was constantly redoing what was just fixed because a store is always busy. It could look perfect and you ask a manager to come look for approval, and by the time they get there it is messy again and it looks bad on you. But you can't tell people not to mess it up because they are customers.

Unorganized environment where associates are not treated fairly,"Management does not resolve employee issues.  Problems are shoved under the rug and ignored.  There is no foundation for communication, and not much respect for those who work hard. No consequences for employees, especially managers, who do nothing and pass off their responsibilities on to others.  There is especially  no consequences for managers who constantly disrespect their employees and make them feel unappreciated.  The pay is not fair for the amount of work that is expected and especially given the amount of money that Wal-Mart is worth! Some departments are paid more than others for doing less work.  That makes absolutely no sense.  While I am grateful for having a paid job, by no means would I ever recommend this as a place to work.  Perhaps in the mid-west where people are just overall friendlier, but not in Southern California.  Most of the employees are lazy and rewarded for such behavior, while those who deserve praise get left behind, and the customers are needy and cranky and have a false sense of entitlement.",2,Current Employee,Lawn and Garden Team Member ,"Simi Valley, CA",6/14/17,2017,6,14

Courtesy Associate = Cart Pusher = No Advancement,"Typical day through all hours is to push carts from the islands outside and get them back into the store for customers to use. Occasionally helped with product going in and coming out of the store for customers and always greet people as walking by. Learned how much hard work it is for menial tasks. Management was ok, stiff and hard to get compliments out of but most of the time firm and fair. Workplace culture ok, a few good people and some of the more delinquents would be put as courtesy associate. Hardest part of the job is first few months getting adjusted to the work if not a normal part of working out and staying hydrated when needed. Enjoyable part is getting to rest and only wash windows when all of the carts were collected and able to get some sort of breather in between.",3,Former Employee,Part- time Courtesy Associate ,"Charlotte, NC 28216",6/14/17,2017,6,14

"Work hard and do your best, but be prepared to make your efforts and ambition known to management.","It takes initiative and motivation to move up at Walmart. In my experience, you cannot rely on your managers to be paragons of excellence who meter out advancement and promotions to whom it is due.

Standard work,"Now this is back from 2014 when I did work at walmart. For the most part it was a straight forward job, especially at night, all we had to do was stock, and straighten and then go home.

Good for a first job...,"I started at one Walmart and transferred to another. Completely different work environments. No matter where you're at it has a fast paced environment and always something to do. This is if you do your job well. Otherwise you can slack off, stand around, and management wont do anything. One location was very easy going and the managers stuck in their positions, the other location had managers that jumped around departments. It's really hard to keep track of who you need to talk to sometimes._x000D_I honestly cared about my job but management does pick favorites and those are the ones that advance. Took me over 2 years to advance, but I appreciated the opportunity.

Great Co-Workers,"A typical day at work is overseeing the cashiers, running the customer service/money center, assisting customers, doing register audits, hopping on a register if there were lines, doing register audits, help train cashiers, push carts, empty and reset registers and self checks, and whatever tasks management assigned to me to be done.  The hardest part of the job was being required to do all of the above mentioned things while being short staffed.  Scheduling has become inconsistent, thereby I never have a set schedule or have set days off anymore.  Even after discussing this with the manager who does the scheduling and having them promise they would fix it, it is still inconsistent.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Saint Peters, MO",6/14/17,2017,6,14

It all depends on who you work for.,"At my first store in Moore, Oklahoma, my peers and managers became friends and family. They were kind, insightful, and helpful. They cared about each other, even new hires. They made sure everyone was comfortable and knew that they had someone to talk to if they needed someone. It was such a homely experience to work there that even after I moved, I would stop in when I was in town and give them a rundown of my life. _x000D_However when I moved to a new store in Lawton, Oklahoma, I was  treated as if I didn't belong. I was called out on rules I knew I was following, I was singled out and verbally attacked by each and every manager. When I told management I was being physically harassed by a customer, I was laughed at and mocked. I think the happiness and comfort ability in a work place depend on who you work with and where you are stationed.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Moore, OK",6/14/17,2017,6,14
stressful and unfair workplace,"At our Walmart in Pearsall there is a lot of favoritism and unfair working environment. The management we have are very bad and don't care about what matters. As soon as one of the high school kids cry about one little thing they give them what they want but if a veteran has a problem they get told it's not their problem. I have learned a lot working at Walmart and the biggest lesson  they taught me was if you cry and complain enough you'll get what you want but,  that is not the way I want to work I love working hard and that doesn't seem to matter to the management at Walmart store #478. When I informed my head manager I was looking for other employment I was told to hope my new jobs don't call them as a reference because he wouldn't speak to them. So for anyone thinking of going to Walmart I suggest thinking it over unless you want to deal with bad management, carelessness and favoritism.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Pearsall, TX",6/14/17,2017,6,14

Walmart Review,I absolutely loved working at Walmart. I enjoyed meeting all kinds of new people and I enjoyed the company of my managers and fellow employees.

Productive,I would get the at 10'oclock to clock in then we would all meet to know where we would be stocking. Most of the time we would have a lot to stock because everyone shops at Walmart. Sometimes whenever I finished early I would go back to the receiver area where I would help unload new shipments off the truck. It was fun meeting new people and mingling with customers,2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Brenham, TX",6/14/17,2017,6,14
Unfair management,I know people who have worked at different walmarts across NC and pretty much all of them quit their job due to unfair management.

Not what you would expect,Working here is down right a joke there is a point system after so many points you get fired. For example if your child gets sick and is in the hospital you get points each day you are out and it can cost you your job. Now it wasn't always like this it was at one time a great place to work and I can even understand the point system to a degree because there are people that call out just to call out but when there is a doctors note envolved then said points should be used,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Aberdeen, NC",6/14/17,2017,6,14
not worth it,Walmart was a job for me while I was in high school. they hired me knowing I was a high school student and still expected me to come in at 2:30 while I was still in school.

Sr. Management does not care about work/home balance. Meetings are scheduled at the last minute and you have to come in an extra day when you don't make your goal, (which is every week because training is not an excuse to not make goal) so you can't even make plans on your ""days off"".

Challenging,"My time with Walmart was rough, to say the least. When I started I was promised to have Sundays blocked from my schedule, as well as promised a guaranteed time blocked out of my schedule for a wedding I was to attend... SEVERAL MONTHS OUT. In both instances I had to fight for what I was promised in the very beginning, and after I was finally hired and I was assigned to my department, in both cases I was treated differently by management after my case was won ( with Physical Proof!). I was continually told no when I asked to work on my learn Modules (of which I was shown in the handbook that they CANNOT tell you you can't work on them unless there is a situation.) so I could could eventually move up the rung. Sad enough, my problems didn't end when I quit. This year when I went to file my taxes I found out that Walmart DID NOT withhold all the money for federal taxes from my check, so I got hit with that after I did my taxes. Listen, I have great appreciation for the time I work for and was provided for by Walmart, but this was one of the most difficult jobs I've ever had to work for not because of the work, but the company and the management it's-self.",2,Former Employee,Cap 1 Associate ,"Woodland Park, CO",6/12/17,2017,6,12

Welcoming work place with a great enviroment.,"The workplace was very energetic and comfortable. I learned the importance of customer service.

"Alright Job, is what it is","CAP Team two member: Arrive at work at 2p.m. help setup general merchandise warehouse for unloading of trucks. Required moving of pallets and carts into set places. A short meeting to inform everyone of what was happening, how many trucks we had to unload and who would be sent where, meeting also involved stretches. Half the team would be sent to sales floor to stock aisles while the other half remained in the back to unload trucks. CAP Team 2 only does dry grocery, pets and HBA. (shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, etc) For the first hour to two hours your task while on the sales floor is to straighten the risers, meaning you get a ladder cart and straighten top stock. This involved moving what items could fit to the appropriate place on the shelves and ""left justifying"" everything you couldn't. After this is complete or your time is up you go back to the grocery warehouse and take stock back to the floor to stock shelves. Floor is full of customers so this can be a bit hectic. Goals for this are unrealistic as they plan out how long it should take you, 1 minute per box. In that time you are expected to find item slot, stock item while pulling all older items forward and removing damaged/expired product. All the while helping and greeting customers and of course waiting for them to shop the area you are working. Your time does not stop when going back to retrieve more stock or throwing away trash. After stocking what you can you must place ""topstock"" items on risers and take whatever you cannot fit up there to the back and ""bin"" it. Once you complete your task you task out and - more...",2,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Pekin, IL",6/12/17,2017,6,12
Productive fun place to work fast environment,This job taught me a lot about customer service and helped me feel more comfortable with speaking to customers.

Not a work environment for me,I find that the workplace culture is unfriendly.  Employees generally do not provide good customer service.  New expectations are not shared with all employees which becomes very frustrating and confusing for all.  Many hours are spent on outdated training materials that should be spent on some customer service training techniques.,1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Sedalia, MO",6/12/17,2017,6,12

Loved interacting with customers and helping them out however I could.,"At the Service Desk, you did anything from sending money to other people in the U.S. or other countries, to returning merchandise that is not right for the customer or was defective. Sometimes we would ring up the customers orders of merchandise that they got in the store, to help out the cashiers on the floor. We would help security out on a daily basis, based on activity and stolen items being returned. We would have to keep a good pace up, because sometimes you are all alone up there with a long line of customers waiting on you. Hardest part was that prior sentence. Being all alone with a lot of customers was crazy. Hopefully management would come help out or send someone, sometimes not. Loved meeting new people and helping them out anyway that i could.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate and Cashier ,"Kirksville, MO",6/11/17,2017,6,11
Easy and work at your own pace,I was a vendor for Walmart I worked in the Hallmark Greetings cards. I came in signed in with a hand held machine they give you and go to the back of walmart where the stock is and bring everything up front that needs to be replaced or replenished. Its gets really easy if you stay on top of things and its always disorganized and you will always have something to do.  It was ok pay but not enough hours it was only part time and never got any more hours for working there. Never received a pay raise even for traveling to other stores to help out. You are your own boss pretty much and don't have someone looking over your shoulder the whole time. You just come in and do what needs to be done then leave.,3,Former Employee,Hallmark Greeting Cards ,"Norman, OK",6/11/17,2017,6,11

Understaffed and Overworked,"The company recently went through a change where they did raise their minimum wage above the normal 7.35. But to get around the profit loss they have been cutting hours for almost all of the associates, excluding management, and have also been hiring less people and expecting more out of the other associates to pick up the slack. If you work your way up to salary management and you don't mind not having a personal life it is the job for you, but if you only want to be an associate or a hourly supervisor DON'T DO IT.",2,Current Employee,Anonymous ,"Conroe, TX",6/11/17,2017,6,11
Horrible Management and lack of care for the employees,Throughout the day cashiers ring up the items of the customers and bag them while trying to provide great customer service. I have learned how to deal with people and their many types of attitudes. The management team was horrible and could care less about their employees. They thrived on giving workers minimal hours in order to receive a greater bonus check. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude people all day. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people.,3,Former Employee,"Cashier, Money Center ","Bourbonnais, IL",6/11/17,2017,6,11
Great Place to Work,Working at the distribution center has been a great experience for me since leaving the military. I have learned quite a bit from my civilian associates. The one thing I can say needs attention is the management Walmart has running their warehouse. Management as a whole needs help. They have a lot of first time managers who don't know how to manage people. None of them know how to do the job they are over so going to them for help is nearly impossible. There were times I had to find out answers to my work related questions by myself. Being in the military gave me the training to figure out my own matters but that's what your managers are there for. The job is easy compared to what I did for 24 years but the most enjoyable part of my job is the people I interact with on a daily basis.,4,Former Employee,T3 Trainer/Seasonal Lead ,"Atlanta, GA",6/11/17,2017,6,11

Walmart was my first real job,"I worked at Walmart in my Senior year of high school. The managers did not work with my high school schedule at all and would often schedule me at least 32 hours per week. At the time I was taking college classes at Collin County and several AP classes and it was hard to keep up. If I had potential hours I was working. I had no time to study. Also, Walmart is fast-paced, there are a lot of customers always and the manager would yell if the parking lot wasn't clean, if you had gone on the other side than they assigned or if you let the side you were not assigned to build up. There was no winning. The pay was good for what it was, $8 an hour, but due to the management and the bureaucracy of Wal-Mart I would not recommend the company and I never tried to go back",2,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Frisco, TX",6/11/17,2017,6,11

"Walmart Distribution Alachua, FL","Walmart, overall, is a good company, however, the Distribution Center often goes through employees and management quickly.  If you work afternoon or weekend shifts, you will not get any hours above 30-35 per week.  The pay is great, but if you drive more than 25 miles one way to get there, it's not worth it.  They often send you home right after you get to work because there isn't enough work.  The management team, some of them, are great, however, others are horrible.  They spread false rumors about employees, write you up for every little thing and are quick to send you home.  You don't make enough in your paychecks to pay for insurance, much less contribute to 401k.",3,Current Employee,Order Puller/Forklift Driver ,"Alachua, FL",6/11/17,2017,6,11
Long-Hours and decent wages,"Company does not have a lot of cashiers in which I applied for, so they give you long grueling hours that's close to full-time employment.

Politics will dictate your career.,"The first 8 years were amazing in terms of personal and career growth.  Compensation for the long hours and sacrifices of family are the best in the business.  I really enjoyed my assignments to the point of calling it ""fun.""  The last three years were not as enjoyable.  It felt like there was an agenda to push out all managers, regardless of performance, that did not fit a specific profile.  Very sad to see some of the best managers I've ever had the privilege of working with pushed out of the company.",3,Former Employee,Supercenter Store Manager ,"Cincinnati, OH",6/10/17,2017,6,10
Difficult to Work Around,"Boring work, but not too bad - certainly not difficult.  Most inconvenient aspect about working at Walmart is the lack of stable work schedule.  If you're not interested in talking to your co-workers or interacting with them, then the cashier position will probably suit you well.  The break-room was quite large and nice, sometimes snacks were provided.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Hagerstown, MD",6/10/17,2017,6,10

Only a Stepping Stone,"I would have to say it's the second worst job I have ever had. Management doesn't listen to you. They never tell you when you do a good job, even if it's WAY beyond standards. The only time they want to talk to you is to tell you when you have done something wrong, any other time they are busy and will ""be right there"" or tell you to catch them a bit later.",2,Former Employee,Jewelry Associate ,"Hibbing, MN",6/10/17,2017,6,10
Walmart Asset Protection,Walmart's Asset Protection Associate job is one of the best with the company but the job security is really low.

"walmart is a great place to work, altho my store was an exception","Switching store managers after only 1 year of being open really affected the store management team. most of the management team wasnt qualified to run as store and were doing it all for the wrong reasons.

Great work environment and great people,Working at Walmart was a great experience for me as a first job! Always kept my hands full and the people their were easy to work with! The work wasn't too bad most nights but it could be a lot at times. Management acted as if they were associates which made it seem like everyone was equal. I think the hardest  part about working at Walmart was adjusting to over nights but other then that it wasn't too bad.,5,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Melbourne, FL",6/10/17,2017,6,10
Co-workers are great,"Although the management can sometimes play favorites, the teamwork that the regular employees provides makes it worth it.

The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management team.",3,Former Employee,CAP 2 supervisor ,"Lebanon, MO",6/10/17,2017,6,10
productive workplace with many opportunities for growth,coming in to work is like a safe zone. its a opportunity to constantly learn new things and interact and socialize with all kinds of people. management is very encouraging and understanding. they are always willing to show you new things and talk about how to move up or help show you ways to further your skills and schooling. the hardest part of the job is being understaffed which doubles the work load making it hard to provide great customer service. the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with people and meeting lots of new and different people.,5,Current Employee,customer service manager ,"Sheridan, AR",6/10/17,2017,6,10

Management was hard to work with.,"The management of the store was hard to work with, Inconsiderate, gave work orders that were clashing with what other managers wanted you to do. Were not very coordinated with each other. They did give you time off when requested. (3 weeks ahead of time) They would make time to talk to you if you had any issues with anything. Sadly the schedules were not set since it is retail. If you are looking for somewhere to work while in school, training, or anything that requires a lot of other time, Then this job should work fine for you.",4,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Aberdeen, WA",6/10/17,2017,6,10

Great job for students.,"I know everyone harps on Walmart, but its a good place for students.

It's an alright place to work,"They have plenty of opportunities for advancement, and they do offer great benefits after you've been there long enough. Making it long enough can be difficult though, the schedule they give you can make it extremely hard to stay healthy, closing one night, then opening the next morning, leaving you incredibly tired and your immune system down. They might have you scheduled to leave at 10 one night, but don't expect to be clocking out until midnight on those nights. But the benefits are fantastic, and they offer more breaks than anywhere I've heard of.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Muskegon, MI",6/10/17,2017,6,10

Negative experience with a few staff members.,"Management changed three times over a few months, making it difficult for associates to adjust to different manager style. The workplace culture became very stressful and intimidating, in my observation. No breaks and constant reminders from management that you ""could be fired"" for various actions. I saw two other associates have panic attacks during work, as a result of workplace stress.  Extremely nonprofessional and critical behavior towards myself occurred without a proper response. I learned not to put up with this kind of treatment from employers or managers ever again. When someone cannot control their actions or words then just leave the job. They don't care if you're in an inferior position.",1,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Abilene, TX",6/10/17,2017,6,10
Always kept busy,The bosses always made sure we weren't overtaxed but never bored either. I learned where every item in the store was located. The people I worked with were very helpful.

Positive Professional Work Enviroment,"Walmart was very organized an took care of their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job would be when i was in the electronics department working with customers. The hardest part of the job would have definitely been the overnights that i worked when the needed extra hands to set up for sales, seasonal products, and stocking. Management was extremely understanding and managed their departments without micro-managing. I learned at Wal-Mart that if you ave work ethic and have passion for the job you have you can move up to better things. Working at Wal-Mart is a great way to make a decent amount of money to be able support yourself while trying to better yourself, such as, going to school, paying debits, getting experience, etc......

Walmart,Walmart is one of the worst places I think you can ever work at they were so unprofessional on so many levels I got fire for breve meant it was so unfair if I'll like they had set me up they told me it was fine.  Just to bring back proof and I did and when I did they fired me they treat their employees really bad and don't appreciate your work you get to be a permanent brain depending on who you know and how much but kissing you do and I think when people that really deserve those management positions were not really given the opportunity because of the unfairness that happens in this company,1,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Southgate, CA",6/10/17,2017,6,10

"Nice environment, but not properly staffed.","Walmart can be a great store, but with new changes it has become harder to enjoy your work. Staffing is a constant issue.

Depends on your management.,"Over the last almost seven years I have worked for the company I have never felt more degraded and used as I have working there. A typical work day consists of doing your job and being criticized doing as you are told too, as well as catching attitude and being blamed for the mistakes of your co-workers. I have learned from this job many good things as far as customer service, to do as corporate requires as well as my job title but doing more will not get you anywhere. I would not recommend working for Wal-Mart to anyone as a long term goal. No matter how hard you work, how much you put into the job, how much you change your family and personal life you are expendable and not going to move anywhere unless you kiss up to management. Which is something I’ll never do. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out which day was going to be a good and productive day and which one you were going to get yelled at for someone else because they said you did something you didn’t do. Even when the camera’s proved it wasn’t you. They are not accommodating to you home life as well. You have to be there when they say. If you need a day off there is never a guarantee you’re going to get it. They deny and approve as they see fit even when it’s an important doctors appointment.

Management would make you stay past your clock out time and then make you clock in late the following day, so no one could receive overtime. They would task you over eight hours of freight, when you only have 5.5 hours to actually work it. They would fire associates and not replace them in a timely manner so that when you asked for a day or two off you were denied because of no coverage.

Fast-paced active environment,"I love my job in the bakery. Because of the lack of staffing, I get to enjoy all aspects of the job. I have enjoyed working, learning, filling in for the various roles- donuts, cakes, bread and rolls, freight, inventory. I enjoy the challenge of learning to be as efficient as possible. The aspects I most enjoy are when I am an extra person and I get to help my coworkers complete their tasks. Cake decorating is my absolute favorite, and I wish I could have more opportunity to do so.",3,Current Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Gardner, KS",6/9/17,2017,6,9

"Fine, Except for the supervisor","I had a supervisor that would tell me to go to lunch and come right back, after I came back she'd tell me I forgot to do something that she never told me to do. It was terrible. I didn't quit because of her, but to be completely honest, if I wasn't moving I probably would've eventually quit because of her.",4,Former Employee,Night Time Cashier ,"Yelm, WA",6/9/17,2017,6,9

Potential for advancement severly lacking,"Little respect for efforts of workers is shown. Massive turnover is common. Earned vacation is very difficult to obtain. Schedule is erratic, usually reduction of time. Can't get insurance through company because of lack of hours (time required). Emphasis on safety is a plus for all concerned. A discount card is issued after required period of employment. Job is not difficult to perform, there is plenty to do in order to stay busy.",2,Current Employee,Maintenance Worker ,"Jackson, OH",6/9/17,2017,6,9
poor management,"I worked with walmart for approximately 3years. Management is horrible. They will not work with you on your availability and if you need to change it they threaten you by saying your hours may get cut back.They push you even if you are the only one working in your department. They give you false hope of getting help in your department. Whenever the ""big guys"" visit the store they decide to pretend to care about you and your department.

Trust and cooperation with useful benefits,At Wal-Mart I felt like while I would have to deal with some rowdy customers at times or some difficult cleaning situations that we were a team regardless of time of day and a task that may have been meant for one would become the task of many if needed depending on the business of the day and the experience of the employee. For example I would sometimes help less experienced employees or overworked employees if needed and it helped me keep focused on the team and not myself.,3,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Lafayette, CO",6/9/17,2017,6,9
Experience varies depending on location,"This particular experience left me feeling indifferent. While I had 5 years of experience that they were more than willing to take advantage of, company policy would not allow them to compensate me accordingly. This left me a little resentful, but the people I worked directly with were good people. I will honestly say I preferred my previous location over this one when it came to how things were done. The hardest part, the low pay and part time hours. The best part, good co-workers.. at least in my experience.",3,Former Employee,Mod Team ,"Chelan, WA",6/9/17,2017,6,9

Stressful and poor morale,"Have been given many chances to try different positions-consider myself lucky because I have been promoted and able to move. The management at store level is concerned about the people who work there but that is where the concern ends.

If someone wants to be promoted, grow a thick skin.",3,Current Employee,Training Coordinator ,"LaPorte, IN",6/8/17,2017,6,8
not a fair company if you are a woman of color,consist of making sure the cashiers have money at all times opening and closing the store management was not very supportive they mostly stayed in the office culture was not good everybody was tired and over worked trying to get management to listen to complaints and concerns associates who really cared about,2,Former Employee,customer service mgr/ cashier ,"Vacaville, CA",6/8/17,2017,6,8

Horrible Management,"You can be a hard worker and management will still find ways to set you up for failure and human resources turns a blind eye whenever confronted. For example, I was taken out of my own department to help a department I never worked in, and then was written up for ""lack of work"" when it was just a lack of knowledge of how to do the job being asked.",2,Former Employee,Produce Clerk ,"Madison, AL",6/8/17,2017,6,8

Managers are the biggest problems,"The work is the most physically demanding within the store and the least compensated. My co-workers are amazing and its great working with them. The assistant managers will hound you throughout the day about the speed you are completing your tasks with your team, but the blame lies on them because it's hard to do a job that requires 8 people with only 4.

The managers were horrible and seemed to have their favorites as to whom got to do what. Whenever I asked for help I would get the side eye sometimes and it made me uncomfortable.

Most Enjoyable,"I enjoyed having this job.  I worked with a great group of people and we worked well together.  My favorite part about this job was that Walmart recognized the skill set I have been taught by the military as a pharmacy technician, and they compensated me appropriately as well as gave an environment conducive to continue to build upon my skill set.  Being a pharmacy technician is often discredited because the pharmacist has the final check, and their name is the one on the bottle.  Walmart did not make me feel any less for that, in fact they gave credit where it was due and recognized the amount of work a technician does to ensure that what the pharmacist hands to the patient has been done to perfection.",4,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"San Antonio, TX",6/6/17,2017,6,6

"Good pay with good benifiets, Just very unpredictable.","Walmart has tons of opportunities to advance your career if you are willing to put in the time and effort.  There will be a lot of holidays and weekends worked.  It is retail, so that's a given.  Minimal staffing can make a workday a nightmare with call outs.

"fun, fast-paced, something new everyday","stocking, price changes, inventory auditing, setting up displays and plenty of customer service. Management has been known to be very demanding and sometimes your best is just never good enough. The hardest part about being a department manager is coming in at least 4 of my 5 days a week at 630 am and seeing many of the third shift associates goofing off rather than stocking the 20 to 30 pallets of freight left over from the previous nights truck. Third shift never seems to be held accountable for their constant lack of productivity.",4,Current Employee,Department Manger ,"Hanson, KY",6/6/17,2017,6,6

Didn't feel apreciated,"A typical day at work was either boring or unfulfilled.

Management could have done better and hired more, or informed us that we could take a break when it was needed. Workplace culture was about what you could expect for Walmart in a small town like this.

My personal revew of walmart below,A typical day starts with restocking shelves you may need 3 items of one thing and 8 of anotherspend alot of time in the freezer collecting these items tag use by stickers.I frosted and decorated cakes of frgerated shelves. I took orders for cakes and decorated them per customers request sometimes 10 a day. There was alot of cleanup at end of day. In my opiinion the management and associates over worked most days due to not enough help  the hardest part was trying to get all job duties finished  and I'm  a pretty fast worker. The most enjoyable  part of the job was pleases the customers.I worked in 3 different departments day and night shift worked with a lot of nice people some not so nice some hard workers some lazy. For the most part Wal-mart  treated me good.you would have your difficult  customers also especially  about cakes not being perfect .I worked in meat department for about a year and I really enjoyed working there with some good people hard workers like myself..the only thing my hours would change alot one day I worked 7-4 and the next 1-10 then next 7-4 again I mostly kept theshelves stocked and customer service.

Management is the worst,"At store 1357, overnight managers expect way too much. While you work your a** off, they walk around and criticize your work, make you redo everything you already did, then go do someone else's job, and then coach you that way you can never get a management position. I would rather have re-enlisted in the Marine Corps should I had known how bad it was, and Marine life sucks too. Come to think about it, this Walmart works like a corrupt command.

It is a fun place to work but very challenging,Working at walmart can be very challenging at first because if you haven't ever dealt with so many people at once you could get confused quickly.

Customers are better than managers,"My experience at Walmart was horrible. In the beginning, they try to make it sound like the experience will be nice and easy paced, but give them two or three weeks and you'll see how things change. After the month of working with them, I was being harassed at work by CSM, which is a supervisor, and managers didn't care about the situation. Not to mention they carry the work environment like a military base. You cannot talk to your coworkers while at work or multitasking, managers make the rules as they go, and basically blame their associates for doing things they aren't supposed to do even though associates ask them first hand. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.",2,Former Employee,ASSOCIATE ,"Tampa, FL",6/5/17,2017,6,5
High action and high stress job with good and bad aspects.,"Wal-mart was a highly educational experience, teaching the challenges and triumphs of daily work within retail. Members of management (see most, not all) were curt and apt to bouts of attitude, which is understandable considering the context of retail and the negativity of dissatisfied consumer complaints. Yet I say this as well: that should never affect your interaction with co workers or underlings. Beyond that it was an enjoyable struggle to ensure that even the worst customer left with a smile on their face.",3,Former Employee,Retail/Customer Service ,"Federal Way, WA",6/5/17,2017,6,5

I understand that it's hard to make a schedule that works for everyone, but there was some serious favoritism that was shown when the managers there worked with the repeatedly changed schedule of one associate and not another, was willing to look over absences of one associate that had no note, just a verbal explanation, and not another who had notes explaining their absences was due to their sick children.

This is your basic retail job,This employer requires most employees to have open availablity and your schedule is more than likely going to be all over the board.  This company will require you to work holidays and can potentially schedule you outside of your availability even as a part time employee with limited availability.  Many frontline leadership positions are held by unqualified candidates and are less than helpful.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service/Department Manager ,"Beloit, WI",6/5/17,2017,6,5

It depends,"I worked at Jet.com loyally and faithfully. I remember one day I worked so hard I collapsed. I was not praised for my hard work, my lack of complaining. It became harder when newer people got hired and they started complaining. Pretty soon the music selection went from diverse to just plain pop and rap (and maybe an occasional terrible punk rock song)....pretty soon it all became annoying. I ended up leaving because of all of the drama I let myself get into. I applied again recently for a management position in Nevada...they said they would call and even set a time and date for the call...I never was called. I did not even receive an apology for the potential phone interview...",2,Former Employee,Fullfillment Associate ,"Swedesboro, NJ",6/5/17,2017,6,5

Need Improvement,I feel the individual stores should have more control over their staff and policies based on the store location and the people. Walmart prides itself on family but when it comes to their employees they don't care. If you miss so many days they fire you no matter if your a good employee or not. Then rehire them in 30 days and not only do they start from scratch they have to go through the same training over again. That is a complete waste of money.  If you want a set schedule then Walmart is it if you need a flexible one just don't bother to apply.,2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Charleston, WV",6/5/17,2017,6,5
Ok,"Needs more workers, more training is needed in this facility..there are no options to move up in this facility. You don't get paid vacations...The managers don't help out at all they just stand there all night.not good...",3,Current Employee,Forklift Operator ,"Albany, NY",6/5/17,2017,6,5

Constantly want to make your job harder,"At the pharmacy level it felt like corporate always had goals that included ways to make your job harder to do without your input.  They pushed ""model pharmacy"" on you and concerned themselves with how your workplace looks behind the counter, which often meant moving something you need for work every day all the way across the pharmacy from where you need it and threatening to write you up if it wasn't found in that location.  They wanted to push immunizations and required each store to hit an immunization goal, but it wasn't for public health and instead for the profit margins. They do prioritize the immunizations that they make more money on.  They will make promises and never come through with them.  At the store level there was a lack of respect and communication. It often feels as though management looks down on the pharmacy for one reason or another: workers at other stores seem to echo this._x000D_When asking for things they never got done in a timely manner. We contacted our store management to fix the heating and cooling system since it was always on full heat and that couldn't be changed, it made for a very uncomfortable work environment. This remained unchanged for months.  Almost the whole 5 years i worked there we had barely functioning equipment, making everyday much more difficult than it needed to be.",2,Former Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Morris, IL",6/4/17,2017,6,4
My take on Walmart,"A typical day at Walmart, as soon as we would get there we would start unloading the trucks. Some days there was two trucks, but most days there was only one. I learned how to drive a forklift and other machines.  Management in my opinion was awesome for the most part. Workplace culture was awesome too, I met some friends that I will have for a life time. The hardest part of the job was during Christmas time because there was so much freight, but nothing that I couldn't handle. The most enjoyable part of the job was we would get quarterly bonus checks.",4,Former Employee,Sales and Merchandising ,"Searcy, AR",6/4/17,2017,6,4

I was an unloader so I was in the backroom most of the day, and on those hot summer days we would ask for something as simple as a fan or even some cold bottled water and it was usually a problem.",3,Former Employee,IMS Associate ,"Goose Creek, SC",6/4/17,2017,6,4
I decorated cakes most of the day.,"I would take cake orders and decorate cakes.

A job to pay the bills,This jobs is not an ideal job but will pay the bills. The management is ok but communication is horrible. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet all day long.

Stressful and a hard place to work.,I would get with the immediate manager regarding the size of my truck and the employees I had to unload the truck. My employees were great until management felt they were not unloading the trucks fast enough. Management would ride them hard advising they could not take breaks or lunches until the truck was finished. The job was so stressful I stepped down to manage a different department.,1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Irving, TX",6/4/17,2017,6,4

Great place,"Management at Walmart is amazing depending on what one you go to. I loved my job there wish I could have stayed but sadly could not.

Unorganized with a lot of favoritism,"Wal-mart is not a great place to work in Oxford, MS. Management does not want to help associates and they show favoritism horribly. It is not worth what they claim benefits you. The store manager is rude, and people only tolerate him because he is the store manager. He makes you feel lower than dirt by the way he commands you to do things. Assistant Managers do no know how to talk to their associates either. Co managers are just as worse. When you become something like a Customer Service Manager, Dept Manager, Support Manager, or anything under Assistant Manager be prepared to be talked to like an animal just at this location. I used to love my job, until the store manager changed. Now this store is like a zoo. You can get a coaching for one thing and even if someone else does the same thing you've done with no penalty they still try to justify why you got coached. This store was so much better when the other store manager was there. They will overwork you with no raise. If you are a cashier, you'll be placed as a people greeter, stocker, cart pusher, etc. It doesn't matter. If management needs you regardless of how important it is for you to do your position they will still pull you. They do petty things that are uncalled for. Overnight management is not any better. I would not recommend anyone to work here. People get hired so much that remembering names is becoming difficult.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Oxford, MS",6/4/17,2017,6,4

No Support from management,"Long hours are easy to achieve, but it is almost impossible to get a full-time position. Pay is good, but really is not worth the workload.

"I actually enjoyed my time at Walmart, but.......","I really enjoyed working at Walmart. The work is not hard, back breaking work. It can be really fast paced, especially around holidays or sales like Black Friday and Back to School. They have a good benefits package for full time associates. However, they don't take good care of and at times take advantage their hourly associates. A couple years back Walmart said they were giving hourly associates though out the company a $0.50 an hour increase so their wages would be competitive in the market.The night I was called to the office to sign for and officially receive it I got the increase then my manager explained how Walmart was paying an overnight differential of $1 (like I was getting) in some stores and $.50 in the others and the were changing it so the differential at all stores was the same. Then he said they were reducing our overnight differential to $.50 then he said ""you didn't really lose anything"" . And so all of the unfortunate people working 3rd shift in a store that had been giving a $1 differential did not get that $.50 increase .All the fortunate associates working 1st and 2nd shifts and 3rd shift (in stores already getting a $.50 differential) received their increase. Also in 2017 they did away giving out increases with your annual review which was based on performance reflected in your review (between $.20 and $.60 per hr.). Instead all hourly associates got $.20 regardless.Otherwise I had fun. The work is easy. Most of the people are easy going. And besides that......you never know what is going to walk into Walmart.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance Associate ,"Mesa, AZ",6/3/17,2017,6,3
They changed the rules alot,I didnt mind the job itself. I was a cashier and liked how we had goals to reach.

management,"Walmart is a great job most of the time and you must be able to separate home life from professional life.

Management walked all over me and i felt like a little ant being crushed because those in management felt it was okay to harass those who were new.

Incentives of the same nature add to that as well, with friendly competitions between the various departments. The pay also stands out as being above average in the industry, you can tell the company has invested in its employee base down to the lowest level.

The company also has some great community involvement projects, like  fundraisers with motorcycle rides and gift making for the CMN (Child Miracle Network)._x000D_The company expects the employee to be very aware of his or her environment, pay attention to potentially unsafe conditions, and to use their equipment in the safe, prescribed manner._x000D_The only downside I see to working there is that the nature of the work is subject to severe seasonal variation, as the demand of the stores for apparel and shoes can wildly vary throughout the year.

It was alright,"Working in the Clinton, MD Walmart was exactly how I imagined it would be. You get freight, you stock, and you clean up. I had the pleasure of working overnight at a store that closed at night so there were a few hours where it was easier to work. The only downfall was the way the managers were. They expected you to read there minds. They would suggest for you to do something one way and after you have done it you are being told by the same manager to do it a completely different way. Also if you didn't work at super human speeds then you just simply ""weren't doing your job"". I didn't mind the work one bit.

I personally would not recommend working at walmart full time unless you are in desperate need or need a few extra cash on the side. The time goes by super slow as well.

Insane and ridiculous,"I won't complaint about the workload or the tasks assigned but overall, the management at Walmart is not efficient at all. Adjusting hours is almost impossible therefore, it becomes impossible to continue working especially for college students. The managers are not cooperative at all, everything is super-complicated, there is a high amount of stress at work, and one does not get paid according to the work they take from a person. I don't know about other positions, but working as a front-end cashier was a nightmare for me. Many of my co-workers were very cooperative and friendly and I wanted to continue working as I really need a job to survive. However, I tried my best and I requested the manager to change my schedule as I worked late till night in summer. I live far, I had to walk an hour to get there as there wasn't any public transportation that could take me there so it was hard for me to manage.

A great place to work,"Walmart for the most part is a great place to work. A lot of systems are in place to treat the hourly associates as fairly as possible. Management is a different story. I think Walmart is trying to replace the older management with new younger people. They have changed the schedules so they are harder for older management. They raised the starting rate for management, giving raises to the newer hires and managers who have been there the longest received no raise. I was capped out for four years and after the new salary structure, my pay was that of a just under mid range paid manager, even though I've been a manager for eighteen years.",4,Former Employee,Assistant manager ,"State College, PA,  then Ebensburg, Pa",6/2/17,2017,6,2
WalMart,"A typical day at Wal*Mart was fast paced, stocking isles by the counter, running cash register, helping customers, and zoning your area.

The work place wasn't anything like I thought, lots of rude individuals, weren't nice about sick days, complained when help was needed.

Inventory Worker,"I was responsible for keeping inventory in the back of the store and for stocking merchandise on the sales floor. While this is low to moderate labor, I did not necessarily feel any pressure from team members or my managers and supervisors. Rather, I felt encouraged to contribute more to the team's agenda each day. I personally used to hate Walmart due to their lack of cashiers but have come to realized that Walmart staff consists of several roles and that cashiers are often short-handed. My Walmart in particular tried to accommodate my complicated schedule but I chose to go ahead and leave due to prioritizing school first (plus my failure to make a decent schedule with University ah-ha). I would recommend those seeking a part time or full time position to give Walmart a chance. My best experience there was probably with fellow team members at Walmart.

Very few opportunities,"Wal-Mart uses propaganda and coersion to keep employees in line. Management claims endless opportunities, yet very few are actually attainable. Zero work/life balance, and inconsistent scheduling lead to exhaustion and depression amongst the vast majority of employees. Hard work is rewarded with harder work and higher expectations, yet no advancement opportunities. Promotees are selected before interviews are ever conducted, giving false hope to hard workers. Hostility and disrespect are commonplace with most management, yet both are specifically forbidden in policy.",2,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Maryville, TN",6/1/17,2017,6,1
Fast Pace and Draining,"Typical day as a manager was to push out your routine in a timely manner. Unrealistic expectations and limited help and support. Every store is ran differently, therefore this is just based of my store experience. Flexible with breaks and lunches. Credability was pushed on DM's even when they had nothing to do with it. Overall I enjoyed my time there, the pay just was not there for some of us. Pay was unfair upon DM's.",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Liverpool, NY",6/1/17,2017,6,1

Typical Wal-Mart Work Environment,"The Wal-Mart on Georgesville Rd is not typically sough after. The management is a bit shoddy, leaving much to be desired from those beneath them. I was personally trained to do the job of 5 separate people; Electronics Associate, Fabric Counter, Paint Mixer, Sporting Goods and Connections (Wireless) Center. I was fully expected to perform above and beyond those roles every day, but was never given a raise to reflect the extra responsibility during my six months working those 5 departments._x000D__x000D_In the end, I was forced to respectfully resign due to repeated scheduling errors in relation to my wife's job.

It wasn't too bad,"It's been a while and I'm pretty sure that there's new management, but that was the worst part of the job. Management seemed to gravitate towards those who could be ""encouraged"" to complete the tasks that other employees couldn't (or wouldn't) in addition to their own tasks. This made for an excessively stressful job. The company was great, the coworkers were mostly wonderful, but the management at the time made it difficult to appreciate the positive parts of employment with them.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Pampa, TX 79065",6/1/17,2017,6,1
Hard work,Not a bad company considering benefits and PTO. But the work is very physical. They have a good 401k they match up to 6%. Most of the managers need more training.

Ridiculous management,"The management at this specific Walmart was very poor. They didn't care at all about school priorities and they would schedule you on days you requested off on a frequent basis. They wouldn't let you go in to try to get times changed unless you asked someone higher than your direct supervisor, and the direct supervisors were very rude to the cashiers.

Poor treatment of associates,"Overall I do enjoy working here though I have been passed up on many well deserved promotions simply because I'm not friends with the right people, not because of lack of experience for those positions.

do not work here if you dont have to,walmart well chew you up and spit you out. they know there are a million other people out there looking for a job and if you cant do what they want they will replace you in a heart beat. i started as a cashier and didnt have too many problems with management. but they moved  me to stocking because we closed at night and i have a back injury and they would constantly berate me for not being able to throw as much freight as every one else.,1,Former Employee,"Overnight Stocker, PART-TIME ","Spokane, WA",5/31/17,2017,5,31

"Good for retail, not for a career.","Raises go up so slowly you'll stay pretty much right at minimum wage. A new hire doing the same job as you can literally be making more than you.

"Very stressfull, expect too much.","They constantly cut hours and help, but always adding more responsibility. They expect your life to revolve around the company. The store manager can take vacation when ever but they have so many weeks of the year that they won't let the rest of us take a vacation. We can't even have Thanksgiving off to be with family because of the sales.

Incompetent Managment,"A typical day at work for me started with finding out what people wanted me to do because 99% of the time I didn't actually work in my department, I worked for everyone else. I was treated like the community peon and while I did very well in my department I didn't get to spend much time there.

not as bad as i thought but management is hit or miss. managers needed to work on attitude and maturity,"I started as a cashier and moved up to a department associate which was nice and I liked it, good people. pay could have been better but some benefits made up for some of it, make sure to ask for a higher pay rate if you think you deserve it, I asked for 8.50 which was more than I had been paid before. at the time I had a year of retail experience but a guy that got hired at the same time just out of high school got 9.50, completely unfair. management had a real attitude problem and the reason I quit was their ignorance to change my schedule even though I gave 3 weeks in advance so that I can work two jobs. of course they told me that if I miss work I will be fired, I quit the second she said that. if that never happened and had different managers I might have still been working there or until I got my degree.",3,Former Employee,DEPARTMENT ASSOCIATE ,"El Paso, TX",5/31/17,2017,5,31
Too much drama,"Some of the associates are very immature and like to spread rumors and start drama. I was okay for a while. When some new associates came in, the drama started.

Fun workplace and good management,"A typical day of work at Walmart was using the register and customer service. Sometimes if an elderly person couldn't bring heavy bags to their car, I would help. I learned more about customer service and how to use other company's registers. I've learned a little bit about stocking, also security because my uncle was security at Walmart. The hardest part of the job was the busiest times around 5, trying to get everyone through the line under a certain amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the managers.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Latham, NY",5/31/17,2017,5,31
"Co-workers were awesome, management not so much","The co-workers by large are excellent individuals and the company's greatest asset. However the Management's growing demands upon the lower management and sales associates is becoming, if not already bordering on the absurd. The company seems to have lost it's original view and goals of respecting the individual and that hard work and skills and knowledge of the job move someone up in the store or company. However I rarely saw any kind of respect for the individual and the only associates I saw moved up were those who had little to no work ethic but were ""favorites"" to one or more of the managers.",2,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Lynn Haven, FL",5/31/17,2017,5,31

You learn the right way to say medications or another thing I learned is a lot about insurances and the difference it provides to a consumer when they only have to pay a co payment. It's also a very confidential job because the customers have to tell you their information in order for you to hand them their medication,it is important to always keep it proffesional and you're feet on the ground,for the same reason that some people need their medication to stay calm they might give you a harder time then other patients but that's when your understanding comes in place.",3,Current Employee,Pharmaceutical Sales Representative ,"Anaheim, CA",5/31/17,2017,5,31

Interesting but fun workplace,"My typical day of work at Walmart would have to be walking in with my badge, punching into the system on the computer in the front then checking the schedule to see what register I'm on whether I'm opening up, breaking a person or taking over. I learned what being a team was, experiencing personalities from different, wonderful beings. Management were a bit of slackers, if you had to code them, it'd take them like 10 mins to get to you when they're with friends, laughing away and talking which is a bit disappointing. The hardest part were the managers not really caring and feel like they have the authority to do whatever they please without any aftermath but the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people, and enjoying a conversation with customers about their life, adventures or their own personal experiences at certain places.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Oneida, NY",5/31/17,2017,5,31

Terrible workplace.,Working at Walmart was a terrible thing for me. Everyday I dreaded going to work because I knew i would get yelled at for a very small thing whether it be by a supervisor or customer. I learned how to be patient and provide excellent customer service. The management was honestly terrible. I was in high school when I started working at Walmart and would need days off due to Business Competitions I participated in and they would be denied. I had even requested for the day of my high school graduation and they gave me every day off that week but graduation day. We were instructed to have a coworker take your shift but everyone would decline. Thankfully I had a friend who would help. There was nothing enjoyable about the job.,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Chubbuck, ID",5/30/17,2017,5,30

terrible place to work,No matter how hard you work they will put you down and say it is not good enough and will run you  into the ground every chance they get.

Productive workplace with great coworkers. People who care about who you are as an individual.,A typical day started at 4 am and lasted until 1 pm. I would be assigned an area to pick in. Usually I was sent to pick the chilled items for grocery pickup orders. I would have to pay attention to dates and search for the item if it was not out on the shelf. The managers pretty much left me alone because I worked hard and they saw that. The culture at Walmart is mixed. There are strict rules to follow such as dress code but you are allowed to express yourself through accessories. The hardest part of the job is when we had 10-13 orders an hour to dispense and we still had picks to take care of when it seemed like you were the only one trying to handle customers out in the parking lot. The best part of the job was seeing the happiness on people's faces as they got their groceries and the relief of them not having to go inside and fight the crowds.,4,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Maryville, TN",5/30/17,2017,5,30

The management was great, such a helpful set of managers. Although, for being an apparel associate, you have to deal with folding all the clothes and watch the customers unfold it right before your eyes. For 9$ an hour, and having to refold over 10 times, is not worth it to me. It involves a lot of bend with stretching. The most enjoyable part was that all the employees got along so well.

Only work here if you have no heart,"The managers were slave drivers that never had enough help to get all the stock done, plus the other shifts passed their work onto the late night shift.  All we had time to do was stock over eight full hours, and if you were even one second over your scheduled work hours they'd put you in a meeting with a manager for being overtime.  Not to mention the company cuts your hours to keep you under a certain income level so that they don't have to give you benefits for working.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Hopkinsville, KY",5/30/17,2017,5,30

cashier,At the time working at Walmart was ok.  The chance for advancement was minimal.  Now I've notice lately that employees are paid so much better and treated better.

Interesting place to work..,"Walmart is an excellent company to work for. However, it's the people that can bring the company down. with my experience in the two store I was employed in.

Don't trust anyone,"The company does not demonstrate any ethical standards, but the employee must do so.  They lie, make false accusations, and are untrustworthy.  There is no respect for the individual! They care more about the un-certified tech that has been employed about 3 months and lies than they do about a 13 year pharmacist .  There is always a high turnover with technicians and cashiers.  Definitely favoritism in the workplace.",4,Former Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,"Harker Heights, TX",5/29/17,2017,5,29

My days at Walmart,"They were long at first until I got used to them, the training took 2 days but I was very inexperienced and wanted to learn as much as possible. The management was alright, the only thing I can think of slightly ""negative"" was one of my CSM's told me to be quicker at bagging on the first day, but we become friends shortly after. I learned how to use a cash register which was nice. Though the time schedule was a bit hectic for a first time job, I should have probably told them I wanted a fixed schedule so that was my bad. The hardest part was probably angry customers to be honest, but there were very few of those. Everyone was nice in my opinion, so that was a good plus for me.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Auburndale, FL",5/29/17,2017,5,29

It's a very stressful place to work.,"Working in walmart as a support manager was a very stressfulplace to work. It's good to work with most of the associates, but to work with the assistant managers and co managers, as for my experienced with them, i could say that they were the worst people I've ever work with. The hardest part of the job, maybe because I am a minority,its seems like I'm the only support manager and they want me to do all the works. The enjoyable part of the job, because the associates respect me as a support manager, so every I told them to do something they follow right away.",2,Former Employee,SUPPORT MANAGER ,"Jacksonville, FL",5/29/17,2017,5,29
Schedules change every week,I enjoyed working with the public. Typical day was 8 hours breaks were usually on time. Management focuses on the negative and not the positive. Benefits are awesome. Schedules change every week.,3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Jackson, TN",5/29/17,2017,5,29

"Poor benefits, poor training","Most of the training you receive is on computers, the training does not prepare you for the real thing. My cashier training on the computer used a completely different model of cash register than the ones used in the store.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Mansfield, TX",5/29/17,2017,5,29
Only if necessary,Walmart is great for those that need some extra money but it is hard to take care of yourself with this as an only job. Management is untruthful and they do not know the meaning of confidentiality. Management is lazy.,1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Humble, TX",5/29/17,2017,5,29

Depends on Area,The experience at Wal-Mart Logistics is fully based on which area you work in and how competitive the area is.  The managers within the warehouse vary from fully qualified managers with previous experience to managers with 1 year with the company and no previous experience of management.  This creates a rift within management and that rift is passed onto the associates in the form of unnecessary stress and blame.  I would recommend working here if you are a hard worker with strong emotional intelligence and are working towards a better opportunity.  There is a high amount of turnover in the warehouse and the effect is felt in lost incentives and poor training.,3,Current Employee,Quality Assurance Specialist ,"Sanger, TX",5/29/17,2017,5,29
It was a good place to work,I have worked at three different WalMart's. job security was good and I got all the hours I needed for a part time worker  they have a lot of different positions to work in,4,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Phoenix, AZ",5/29/17,2017,5,29
Horrible place to work,"Walmart realize to much on a computer to meet and exceed the customers needs and wants.   As a former employee who showed up everyday to work, the management would move you from where you're supposed to be hired for and put you in another area..  Again, because of the computer system, it would cut your hours and expect the shelves to fill themselves and trucks to unload themselves..  Wal-Mart doesn't care about the employees, they don't pay them a decent wage at all..",1,Former Employee,Sales Supervisor ,"Amsterdam, NY",5/29/17,2017,5,29

Hated working here.,"When I worked at Wal-Mart, they would give you some respect but overall it was pretty ridiculous. I would have to go to the bathroom all of the time due to medical reasoning and one of the employees refused to let me go to the bathroom and when that person did let me go, they would huff and puff and talk about me to other cashiers. This person also made me cry several times. Worst place to work.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Barboursville, WV",5/29/17,2017,5,29
Great work experience,"Great work experience, learning new things and ways to deal with certain situations customers may have; Plus all the friendly staff members really helped make the days a little easier and made sure that I got the hang of the job(s) I was working they really knew what they were doing.

Probably one of the most enjoyable jobs I had,"I use to show up early everyday fifteen mins before to go to work. I really enjoyed the people, though some customers were the most unpleasant. Management was understandable and somewhat cool about a lot of things. I enjoyed the diversity of the workplace. There was no hard part other than leaving at a late hour shift and having to show up early in the morning the next day. But the most enjoyable was helping people and getting to put smiles on people's faces. I only left the job because I needed more money for my new wife and child to be in our new home. Other than that I would have kept it.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/CSR ,"McComb, MS",5/29/17,2017,5,29

Walmart associate,"Walmart is better for new hires than for people who have been there for a long time.  New policies have put new hires at a minimum of $10 per hour but there are no holiday pay or compensation other than overtime which is not allowed 90% of the year.  I have worked for Walmart for 5 years and make as much as new hires now.  However Insurance benefits are top notch, but if you miss the November sign up every year you are out of luck.

Interesting Place To Work,Before being able to go on the register you have to go through a lot of computer courses and shadowing a person on the register.

They won't work around anything, they don't think having infectious diseases is good reason to call in. They don't care about doctors notes, you could be on bedrest with lymphoma and they will still expect you to showup. Managers are TERRIBLE. Mean hearted, half wits with little attention to detail. They don't care about employees, or customers, only that they get to make their 50k a year without having to lift a finger. Also, the immense amount of smelly, unkempt and poorly dressed slobs that visit this establishment while buying smart tvs and ipods with government income and cookies and pop with ebt is reason enough to never even apply here.

The management and most of the associates you'll work with are very polite and sometimes humorous and I'll have to say that is the best thing I love about the job, it's very healthy to have some laughs with someone especially at work. The toughest part of the right now job is that some nights we won't have enough people to get the job done for the day so we stay much later than we're supposed to be a d that's why Wal-Mart is hiring so much now.

If you didn't do either one you wasn't going to get anywhere. They picked and chose who was going to move up and do whatever.

I have learned through experience that hard work does payoff in the end, but not at the cost of your health. Work at an efficient pace. Work smarter, not harder. The hardest part of my job is the interaction between myself and the customer in which I'm dealing with, because every customers personality is different and you must adjust yourself to them quickly. Not only is it the hardest part of my job, but it's the best. I'm from a large family and get along great with people I'm told. I'm told that my humorous personality makes my customers feel at ease and they love to shop here.

You will also be required to print out the inventory adjustment report and visit each department suffering theft and shrink. Ive learned while working this job it is very important to be attentive to small details and retail requires much discipline. While working with management, you will realize there are many different types of managers. So who are easy going and others who are by the book.

Great Coworkers and management,I have worked at Walmart for a long time and have recently hit on hard times. I have a son and had to leave his father. They have been great working with me on having certain days off. They have been really supportive and understanding of my situation. Working with the public as a cashier has really opened me up and given me more confidence. Before I was really an introvert and wouldn't speak much at all. Now I can talk to anyone who comes into my lane to check out.The hardest part of the job is when you have a customer who doesn't understand a policy and can get upset about it. Patience is one of the most important things to have and to not have a short temper. Because things can go wrong wherever you work and you need to have an understanding side. The best thing about working at walmart is the family atmosphere that everyone has. The customers are really great.,4,Current Employee,Casher/Customer Service ,"Sheboygan, WI",5/26/17,2017,5,26

Too big for their britches....,"Walmart used to be a good company however they've gotten so big they don't care about their employees anymore.Employees have to fight to get a raise and then when you finally work over a year you might get a $0.15 raise! It's not worth it! The only thing is at Walmart is the great benefits they offer. They're a little high in price, but they're worth it if you need the benefits. I would steer clear of Walmart!",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Chapel Hill, NC",5/26/17,2017,5,26
Very Friendly,"Most friendly team i have worked with, taught me alot about customer service and had great career opportunities.

Not good,A typical day at work at Walmart was to go clock in as soon as you enter the backroom. All the workers would wait for our managers to give us all our daily first meeting. Then after they fill us all in they would call names to tell us what section we would be working in that night. I learned how to use a baler and make bales out of cardboard boxes throughout the night. The management there was terrible to say the least. They always chose favorites even when they told everyone they didn't and cant because its against their job descriptions. Not only that but they would tell everyone your personal business and lie to you about mostly everything that doesn't have to do with work. The hardest part about working at Walmart was working with the managers. The most enjoyable part about working at Walmart was the discount.,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Manchester, NH",5/26/17,2017,5,26
Worst place to work. Store 2005,"Management is very unprofessional, they do not care about the store nor the employees. The benefits are great, they pay decent.

pretty solid,"I liked the job itself, I just didn't like the way management played favorites and there were a lot of double standards.

Working with my coworkers was enjoyable too.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Shipping & Receiving Associate ,"Baden, PA",5/26/17,2017,5,26
hard to get on fulltime,I stocked shelves with product. helped customers find product in the store. and loaded their vehicles with product at different times. management was not around all the time looking over our shoulders,3,Former Employee,Ambassador Caffery ,"Lafayette, LA",5/26/17,2017,5,26

Customer Service and Management,I work at a brand new Wal~Mart and it is a challenging job at best. I am a customer service manager at present. This is a stressful position because of all of the rules the company has set forth. You are expected to keep up with these rules and they change almost daily. The management team has almost unrealistic expectations of all of the employees and the lack of appreciation for all of the hard work they do. It is not an easy place to work and the lack of communication does not help. The company does not give any benefits as far as I am told unless you pay for them like health or dental insurance. They work on a point system if you have to call off for any reason and  have a doctors note or accident or sicknes you are given a point no mater what. After a certain amount of points you can be fired on the spot. I don't feel this is a fair system but I suppose they have their reasons for operating this way.,3,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Derby Center, VT",5/25/17,2017,5,25
"Unprofessional management, many hardworking associates","There is a lot of negative energy and racial tension, primarily in the department I work.

Very demanding place to work,"They say the customer comes first, but they really don't.  Management is never on the same page.  One manager tells you to do something.  Then another manager comes along and tells you to do something else. They never schedule enough people.  Then the one person has to cover 4 departments and gets into trouble when their department doesn't look good.",2,Current Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Leesburg, FL",5/25/17,2017,5,25

Productive steady work place. Very fast pace.,A typical day at work for me was busy. Busy because i kept myself busy. Wal-Mart always has work. I learn how to work with others and I prefer to work alone at times. I love to work. Management I learned control and discipline. Became wiser and even more knowledgeable.

Good place,"I was an over night stocker. You get to know most of your coworkers pretty well if you hang around long enough. It's hard when you start especially when they place you in a department you never stocked before. You just look in the department your placed and see what's in the aisles and once you start pulling boxes from the pallets, you'll have an idea where things go. The only thing I was say is stressful about the job is on the weekends were there is usually two or more trucks. Try to do your best on completing your department but if you can't the managers will send you help. Also, during the holidays especially right before christmas it gets pretty hectic. A lot of customers are shopping during the middle of the night and a lot of freight to put up but you hang on. It's a pretty easy going environment once you get used to it. You have to complete your computer work in order to get paid $10.50 an hr, if you don't it's only $9.50. I would definitely go back to Walmart! If you work hard enough you get offered full time with benefits!",5,Former Employee,Grocery/GM Stocker ,"Wilkesboro, NC",5/25/17,2017,5,25
Shady and unorganized,In my experience the management team is very shady. Hours get cut randomly  whether your full time or part time. It's very unorganized and everyone has different rules. The pro is they pay over minium wage and will usually work around a specific schedule.,2,Current Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,Illinois,5/25/17,2017,5,25
Nice place to work,"A typical day at work is usually good. Co-workers generally are enjoyable and helpful. Management is always available and will help you anyway they can. _x000D_The hardest part of the  job is as an cart pusher you work in all types of weather, your maximum hours you can work is 31 hours but average about 28 and you get paid the least of all the positions at Sams club. Most enjoyable are the customers and my coworkers and working outside on the nice days.",5,Former Employee,Cart Associate ,"Branson, MO",5/25/17,2017,5,25
Does not provide training for employess until you reach upper management.,"My experience at Walmart was for the most part was enjoyable the first year and then they had an overhaul of the upper management. From there the turnover rate went through the roof. They began harping on the associates,and degrading them daily. I would not recommend working for Walmart unless you can start out high in the ranks because of the cut-throat environment with little care for the people but just the numbers. Hours worked over schedule would be made to be taken off through extended lunches,after they ask you to work over.",2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Austell, GA",5/25/17,2017,5,25

Hard to explain the environment,"As a cashier I felt as if I was a bit out of place. All the other cashiers were way older than I was and it was hard getting a long with them. I started to show my interests in advancing within the company and I felt as if the older employees would not respect/listen to me if I were to become a manager of some sort. I was young at the time, so I felt that had something to do with it. I continued to tell my managers that I was still attending college and there were certain times I wasn't able to work, however I was continually scheduled during the requested times off, week after week. I felt as if I was not being listened to and even my younger sister had the same issues nowadays which caused her to leave the company.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Georgetown, TX",5/25/17,2017,5,25

Great Advancement Opportunity with Awful Inexperienced Managers,This store helped teach me how to become a great future leader by showing me everything on how to be an awful one. Most days began with checking email and getting your keys followed by checking up on the front end. During my time here I learned that if you manage to reach a salary position the store owner will not do anything to you no matter what happens or how you treat your the people below you. The store itself was all around a friendly environment. The hardest part of my job was simply the ever changing policy and the mock policy managers would put in place. At times managers would even go against company policy just to help there friends or bend policies to avoid conflicts with other managers. In my opinion this is very unprofessional.The most enjoyable part of this whole job was the drive to work together to finish a task.,3,Former Employee,Walmart Customer Service Manager ,"Beebe, AR",5/25/17,2017,5,25

Walmart,"If you are hired on as a courtesy associate you are often counted upon to perform actions under a specific department. The department  I was under gave me the job to do cart pushing where you collect all the carts in the parking lot and even them out across all entrances of the building.

Despite the seriousness of the higher ranked staff, your fellow employees will treat you with respect and sincerity if you hold up your side of the work. If you are alone you will be expected do all the jobs that your fellow employees would of done which is exhausting. If you do not hold up well being alone the higher staff will start reasoning that your lazy or just aren't working hard.

"great management, easy going co workers, never bored",The Covington Walmart was a pleasant experience from the management team to the tasks.

The management and supervisors seemed to be on top of things and encouraged us daily to take our 15 minute breaks on time along with being steadfast when it came to correcting the registers if an error had occurred. Getting to speak with management about scheduling and improvement was met with no hassle.

It is like drinking from a fire hose all of the time and technologists are never bored there. This especially goes for application development. Opportunities to resolve problems and learn more about anything are available in the conversations that you choose. You can be a part of anything, it is the culture there and there are numerous brilliant, effective people all around you. Be prepared for a start-up mentality where you may not see the effects of what you contribute initially, but keep standing in the truth of your tasking. You will see this massive technology ship's rudder turn ever so slightly and then your idea is working as people are using it to resolve their issues or just do something better, faster,  in 28 countries! I got to share with technologists from from all around the globe. I learned that not only IT Security folks but all of the technologists that we interact with have commonalities in their problems and resolutions, that need to be measured and documented for costs savings and repeat-ability.

A great first job if you want to get into customer service or retail,I actually enjoyed this job. Its a great start to having to deal with customers. You get to learn customer service and how to interact with the public. If everyone did their part this place would be fantastic. The only downside is that the upper management seems to not really care about the average employee.

Great pay/No work/life balance for management,In a salaried position they require your constant commitment regardless of your home-life. There are many inexperienced leaders who are only there for their paycheck and not to take care of their associates or to help the company be successful. There are unrealistic deadlines to meet and no support from other leaders. My associates were the best part of the job. There are so many different personalities and it's a great place to work when those personalities match. Overall if I had the opportunity to work for Wal-mart in a management position again I would decline it. I put in 13 yrs and was very good at the politics of the company.

Keeps you busy but overnight crowd can get kinda weird,"I spent the whole night stocking the electronics department and answering over night phone calls. A large portion of the calls were prank calls which is kind of annoying but it is fun sometimes. Co-workers were really cool and nice, but the managers were often unreasonable.

Most enjoyable part is getting paid",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Austin, TX",5/21/17,2017,5,21
Do your research about the store before you apply,"The company brags about a standard of excellence, however that standard varies wildly between locations.

Productive and Fun workplace,A typical day at Walmart would include checking out customers.  I learned customer service skill and how to disarm angry customers.

"Easygoing, productive and friendly workplace.","Walmart has very great benefits and very good pay. I worked full-time hours with a set schedule. Apart from the days when the management was a little too stressed, it was a very easygoing job with a great team. Overnight stocking was pretty easy, we unpackaged items and placed them on the shelf to the maximum shelf capacity. The customer service we performed was always getting complimented. They also taught me to run the cash register for when they were short on people on the front end  (cash register).",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Warrensburg, MO",5/20/17,2017,5,20

Good job.,I was a sticker & enjoyed working by myself mostly stocking shelves.  The employees are friendly & the customers are too.  I went to work from 10pm to 7 am.

Had to complain because I had to be off in time to make it home to my children.,5,Former Employee,Overnight stocker ,"North Little Rock, AR",5/20/17,2017,5,20

"Company values changed over the years to become more threatening, demanding and unnapreciative.","Always under pressure with threats and intimidation.

Management better treat the hourly associates right, yet upper management does not treat management the same way.",3,Former Employee,Focus Store Manager ,"Las Vegas, NV",5/20/17,2017,5,20
Its not such a good place to work.,Wal-Mart in my opinion is not a good place to work if you have disabilities. The management is very rude to their employees. They want everything done by the end of your shift but they are asking you to do everything else and can't do your own job. Wal mart for me has been the worst place to work at they only care about their jobs and not the employees.,1,Former Employee,Janitor and Cleaner ,"Bellmead, TX",5/20/17,2017,5,20

All about the business,"The job is cool and easy but once people gain power or higher position they let it go to their heads.

On another note, the culture of the company is great.",4,Current Employee,Unloader/Processor ,"Chino, CA",5/20/17,2017,5,20
wouldnt suggest unless no other options,managers lack capacity to take advice from workers or correctly assign number of workers based on workload. may have too many or too few workers but almost never the right amount. low paying jobs storewide so most managers have never had any power so it quickly goes to their heads. often time 2 to 3 managers would come watch as we were undermanned in the backroom unloading a truck. they would sit and watch and talk about why we were taking time instead of leading by example and helping us.,2,Former Employee,truck unloader/stocker/inventory management ,"Dyersburg, TN",5/20/17,2017,5,20

I really don't have anything negative to say?,"The pay was great, and let's be real, my job wasn't difficult. The worst part was going into the freezers, but even then, once you know where everything is you run in and out, no problem. The shifts were long, but everything was fast paced and I got long breaks out of it. I was respected from the get-go, and all of my coworkers were super sweet and willing to help, as well as my mangers, who would run by just to make sure things were okay. I never got a 'high and mighty' vibe from anyone I worked with.",4,Former Employee,Deli/Bakery Associate ,"Goose Creek, SC",5/20/17,2017,5,20
A typical day at work,"I make sure to be ready and out the door so I can get to work at least 30 minutes before ‘start time.’ That way if there are delays such as traffic I’m still on time for any meetings or important tasks. I check voice mail and the calendar, then plan my sit down work time around other things like meetings. Sometimes it’s hard to balance between being friendly and keeping on task, but people understand that I don’t like to chit chat during the day – I like to work.”",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Atlanta, GA",5/20/17,2017,5,20

Fast paced and hectic workplace.,"A typical day at work would consist of, answering phone calls, helping customers, stocking, cleaning your department, organizing, customer service and online orders. I learned to multi task and to be fast and efficient. Workplace culture was not always the best because sometimes management would not manage every employee.

Easy to get entry level positions.,Easy to get started but management teams only care about the bottom line and are not flexible. Most of the people are outgoing and fun to be around.

People don't matter only numbers do,"Numbers and senior management being able to barely be at work is the number one priority.  Dealing with employees outside of telling them they are not doing good enough is not a priority. There is no professional development other than saying you need to do better.  There is no work/life balance unless you are senior management.  Don't ask management any questions because you will get a different answer from every manager.

Could be better depending on how the customers treat you and others,"I've enjoyed most of my time with Walmart but some managers tend to lack the necessary training needed to do their jobs such as managing schedules, listening to their underlings, and not writing anything down. Hours tend to be the biggest problem people have working at any of the stores I've worked at since that's the easiest thing they can do to balance the budget. The only downside to this is that they never have enough people to cover the necessary areas. Of the stores I've worked at this actually affects the profits cause either customers can't find what they're looking for since no one is there to help or it hasn't been stocked since there isn't enough employees. There's probably no real fix to this cause it's an uphill battle but I think part of the problem is people now a days don't want to work and the ones who do aren't making enough to survive. Though i guess if they had more employees around the store they could deter theft somewhat since more feet on the ground means less area to conceal the acts.",3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Clarksburg, WV",5/20/17,2017,5,20

Rotating the new and old product. Filling the floor. Also maintaining a clean environment both on the sales floor and in the backroom. I've learned skills such as teamwork, knowing ""good"" product from ""bad"" product, and time management. The Management at Walmart is effective and helpful when it comes to certain objectives we may be confused about. Walmart is a diverse culture with no discrimination. Everybody is treated fairly and equal. The hardest part of the job is getting all the objectives done within the shift time due to different events happening each and every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of self accomplishment after completing each task.

I love seeing customers faces and helping them with anything they need. Customer Service has always been my thing. The management there is alright, I can say they make sure the job gets done and everything goes how it is supposed to throughout the night.

I love this place! I just get treated like trash.,"I love the system of Walmart.I love how it works. Honestly, i really do love the idea of this place, but they need to work on a few things. The Managers are the main thing I'm talking about. I understand it can be hard to control all the associates in a big place, but at least keep control of the people who are supposed to be managers! They treated me like complete garbage! I am usually a fairly humble guy, but I feel like I was controlling one and a half departments on my own and all they ever focused on was other people's mistakes and blamed it on me. I was not a manager by the way, but I still got in trouble for their mistakes! They would never get on to them, just me. (sorry for the rant) Other than that, I love that job. I learned to keep my cool in stressful situations. Sometimes we have pick up where other people slack. Hardest part of the job was trying to control people knowing i have no power over them whatsoever.

Work with some very...interesting people, and management is back and forth with no idea what they are yelling about. Job itself is tiring and unrewarding, but the pay is decent for a retail job and being in the back you don't have to deal with customers very often.

Customer First Policy Disastrous,"Unhappy associates due to oppressive work environment and favoritism; as a result unqualified associates get promoted; higher ranks depend on lower ranks for guidance in simple procedures.The question is, how does one become a manager when they are clueless about simple register operations. Management instils fear in associates because threats of being fired are a common feature, as a result customer service delivery suffers.

It is a good starting point for future jobs,"At the beginning of the shift we down stacked the pallets by placing the product on carts for each specific aisle. Once everything was down stacked we moved to our assigned aisles and started stocking. The goal was to go as fast as you could in the allotted amount of time, while paying attention to out-of-dates and damaged product. In conjunction with the main task we were to assist the customer with their questions and needs. Management was on a rotating basis so every 6 months or so we would see a new face, the third shift was a make it or break it deal. For the most part management had no clue, as to what the job entailed. As we were told so many times that the store would fail if it weren't for us. Sometimes it felt like high school, people would develop their own cliques and if you weren't part of their group they wouldn't give you the time of day. The hardest part of the job was the constant up and down, the physical wear and tear on my body, working in extreme temperatures, no a/c during the hot summer months, no heat during the winter. I learned how to work quickly and efficiently, how to use a Gemini to scan for outs and check shelf caps. I learned how to build a display. I learned that everyone is expendable.

Used to be a alright company to work for.....used to be.,"Walmart isn't what it used to be. Back when i first started working there they seemed to actually somewhat care about the employees. They gave generous bonuses every quarter, a decent performance based raise every year and were very understanding of any needs or problems that occur in a employee's life. This has changed drastically with in the past year and a half or so. First off they promised to increase wages for all employees, even made a big deal of it on the news. At the time I was making around $10.05 a hour, I started out at $7.50. I earned that pay after years of performance based raises. Of course when I heard of the increase in wages i got excited, till they went into effect. At first they only increased the starting pay for new hires and bumped that up drastically. To my dismay I learned that the new hires were making MORE than me at $10.20. They keep promising to give the more senior employees raises later on in the year. When they finally decided to do so, months after the initial increase, i was shocked once again to find that they were only increasing my wage to meet the new hire increase. So yes, the new hires are making just as much as me now. It seems Walmart couldn't care less about their more senior employees. _x000D__x000D_Now on to the quarterly ""bonuses"" that they give us now. When i first started working there the bonuses averaged around $250-$350, highest i seen was $460 something. Which is a very nice batch of dough. But soon after the raises our bonuses kinda became lack luster. My last bonus was a whooping $44 and they average around $30-$120.

Hard Workplace to excel in,"Log into their computer's that are way back in the store, then stock your cart, sometimes they will have meetings before that you have to attend and then stock your cart. Ask the supervisor which isle's you are doing. Example: cereal, canned foods, produce, etc. They say cereal, so you and another co-worker are assigned 3 to 4 isle's to do for the entire shift. First day was a little different, where they have a supervisor help you which is great at it, so you generally feel like your doing good for the first day, until you get another co-worker that is somewhat confused about things like you. Management expects you to get your 2 to 3 carts worth done by the end of your shift, which is freaking impossible, but since you can't this is what happens. The manager and supervisor's call you into the office and tell you how terrible you are doing and say you should do better and send you back to work. Now if I was running Walmart, that wouldn't be what I would do, but if I heard that, that had happened, I would have fired them all!",3,Former Employee,Team Member ,"Cañon City, CO",5/17/17,2017,5,17

Wal*Mart great opportunity awaits.,There are a vast number of positions at Wal*Mart. What I learned at Wal*Mart was how to build a team buy building the individual. You will interact with some of the best people in the world. Workplace culture is unique and encourages diversity. Many fa-sits of management leading the way to complete daily tasks. Hardest part of the job is walking leaving at the end of the day if your tasks are incomplete.

Would never work for this company again,"If you feel like crying in the morning, during lunch and after work because you're in so much pain you can barely stand, I would recommend this job. This is a corporation that only cares about how it can make more money, with no regard for its employees. They can, and will, work you to the bone if they get the chance to take advantage of you. I was lied to about how promotions worked and missed out on a raise because of it. I wasn't allowed to take a break if I needed one outside my strict 15 min breaks or strict 30 min lunch break. My ankles and calves were swollen every day because of that job, and what they pulled during tax season was a serious joke. I couldn't get my W-2! They wouldn't let me have it no matter what I did. Called HR, called my Walmart, tried mytaxform.com, went to the IRS building in CO Springs, and still couldn't get it! This company is a joke. Oh, and if you skipped more than 3 days work in an entire YEAR, you would get fired. Didn't matter if it was because you were terminally ill, or a death happened in the family - you had to use vacation time you accrued to get off. The only way to get vacation time was to work 40 hours to get 1 hour vacation time. And before you could get that, you had to work for 3 months with no vacation time accruing first. AND they demonize unions like they're such a bad thing because they don't want to be ""fair"" to their employees.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Woodland Park, CO",5/15/17,2017,5,15

incompetent management,"Most of the assistant managers or higher don't have a college degree until you get to the corporate level. Its very hard to work for a company where they treat the hardworking employees just like the incompetent employees. Micro managing is a big issue. plus it is infuriating to to work for people and know your getting a fraction of there pay but yet they still come to you asking how to fix something or set up something that is beyond them. I would not recommend working for this company if you have a above average intelligence or even a normal intelligence. the staff will infuriate you with their stupidity, lack of effort and poor communication skills.
