awful company to work for,Walmart does not honor all employees. They only cared about management. At the time that I worked there the pharmacy manager was extremely crass to all the employees,1,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Birmingham, AL",4/23/19,2019,4,23

Everything is a firedrill which causes a lot of stress.",5,Current Employee,Replenishment Manager III ,"Bentonville, AR",4/23/19,2019,4,23
Poor Management,The atmosphere in Walmart is very poor. Management and H.R were very slow on many issues that came up. They expected 120% from the employees but only gave back 50%.,1,Former Employee,Front End Manager ,"Americus, GA",4/23/19,2019,4,23

Terrible Management,"I worked here as an early morning stock associate. The management was poor and lacked communication with each other. You'd only be allowed six days *a year* to call out. Even with a doctors note, you'd still get points for being absent. No absences were excused unless you previously got that day off approved. No work/life balance at all. Everyone who worked here was unhappy and hated the job. They paid no where near enough for the amount of stress that came with the job. The managers expected certain task to be done within a certain amount of time even though we were completely understaffed. Only holiday you'd for sure have off is Christmas day. Terrible job and I would NEVER go back here. Only good thing is the a flexible schedule with the days and amount of hours you'd want to work.",2,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Buford, GA",4/23/19,2019,4,23

Productive and fun workplace with a lot of management issues. Overall a good place to grow and meet great people.,I've met a lot of good people there.

Terrible mangement,"Although they paid decently, Walmart is not the place to work at if you wanted to be treated fairly and with respect. They no longer accept a doctors note if you get sick and will only allow 4 missed days before they let you go. So better not get sick and no one else either",3,Current Employee,Tire Lube Express Technician ,"Tahlequah, OK",4/23/19,2019,4,23

Very high paced retail,"Wal-Mart is and always was an awesome place to work until I was introduced into an department management role and abused verbally and physically through the impossible tasks implemented on a daily basis. In retail there is always room for improvement but to this employer there is only time for improvement and his ideals towards production goals became unreasonable and most times crazy. Our store manager would push 3 people's work load on me aswell as the work I already had while giving me no help and then repremanding me when i was unable to finnish. I was later fired from this job because I had to take 3 days off due to an illness I had no controle over. I followed all the rules and provided all the appropriate doctors information/ excused from work notices, but was denied leave coverage after the fact for only taking off work for a 3 day period instead of 4. This forced me to acceded my amount of points thus resulting in termination. Note that in order to have an acceptable leave of action you must take more than 3 days off. This information is not provided to employees.",4,Former Employee,Candy Department Manager ,"Paris, TN",4/23/19,2019,4,23
no job security anymore,no job security anymore. they do have prolly the best technician support of the big chains though. lots and lots of rules that must be followed or you will get coached (written up). all the budget cuts make them seem like they are gonna turn into walgreens espicially since their new head of pharmacy is ex walgreens.,4,Former Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,"Jackson, MO",4/23/19,2019,4,23
Fun,Overnight Stockingwas fun but not for overnight with an hour lunch it was to much downtown and mad you so sleepy sitting for an hour. When an employee was threatening me for no reason and  I didn’t even know them management let them go but when there was another employee that was messing up my job and choked me on the clock because I peacefully confronted her about Lying on other coworker and myself and I made a police report management did not let her go. I didn’t feel safe and ultimately decided to end services,4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"San Jose, CA",4/23/19,2019,4,23

No advancement and mandatory overtime,they said you worked 4/10s but you almost always had to work 5/10s._x000D_There was no way to get anything non work related done.

"Painfully average job, new CEO and heads ruined it for me.","Its a great job if you enjoy always moving or doing something. Regular shifts for pickers were 5am-2pm and 6am-3pm. I was 6am-3pm, a full 8 hour shift with 1 hour lunch, working 40 hours a week, but the company still considered me part time. Anyone that isn’t a salaried member of management is considered part time. Online grocery itself is great but is naturally super stressful, even more so when you have customers demanding attention in person. I left because I was expected to handle in person customers while also maintaining my performance of 100 items per hour while picking. Its a totally feasible performance goal, but only if you dont have to constantly deal with customers. I also really disliked the direction walmart management is heading in. They’re planning to get rid of most, if not all, department managers and severely cutting down on assistant managers, leaving us beginner employees to do their job as well as our own while managing to still pay us essentially minimum wage. I did make 50¢ over minimum wage doing online grocery ($11.50 after the minimum increase at the beginning of 2019), but it still wasn’t nearly enough to try to move out on my own. Bottom line, walmart is a great first job and starting point, but dont be afraid to branch out after you’ve got 6 months experience. You can DEFINITELY do better once you can show you have some retail experience. Also just an FYI, its almost impossible to get a job at Target after working for Walmart. I’ve tried twice, my boyfriend that works at Walmart currently has tried 3 times, and many of my former coworkers had tried - more...",3,Former Employee,PERSONAL SHOPPER ,"Gilbert, AZ",4/23/19,2019,4,23

had potential,"This company would have been great to work for if it wasn't for the management. They were very picky with who they let advance in the company.

"Awful place to work, terrible management","Walmart is really going downhill. In my 2 years of working there, I helped out in nearly every department, even changed my job title to cartpusher since they can’t keep any. Surprise, when you treat people like they aren’t worth anything they’re gonna leave! All the managers that supposedly liked me severely retaliated against me when I changed my job title since I couldn’t do things for them anymore. If it weren’t for me, they’d all be out there actually doing work, instead of them hanging out in the office together having their daily Starbucks/pizza party. Since I’ve left I’ve been back in my store a few times and it’s an absolute mess.

Bad experience,"The store I worked at rewarded those that did little and held back those that worked hard. The management staff were not real knowledgeable on the policies of the department in which I worked and would want things done the wrong way. When mentioning that the way they wanted it done was wrong, they insisted it be done anyway. I could also never have an issue resolved in a timely manner, or receive an adequate response to questions about policies. All in all, I had a real bad experience worked ng for this company.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Customer Service ,"Gaylord, MI",4/23/19,2019,4,23
Horrible,Horrible place to work if you are trying to be a manager. No work/life balance you are there when they tell you or look for a new job. Store and market managers are hard to deal with if you like swallowing your pride then this job is for you this is not a career move and if so I'm sorry.

"Great Starter Job, but not a great Idea for a Career","I started working for Walmart as an overnight stocker, but was soon promoted to overnight Support Manager.  I was in charge of training and development, disciplining associates, and managing and delegating workflow tasks.  The company does not offer flexible schedules or competitive pay, but many of the associates are genuinly wonderful to work with.  Unfortunately, the company continues to strip employee benefits over time and offers no opportunity for advancement from within, preferring to hire salaried members of management from the outside.  Many of the managers are paid well below market and there are quite a few that lack integrity or scruples.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Support Manager ,"Urbana, IL",4/23/19,2019,4,23

Glad I'm gone!,"You will rarely see a raise, they don't approve time off, you will likely have to work all holidays, and the schedule is random. Upper management talks down to employees and can be very disrespectful. Customers can also be rude, although some can be very kind.

Nobody should work at Walmart,"Walmart has a turnover rate of 95%. People are constantly leaving and people are constantly being fired. I've come to believe that they have embraced their high turnover rate, and instead of trying to fix it, they just hire more warm bodies to replace those who leave, and drive THEM until THOSE people leave. They run the store like a correctional facility. Since cracking an actual whip is illegal, they do it verbally. No worker is ever doing a good enough job. They have to be driven to work harder. Hard work is never appreciated. All workers are suspect. I've been chewed out just for going to the bathroom. I don't do it often and I don't do it to get out of work. I only do it when I have to go, like 99% of the workers. The bottom line is that management doesn't give a rat's butt about the employees. No one is happy there. They need to fix that, but they continue going in the opposite direction. I've heard it used to be a decent company to work for, but that company is gone.",1,Current Employee,Stock Clerk/Customer Service ,"Hattiesburg, MS",4/23/19,2019,4,23

Bad place to work,They dont care about your family or your life outside of work. The flexible schedule they talk about is a lie. Most of the management is a joke and only care about theirselves. They promote people that dont deserve it and that have no idea what they are doing. They are constantly changing policies and how hours are given out so its hard to keep track of what's going on.

Challenging but nice place to work for.,"Working for Walmart requires you to always be on your feet, being able to get the tasks you are assigned to done a soon as possible. Walmart does pay you fairly depending on what your current financial status is.

Decent pay for seasonal work,"Working 2nd shift at Walmart was relatively easy, but it could become monotonous very quickly. It is not a job I could keep for a long period of time.

strees,Well all have to say I'll never going back to that. They never have what I need. They stack same products in different aisle. Not enough staff for the amount of customers. I guess people go there because it's convenient. The staff is so tired that they don't even smile. I don't blame them. In the products departments is hard to find the plastic bags. I could go on but I'm tired. I just came from there and waiting 30 min to self pay.

Workplace Culture,"Culture has shifted from what Sam Walton created. The days of feeling like part of a family and desire to make Walmart a career are over.

Would Not Recommend,"I would say if you can come to work everyday knowing that you will be getting yelled at and sometimes belittled for your average or above average work than this is the place for you.  Management had a strong bias to people and did not show an advance to care for associates.  Management is incredibly mean and will talk behind your back unless you are in the 1% of people that they like.

Not best place to work but a job,"Management wouldn't work with you if needed to switch hours. Hrs would even get cut like a punishment.

Every week had a new itinerary where they would dump someone else's job onto the Cap Team. My direct supervisor would not speak up for us even when he knew wrong was happening.

Overall was a good place to work at to learn what you want to do,"A typical day at work involves helping customers throughout the day with not only pharmacy questions but also general questions of the stores customers.

It was a temporary job but I liked it.  Just last year I started working at another Wal-Mart to supplement my social security.  What a huge difference.  This time around is a total nightmare. Management is greedy and since they gave us that so-called raise and they’ve cut our hours so bad nobody sees an extra dime.  It’s hard work for very little pay. Management doesn’t want to help you, they treat you like you’re a slave. I’m still there but actively seeking other employment.

Ok Place to Work,I worked overnight at Walmart. The primary problem I had was the lack of available childcare options available for working overnight shifts in my area.

There isn't many opportunities to sit down, and it's normally to a point you're constantly busy to even sit. Plus, there are a lot of codes and whatnot to be remembered, especially for cashiers and grocery. This job keeps you on your feet, and has times where they want you to lift heavy objects.

Very Stressful,"Like any other jobs, pros and cons. Walmart was my first real job as full time. I went into Walmart with a desire to reach the top levels an employee can reach. I came to realize very quick that their inventory system was not what I liked. So it became stressful day by day. As kid with big dreams and high hopes to make something out of my day time just kept shrinking. Make this short it was good cause I was enjoying the overtime but most of the time I was forced to do the overtime to finish up tasks. All in all I'm grateful I went through that experience. Taught me a lot.",3,Former Employee,IMS Associate ,"Enid, OK",4/22/19,2019,4,22
Great company.,Walmart is a really great company to work for. The offer so much there. A bonus 4 times a year.

An interesting place.,"Its a fast paste job and working environment. Not everyone was bad to work with, however, management can be very poor depending on the department of choice. I enjoyed organizing the merchandise, stocking the shelves and interacting with the customers to help them meet their shopping needs.

Terrible,"Walmart started out well, but quickly went down hill. People hired was very unprofessional. Gossip was rapid, too many young immature people working here, prompting meetings about the dress code and among other things, the meetings was a waste of time. Training was a continuous thing because there was constant change which made no sense. Pay was not good. Supervisors didn't know their jobs so they were unable to assist associates. When questions was asked there was 20 different answers. No one was ever on the same page when it came to processes or procedures. Walmart employee discount was not worth it.

Giving In and Out competition for name,"I have worked at Walmart in their online grocery dept. for a good 2 years now. I'm putting in my 2 weeks notice now, and it's for a collection of reasons._x000D__x000D_First off; Walmart is NOT somewhere that shows opportunity for those who want to gradually make more, get promoted, or a long term career. I say this because for the past two years (and the past 3 months more specifically) my dept. has seen upwards of 10 people either get fired, put in two weeks notice like myself, or just outright quit. _x000D__x000D_This is due to management, which at Walmart is unrelentingly strict and disorganized. Management only seems to put themselves first, with an example being my manager stating that she will ""make sure that nobody else takes (her) job, even if it means she has to fire our whole department."" I'm all for having a relaxed demeanor for a manager's personality, but when you mix that with comments like that and improper treatment of those with disabilities such as Asperger's (such as myself) to a point where they break down crying...you are not hiring the right people to lead. Heck, The Boy Scouts taught me things that half these managers don't seem to even know, and that was taught to me when I was a KID. _x000D__x000D_Morale's in the garbage most of the time, favoritism in race is common within stores depending what the majority race for management happens to be, and corporate/in store management in general show horrid communication and cooperation with those on the front line of their customer service!

Fair place to work.,No chance for re-hire as a cashier. Walmart no longer using cashiers. They are going to ALL self check outs. I think this will be a BIG mistake for their business.

Overall a great work experience for myself with a diverse clientele.,Not a bad part time job. I am certain there is room to move up with in the company but i did not see a career in the company.  Being a cashier was a multitasking position due to lack of employment in other departments.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Retail ,"Lima, OH",4/21/19,2019,4,21
Could be better managed,They have the basis for good work ethic and great strides in retail. The associate pool is to knowledgeable in retail to accomplish the results walmart would like. They want people on time limits as factories and presses do. In my opinion it's a great method but the associates are majority of people who dont take the job serious enough. This results in overload on good workers until they leave while bad associates stay for years,3,Former Employee,Fresh supervisor ,"Middlefield, OH",4/21/19,2019,4,21

About Customer Host,"Everyday at Walmart was about the same to me. Greet the customers upon entrance. Now not only do we greet we check receipts. A customer with any unbagged items, your required to ask for there receipt. Now if a customer refuses to show you their receipt you can't argue just say say have a nice day,and continue your day.

"A good first job, but can be very stressful.","As I started working at Walmart I had to adapt quickly or get left in the dust. Working there you have to make concise decisions and help the customer with whatever they need. They had me working everywhere there and most of the time I would be in my position by myself.

The management did their best to the best of themselves and I never had a problem with them.

Stressful and fast paced environment,The main issue with Walmart is conflict between persons and the employee's best never being good enough.

Micro-managed,"I have never disliked a job that I have had until this one.  Micro-managed and store security watches your every move and falsely accuses of taking 12 minute breaks instead of 10 minutes, walking away from work area to get snacks when it is not break time.  I have never and did not ever do any of these things although there were other team members that did but somehow store security claimed that it was me instead, which was an absolute fabrication of the truth or an outright lie.  My father had a grave illness during three months of my employment and I never missed a day of work but had some late arrivals to work coming from the hospital and trying to assist my mother who was having a hard time functioning during my father's illness.  Walmart does not tolerate late arrivals, which is understandable when you are trying to run a company, but they have no empathy for those that are doing so as a result of a legitimate and very stressful family situation.  I do not have to have a pat on the back for everything but appreciation of the fact that I never missed a day of work during this time would have been appreciated.   Team member efforts are very unappreciated.  Terrible pay in comparison to your experience.  I surmise that the company was looking for a reason to get me to leave so they became knit picky about everything and started accumulating lies to add to my workday history to backup their story.  _x000D__x000D_Hard to get a full-time position.

VERY STRESSFUL and the pay doesnt equal to that amount of stress,"EVERYDAY and I mean every day there will be a customer that is disrespectful.

I worked in the self-checkout and they expect you to catch people stealing, but when you do you're supposed to call Asset Protection. Even when I would catch people AP did nothing. And the CSMs were a joke. If I needed help they would take their lovely time to come. The only good thing about Walmart is that they pay 11/hr but in my opinion, we should make more.

Walmart not a good store to work for,Worst job place I ever worked for. Manger suck people working there bad attitude. I will never work for a walmart ever in my life again.

Great company to advance your career.  Horrible for family life.,"I started for Wal-Mart as an hourly associate in the deli. I never worked for retail company before and I did not imagine ever having a career with Wal-Mart.   In 2004 the culture and Managment teams were amazing and lived by Sam Walton teachings. My managers made me believe I could be somebody and have a great career.  The last promotion in my career was to a co manager position. That was only 2 years after I had started in the deli.  I went from making $8 an hour as a deli associate to making $60,000 as a shift manager.  Wal-Mart taught me how to be a leader.  Paid me extremely well and they have great benefits. I have worked all over the West coast and Wal-Mart paid for every relocation. I loved Wal-Mart.   What soured my opinion of Wal-Mart is eventually the belief in the culture of Wal-Mart I experienced wasn't as important as it used to be.  The old school Managment teams were retiring i don't know. But the culture soured.  I found this out the hard when I was injured on the job.  I had worked, lived, and breathed for Wal-Mart over 10 years and I was injured unloading a truck.  I miss the use of my arm for 3 months.   And I just couldn't be the same work till i drop manager and unfortunately I was forced to step down as a manager. All those years of blood sweat and tears I felt were for nothing.  Cause as soon as I couldn't physically do it I was basically forced out. Nothing really mattered anymore but stocking times and customer lines.  Wal-Mart provided me with the tools to succeed and I am forever grateful. Just don't get hurt there. Also upper Managment has no stability - more...",4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Cedar City, UT",4/21/19,2019,4,21

Workplace Issues,"The employees are not very nice to each other and there is a lot of jealousy.

not worth the time,"Turn over is high, management is a joke, they switch manager every few months, if a manager dis-likes you for any reason they will try to get you to quit before firing you.

stressful,if you're willing to put up with management constantly demanding something from you even when you're already working on something then this is the job for you.

Management was good, you get time off and paid sick and vacation days. You don't have to bring a lunch because you can buy food at work. The AC was super cold and strong during the hot months, which in turn made it more comfortable to work and bring out the best in workers. I did not like, however, how they never had enough workers to push carts. They would have me do it, although I was maintenance and was not supposed to. It's a small store and it would get pretty packed during the holidays, so it was a little chaotic during those times.",4,Former Employee,MAINTENANCE / STOCKER ,"Clovis, CA 93611",4/20/19,2019,4,20
I don't like the company as a whole.,"I liked most of my coworkers (managers included), I didn't have a problem with them or if I did it wasn't a big issue. The company itself was frustrating. I wasn't able to change my schedule very easily, having to wait at least a month every time I needed a schedule change. I had to go to my supervisor every week because of schedule conflicts, such as my shift being outside of my availability or being at the same time as my college classes. Working part-time and being in college at the same time, I was also very frustrated that my week hours were normally 35-39 hours, just under full-time except I get no full-time benefits. It stayed like that for months, mostly closing shifts while I had an 8am, 3 hour long class 4 days a week, before my availability form went through. Also, around when the holidays started, myself and my coworkers took notice that our hours were all cut drastically (full shifts turning into half shifts short enough you wouldn't get lunch). Fewer hours, less pay, and apparently, there weren't any shifts we could pick up either. I quit before the new year, but one of my former coworkers told me that while the hourly wage went up one dollar with the new year, her hours were also cut so she isn't making any more money. Frankly I just find it sad and frustrating. So here's what I think, your walmart associates and coworkers may be good people and having good people as a face for the store is also a good thing, but the company itself I don't like, and I really do not want to work in a walmart ever again if I can help it.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Oxnard, CA",4/20/19,2019,4,20

A place to work that can be enjoyed when you like the fast pace.,"Walmart was a great place to work because there was always something to do and the hours went by fast. Depending on the store, the management team can be a good team and willing to work with you and your needs as well as keeping things under control. There was always room to improve and advance within the company. Everyone worked well with others and Walmart work with peoples needs and cultures. Walmart now only provides part time work so if looking for full-time, this is not one to work for. One thing that I hated  was that if I wanted to move from one department in the store to another, there was the possibility that I would loose wages per hour and possible hours. I enjoyed working with everyone including the managers. Unfortunately, the store I was at was a manager training store and there were times that some of the managers that come in didn't care about other needs only that we did what we were told.

I will also include as the reward they did give us the ability to accumulate protective time off in addition to the regular time off where both are acquired by the # of worked hours.

Terrible and getting worse.,"Tripling of workload with cut in pay, severe cut in hours, and paid time off accrual.

Walmart is not a good company,"I wake up every morning pumped to walk into work... sounds cliché, but so true! The culture is unlike any company I've come to work for or interviewed for. Everyone in the Glassdoor community is truly genuine and extremely helpful in all aspects. Upper management will help you focus on your next career steps, in setting up mentorships and having one-on-ones to meet your goals.

Constantly walking on eggshells. They are looking for a reason to fire the drivers. Very stressful eld system.,Job sucks work every weekend. Slip seat trucks 3-4 times per week. Benefits are a thing of the past. The other drivers for the most part are friendly and very helpful. Most of the managers will help you as much as they can. Walmart has mainly turned into forced dispatch,1,Former Employee,Truck Driver for the following companies ,"Midway, TN",4/18/19,2019,4,18
Not as good as it used to be,"They have made alot of changes in the past two years, and most are not good. Raises are no longer based on work preformance, or how long you have worked there, and it's not right. The starting pay went up but did nothing for those of us who have worked there 10 or more years, so now new hires are making almost as much as us.

Unique Experience,Walmart can be a great job. Many people spend there entire lives working at Walmart.  If you are young high school pre-college. You don't have any responsibilities have flexible hours. This is the place for you. Walmart has an amazing culture where they make you feel like family and you can be anything you want to be. Pizza a parties and bbq. This is the good. However the bad is you will be underappreciated and singled out for trying to shine. The moment you want to become a DM or ASM or SM. This is where the struggle comes. You will go through a hazing process where they will give you a extra hard time and watch you under a magnifying glass.  After a few years you will be able to move up. The way everything is structured it's extremely hard to move up when other people above you are not moving. For example if you have a DM that has been the DM for 10 years you may want to go other department if you want to be a DM.  It's a complicated path.  There is a priority at Walmart where the longer you have been there the more your opinion matters. Another thing is some managers will exploit you.,3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,Maryland,4/18/19,2019,4,18

A simple job that is made stressful for no reason,Worked in produce. We had a 95% turnover rate all the way to assistant manager. They were often actually cruel and engaged in illegal activity.

Productive and fun enviroment to work in.,Wal-Mart was the first career I endured. It was high strung but it also taught me many things. My work ethics were formed majorly at Wal-Mart.

My First Job Experience,"Working at Walmart was my very first paying job and even though I was only able to work 3 days because at the time I was attending Gerald R Ford Job Corps in Grand Rapids,MI and they helped me get the job but as soon as I got hired they pretty much told me I was on my own even though they had told me before I went for my interview they would help me to get to and from work until I got paid. Then when I got hired they did the polar opposite of what they agreed to. So, due to lack of transportation and poor area I could not get to and from work. But, those 3 days was the best 3 days I have worked, I enjoyed the staff and just working so I could afford things that I wanted to buy. My typical work day was clock in at about 8:30 am to 9 am and I only had 2 breaks and I worked in the clothing department where I cleaned out dressing rooms, put clothes back on hangers and retag them and put them on the racks and then I helped ring people up at the cash register in the clothing department. I learned how be patient and how to talk to people and how to stay under pressure during stressful times.",5,Former Employee,Clothing Sales Associate ,"Grand Rapids, MI",4/17/19,2019,4,17

"It has it's Great moments, and Nightmare moments","In the beginning of when I started working here it was awesome, friendly, and some associates treated you like family. Learned a lot of customer service. The main thing is that when you are working in this place to need to not have a short fuse. There will be horrible customer, and there will be horrible managers.The pay is really fair, but it is not worth it if its gonna make you hit into depression. _x000D_   Everything is all about honesty, and integrity. Actually, this company does not go by it. It goes by favoritism. Certain Assistant Managers will treat you like a slave, support managers will micro manage you, and they don't by your online training. they will do it their ""own way""._x000D_when it comes to your daily personal life you won't have time for it, due to exhaustion. since this place is a super-center it has almost everything. You will be pulled by all sorts of people for help, and  you will get lazy employees. _x000D_   Another thing is that in this company you will have great moments such as bonuses depending how long you been there working, how many consecutive hours you mane, and how many times you did not call - out. You will have bar-be-que's, ice cream parties, pizza parties, sometimes you will get awesome mexican food. Of course you will only get that if the store reach a certain goal of sales, and no shrinking. you will get low hours in the beginning, but once you start working there for a while it will get raised._x000D_   Will I reccomend this store to other people? well on'y if you are able to keep a poker face to stupidity from customers, and associates, able to not show - more...",3,Former Employee,"Cashier, Stocking, Customer Service ","National City, CA",4/17/19,2019,4,17

bad management,"at the time that I worked there i had no manager whatsoever and we had to be told what to do by a supervisor who was always busy with other things so they where always hard to find when something was happening. also not enough equipment for everyone its all first come first serve so if you didn""t get what you needed early you had to find something else to do until you were able to get a hold of a supervisor. because i had no direct supervisor no one was able to work with my schedule, and i would get scheduled to work on the days or the times that i was not available and wrote down on my availability sheet.",3,Former Employee,Fresh Food Associate ,"Humble, TX",4/17/19,2019,4,17

It's a handful,"The summary said it all. Not into long winded reviews but to be frank, I knew going in to retail that it could ad would be stressful. Walmart takes the cake or at least the one I worked at. If you are in need of a job or down on your luck I say take it but by no means do you attempt to make that place a career and when you get settled in be sure to put your goals and personal life FIRST! If you don't you'll find yourself looking older than what you are and the days will go by where all you do is go to work and go home stressed out not wanting to deal with anything or anyone including your own children. I'm not there anymore and I feel free as a bird!!! I sometimes go shopping there and when I see some of my old co-workers they look miserable. But again this isn't to slander the place because again that is going to be the going rate for many retail stores so I say go in with a temporary mindset and get your ducks in a row while you are there because that place will attempt to hold job security over your head.",3,Current Employee,Hourly Associate ,"Jackson, MS 39204",4/17/19,2019,4,17

If you can get past the complaining, the place isn't too bad. Managers have high expectation but low standards. You can get away with not doing much, but you won't go anywhere. It's easy to stand out as a good worker, since just a good attitude will do it. Work hard on top of it, and you're gold. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job is the lack of appreciation.

Who you know,"Unfortunately, this seems to be more about who you know and not your skill set. Networking of course always helps a career. However, I have watched plenty of people become store managers and fail because they didn't have the skill set but did have the networking piece.

Team work,Store manager and up does not help promote team work with all associates and all store.

It started to get harder to even be excited about the job after so long but I put a smile on my face anyways for my customers. I always tired to have my department clean, shop friendly, seasoned properly and of course sales ready. But when you clean up after people every day and are constantly informing the management team and then they get upset at you for bringing the issue up and or you aren't able to complete certain things when they want.. That pushes people away even quicker because they don't care to even help.",3,Former Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"London, OH",4/17/19,2019,4,17

I learn a lot but on my own but Wal-mart store 0931 is very unorganized they will ask you to do something and don't even show you half of the time I had to figure it out by myself.

Only worth it if you work as a cap associate,"If you do get a job there, just keep in mind you are responsible for keeping up on your tardies and absences even though they have a point system set up that is flawed. It seems to not consistently update so lets say you call in one day and youre on your last point but you have sick hours to cover it but for some reason the system hasnt updated a previous tardy/absence, then even if you use your sick hours thinking you will be safe their point system will eventually add that point you may have forgotten about since it didnt show up the last time you checked and you'll be automatically flagged for termination if you go over even by half a point. You have to constantly keep asking HR or the managers to make sure the system is accurate for your peace of mind. It wouldnt be that big of an issue if you didnt already have a huge workload that was expected to be done by the end of your shift and trying to always get a managers attention is a very time consuming process that, depending on who you are, may or may not work out for you. But like any job your experience there may vary. Just thought I'd point that out so someone else doesn't end up getting fired without notice even after putting in a lot of hard work.",3,Former Employee,Cap 1 Associate ,"Sanger, CA",4/16/19,2019,4,16

It was nice at first then it wasnt so nice.,"In 2013 when I first started the work was manageable, the managers were nice and fun to talk to, the employees were helpful to everyone. I gave them 6 years of my life. Two years later, after the old managers left and new management came, I was forced on to cap team 2, they didn't care if I wanted to be on the team or not. Gave us more work to do with not much time to work. I was coached more than one time for taking too long to down stack the grocery pallets, I was all by myself and there were more than 10 pallets stacked at least 7 or 8 feet tall. Previously, before I was on cap 2, 3rd shift would take care of things that my shift couldn't finish, but since they gave a $2 rasie (which is laughable) they expected me to break my back finishing all the the things 3rd was supposed to do. I'm not even sure what 3rd shift does anymore besides setting mods and complaining. Before I was terminated we got a new supervisors who would blame the team for everything, I would be taken to the office like 2 to 3 times a month for not respecting the idiots who I worked for because they didn't give respect. I can't just give respect to people who don't earn it, I wasn't raised that way. My coworkers were too afraid of losing their jobs to call anyone out. Their is a lot more to say about these new policies in place that make no sense, but I would be writing a book if I went in to it. Long story short crappie management, supervisors, and policies. Only apply if you know the managers won't bust your balls for doing your best.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Stocking ,"Anderson, SC",4/16/19,2019,4,16

"Every manager has their own way, not one best way","Get to the door managers already handing you keys, vendors already waiting at the receiving door. Changed shift to 4am even though reports still print at the same time if you came in at 5am. So juggle checking in vendors, remember to get reports done, take break when and if you can even take a break. Finish vendors if they all show up when they're supposed to. Take lunch, come back to ups/fed ex/yellow freight. Check in merchandise as fast as you can cause it's expected of you to finish your tasks but then wait on managers to actually come pick up their stuff if they even communicate or come back at all, but also can fall on you if expensive merchandise isn't picked up. Also have to make sure vendor bins are slotted and labeled correctly, oh yeah, and bin signing as well. Clear out memo's, do close out report.

Boring and physically demanding,"I swear the management here doesn't want you to have a home life at all. It honestly sucks working here. They make you work 9 hour shifts and try to compensate you with telling you it's because you get an hour unpaid lunch break. I don't want an hour lunch break.

"Set hours, set schedule, consistent routine","Pretty decent job If you enjoy moving around a lot, and multi-tasking. Schedule was always 2/3 weeks out, I enjoy the freedom to work on my own without being micromanaged. Hours were also set which was nice. _x000D__x000D_Some things that I don’t care for, first being the equipment we are required to use wasn’t up to par, if you did get a good scanner it was because you got there 30+ minutes early or you know someone who checks them out for you, it’s frustrating that a company as big as it is can’t provide employees with decent tools to do their own job. _x000D_Second, you never know who’s a manager, over what area, at what level? It’s confusing and I don’t enjoy being barked at by random management. Some of which I have never met, they don’t introduce themselves and have little respect  for employees under them. - as someone who has spent many years in management, I believe the attitude of the boss, sets the tone for the crew. Building moral and working with your team shows respect. I do however understand they are getting chewed out hourly in their radios, the pressure is on and if the crew isn’t working like they should, the boss gets it, not to mention the CAP supervisor is also expected to complete many tasks. This brings me too number 3, laziness. _x000D_I know it’s everywhere and it doesn’t matter what age. BUT if you are expected to complete 7 pallets and you have “ four people “ and 2 of those people constantly need bathroom breaks, lengthy smoke breaks, and just about anything to weasel away from freight, this makes YOU look bad.

This place is a joke.,Work ethics are backwards. No communication with management. Hardly any training. Plays favoritism. They don't post all job openings and fill by playing favoritism.

Overall,"Only worked there a short time. Although I did work for Wal-Mart more than once. I don't think I'll ever go back. I'd have to be desperate for a job. It's not the greatest.

Fast Pace and Very Rewarding,"As an employee of Walmart, I must say I really enjoyed working for this company.  Management provided a safe, face-paced work environment.  As a manager, I was able to learn many valuable skills such as time management,  communication to the customer and to my fellow associates.

Okay place to work if you’re not staying long,"I have worked here for 3 years and the CSS’s are always changing. They never schedule enough cashiers, and that makes it super stressful. The CSS’s on the night shift have WAY too much to handle, leaving them off of the front end and hard to reach when the customer service and cashier associates need them. And some of the CSS’s are rude. And it’s hard to request off lately and actually get it off, they say “not enough coverage”, like so schedule more people that day. That’s why we request off in advance, so there’s time to find coverage.",3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Owensboro, KY",4/15/19,2019,4,15
Not really a place for a full career,Well it was long hard hours for what really wasnt enough pay for how hard you really have to work however it was good money but you have to work in some really dirty and dusty conditions where you are confined in the back of a trailor of an 18 wheeler loading cases where the trailers are rarely ever cleaned before we had to go into them to work but it was work so it had to be done.,4,Former Employee,Shipping s-1 loader ,"Midway, TN",4/15/19,2019,4,15

I liked Walmart,Co-workers are great! The pay could be better but not bad. Management in my store never agreed on store policies. It was an average work pace which is good. The dress code is relaxed now that they let you work with any type of clothing as long as you wear the customer service vest. The hardest part of working for Walmart was the managers not agreeing on policies and making up policies on the spot. The best part about Walmart is you receive a 10% discount on taxable items.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Lancaster, PA",4/15/19,2019,4,15

Not a lot of people liked our assistant manager, our department manager was a swell guy. the lower management, the supervisors, where the best part of the job because they made you feel like you were apart of a team and family. The Wal-mart way was to make sure the customers left satisfied and smiling which in most cases we did. Wal-mart over achieved by making me leave the same way.

I learned quite a few things in there; some good and some bad. I never liked how the management switched up,because that’s when. Things changed and favoritism came around. Me personally mind my own business and kept myself at a fast steady paste. I joke with others but I never like slacking. I help my former workers every night because I never like being behind on anything, or being told why this or that hasn’t been done knowing it wasn’t my part to do. As a maintenance if one falls we all go down. Which was understandable,but that’s why I would seek to help my fellow employees so that wouldn’t happen. Not all the time it work, because our supervisor would just walk around doing I don’t what. I just kept myself busy and away from most people because I like to be about my job.

I give Walmart a 8-10 rating in terms of being a solid living job,A typical day in Walmart for me would be for me to come in and clock in.

I learned how to do many different things especially how to not tire my body out when repeatedly lifting items. Walmart has had one of if not the best working atmosphere that I've ever worked in and I wouldn't mind going back.

Managers pick favorites and nasty customers,"Managers like to pick favorites, which makes movement within the store a living nightmare, and it makes the turn over rate much higher than it should.

If you are a workaholic, Walmart does not hardly ever offer over time, the hours i was scheduled to work put me between 32-37 hours a week usually working 5 days a week. Some days i was only scheduled to work 5-6 hours, and rarely ever do you have weekends off. Customer service is key at Walmart.

It’s not that great..,"July will make three years for me being at Walmart as a front end cashier. This job is easy except for when it comes to dealing with the different attitudes and personalities in customers. Customers have never really been my issue, more so management. Walmart is definitely one of those places that managers walk around as if they are better than anyone else. My main reason for wanting to leave is how horrible they are with availability. I’m in school so every semester my availability usually has to change. I don’t like how long it takes for it to come into effect. It takes three weeks for that next availability to come start which is too long, then I have to worry about points and getting them erased and all that, it’s just too big of a hassle.

Overall Not Bad,"Overall this call center is a nice place to work because its easy and the pay is okay for the position. If you want to move up you are able to get there. They run off the idea that ""perception is reality"" which isn't ideal if people in high places didn't bother to get to know who you are. The hardest part of the job is that you have to deal with de-escalation which means screaming, angry, entitled, and vile customers.There are great customers too but again the department is de-escalations. If you can do that day in and out then great. They provide you de-escalation tools and tips to get through it and the main one is to not take it personal. Pretty easy right? Workplace culture is good overall, although you can tell the disconnect between management and leads. No working harmony overall. A few people in management seem disgruntled.  If you want to come in do your job  and go home, then this place works for you. If you want to move up then good luck and be careful. Not a lot of schedule flexibility, barely any. Change happens too often.",4,Current Employee,Customer Resolutions Team ,"Fort Worth, TX",4/14/19,2019,4,14

Wouldn't recommend it but it pays the bills,Starting at Walmart is fun at first until you realize they expect too much like wanting you to stay late but not wanting to let you keep your overtime plus they put many workers in positions they don't belong such as senior citizens helping on semis etc other than the decent pay it's not that great of a job in my opinion their very inconsiderate,2,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Tarpon Springs, FL",4/14/19,2019,4,14

one bad apple,I enjoyed what I did and was considered the one to go to if someone had any questions. I knew how everything was supposed to be and did everything I could to keep it in shape.

A good place to work,"In my experience with Wal-Mart, working for them was overall good. They work with you and your schedule but sometime it might cost you hours on your paycheck. In my specific position (Asset protection) I found it difficult to move up the ladder because of lack of availability for the position above me. My advice is to start your employment as a sales associate on the floor. There is a lot more room to move on the sales side of Wal-Mart than it is on the Asset Protection side. I felt like the benefits lacked a little and If you’re expecting holidays off then I would find somewhere else to work as they only give you Christmas Day off and even on that day it’s not paid. They cover Christmas Day with your own paid time off. They don’t offer holiday pay either.

I guess it’s okay,"The only reason I got this job is because I didn’t plan on staying more than a year and I haven’t yet but I might decide to.

I like how I’ve made a lot of new friends at Walmart so that helps pass the time. _x000D_Just be aware that if you’re a cashier you do A LOT. You zone, sometimes work at self checkout, do returns (put stuff back on the shelves), and if they have no one then you also bring in carts which I’ve dont several times. _x000D_I guess overall I like the job because for some reason I like bagging.

social place to work,at Walmart you are able to socialize and get to know the community you serve as a lot of customers are repeat customers.

Awful place to work,Terrible place to work. Management is awful and treat their employees terribly. Customers treat you however they feel like and you get cussed out and degraded on a daily basis and management allows it. They drill the policies into your head but then they don’t follow them and make you look dumb in front of customers. If the customers throw a big enough fit they can do whatever they want.

Stressful understaffed; Comradery via Suffering,"I only worked in one section of the store the Deli. However, it was constantly understaffed. There would usually only be two people to run the whole Deli. And when lunches and breaks came by there would be only one. This often led to reductions in proper rotation times of hot food items and slow customer service at the counter. Creating an environment that was very fast paced and stressful, as the threat of a reprimand or punishment if the regional inspector paid a surprise visit constantly loomed over you. The managers were great and understanding and most co-workers got along. There was a comradery from this deluge of stress, traumatic bonding caused by it. Closing was equally the best and worst part. Because there were no customers one could take their time. However, one still felt the need to rush so as to not get reprimanded for getting too much overtime. But with the previously stated understaffing those who closed often had to cover what people previously in the day should have done themselves. Extra dishes, garbage, ect.

Horrible Company to work for,Walmart is a horrible company to work for the managers treat you like your nothing!!! Your hired for a position but you barely get a chance to work in your department you’ll be unloading trucks working outside in the garden center on the register pretty much doing whatever it is they tell you to do. Your first 3 days will be great all the managers will seem friendly by day 4 the friendliness ends they’ll no longer speak when they see you and then comes the picking on you as if your going through a hazing that never ends. The customers aren’t the problem it’s the managers. Oh don’t believe the hype about the wonderful 401k plan it’s taxed so you’ll never get your full amount and if your looking for health benefits they don’t offer them but they’ll tell you they do but you’ll have to be full time which they’ll tell you you are but your really part time in their system.

Terribly managed during holidays with no incentive for new employees to stay,"The unloading area was small and cramped with all of the people moving things nonstop.

How to set modulars, how to work the deli, the proper way of putting items in the bins in the back amongst various other smaller things. The management where I work is fantastic they will listen to you and will teach you what you desire to learn in order for you to try and move up the chain of command if you desire.

The management were very patient and helped me with my learning process as well as being supportive. There was a dress-code which wasn't half bad also they would make you feel special on your birthday and were as well sensitive to their employees, like if you needed a day off due to certain reasons.Well the hardest part of my job i would say is the fear of people not understanding my accent sometimes but i was able to work around that to make myself more audible and understood despite my accent.

Worst place to work,"Learned a lot about price changes ,mods, costumer service from my peers. They don't train you it's all learned through a software .when asking for help from management they say look it up.when you're behind on work they also do not give help even though other departments that are more important to them get most of the help. Favoritism is huge and very obvious. High turn over rate and or assistant managers and department managers leaving Walmart all together. Co manager is very rude and disregards people's feelings.

Awful,"I worked at Walmart for just over 7 years in 3 different positions all of them hourly, I wouldn't say any of them were promotions. Over my 7 years there I had several managers who were good, but most are pretty awful. I stuck with the company because I kept getting promises of interviews for management positions without ever receiving an interview over 7 years. Walmart will continually just promote favorites and yes men/women. They don't like people who critically think or question how things are done. Even if the questioning is done in a respectful manner. On two separate occasions I was overlooked for a promotion and then I was the one responsible for training the person who would then be my manager. Also they don't work with their associates at all when it comes to scheduling. In my 7 years there I never once had a set schedule. I will say the benefits were decent but they pay was awful for the stuff they require you to do for them.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Utica, NY 13502",4/8/19,2019,4,8

He guaranteed me they would as that was something guaranteed at the corporate level. Worked through the summer no issues, gave them my school availability when it started, was fine for a couple weeks then out of no where they start scheduling me a couple days then I'm off for up to 11 days in a row at points, then when I'm due back it's during my unavailable days/hours when I'm supposed to be in class. They kept doing it and I couldn't afford to work there like that and they weren't happy with me calling off even if I had told them multiple times that I can't work those times/days.

They go by 1box = 1 minute which even now you can imagine makes no sense at all. a box of 25 candles is going to take longer to stock then a box filled with 2 gallons of tea, yet the management who seemly never worked as a stocker would refuse to listen to anyone working the floor and get straight up angry if you asked for assistance if their system said your area should have only taken 5 hours. This isn't just 1 manager either, I believe there were a total of 3 or 4 that would rotate, some being better then others of course. But even the department managers were often ridiculous with their requests, expecting straight up miracles to happen on a daily basis and getting angry when what they wanted wasn't done. _x000D__x000D_(This happened MORE THAN ONCE but here's an example)_x000D_I worked 3rd shift and I once remember I stopped stocking shelves because 2 customers had asked me about some fishing glow stick things. I had gone over to the spot they were and was looking for them when at that moment a manger had come over and saw I wasn't stocking. He actually pulled me away from the customer (Not physically but refused to let me help them until I'd walk over) and while the 2 customers stood 5 feet behind me, in ear shot, asked me why I wasn't working.

Very fast paced for super Wal-Marts,"A typical day at WalMart as a CSM consisted of supervising the getting on a register when the lines were long at the service desk and cash registers. Checking the parking lot every 20-30 minutes to see if cart corrals were full or blocking traffic, communicating to cart attendants and delegating help for the parking lot when needed. Management is a hit or miss depending on the manager or the store. Workplace has great HR. Hardest part of being a CSM is communication between peers and multitasking as you will be needed in a multitude of places at the same time if you are understaffed and it's a busy time or store. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out your staff and customers.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Grapevine, TX",4/6/19,2019,4,6

Very loose management except when you don't do more than expected,"Walmart was my first job, and it wasn't the best experience. Management gossiped about employees to the point that I didn't trust any of them, Let alone hope to advance my position. Not 2 weeks after being asked to go full time I was fired because I had 3 points (the point system is absolutely ridiculous) which was due to missing work after beginning to have anxiety and panic attacks.

Corperate Monsters,"I worked for both the Wal-Mart store and the D.C. the store is ran by a tyrant ironically named happy, who makes up his own rules which make others suffer. The overall management there are awful people more worried about their bonus. The D.C. is just as awful if not worse, the management was the biggest joke I've ever seen in a work place. Other than folding stickers and treating employees horribly, its hard to say exactly what they do there. At the store on average you work a 9 hour day with a your lunch, at the D.C. shifts are minimum 10 hours to 12 hours with a 30 minute lunch which makes no sense. Working for Wal-Mart means you're their slave. They will force you to put your personal life and family 2nd.",1,Former Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Billings, MT",4/6/19,2019,4,6

"Horrible management, doesn’t take employee issues seriously","I recently left Walmart. March 29th was my one year. And as crazy as it may sound my manager has it out for me and I have no idea why. I worked my butt off, did the job of about three people some times even had to do things the manager was suppose to take care of but was no where to be found. Walmart is the type of company that if your aren’t friends with the right people you will get no where. They called me and only me every time someone called out, had me in the bakery some days and even had me unloading trucks and bringing our items to our freezer in the deli and stock them. There were days I loved my job but after about 6 months I finally realized it doesn’t matter how hard you work it’s all about favoritism. I have a whole list of problems and situations that I had taken to my supervisor, then my assistant then finally the store manager and in the end Nothing was done about anything. Even being called racial slurs by another employee and she had nothing done. I had 5 statements against her from people and nothing was done. So if you want to work somewhere and work your tail off for no recognition then Walmart is the place for you. Just hope you be friend the right ones.",1,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Rocky Mount, VA",4/6/19,2019,4,6

Extremely bad place to work,"I have been employed at Walmart for 2 years as a FT employee. The rate of pay is high yet they barely give you hours. If your part time you might get 15-20 hours a week. If your FT you'll get 25-30; maybe 33 a week. Their is no set schedule so you have no life. New point system allows you 5 points per year before termination. Doctor's notes, accident's, death in family are all counted as an absence and will get you a point unless you use a PTO (Paid Time Off). Late to work is half point. No paid holidays or overtime either. While at work you have your department tasks you must complete (freight, price changes, customers, zone merchandise) plus you have support managers telling you to go into other areas of the store and do other people's work as well. Not to mention Assistant Manager's telling you to do other random things to. All while trying to do your tasks and take care of the customer. Very very stressful. If you don't complete the tasks or say anything wrong to management you are coached. _x000D_Management is CONSTANTLY changing policies on a day to day basis and even on a customer basis. They make you look like an idiot in front of the customer for following the policies. _x000D_This is by far the most stressful, most showing of favoritism, harassment, lack of communication, extremely horrible bad management company I have ever worked for.

When u call the HR to address the problem they tell you to speak to your store manager which is the same person who says that Home office is in control of raise and stuff. Not only that every manager is quick to try to ride you even if they just seen you do all your work. They treat lower co-workers like peonies unless your a kiss up.

Walmart Needs Help,"Sam Walton would be rolling in his grave if he knew what was really happening to his employees in his stores. While, I love to work with customers and people everyday at Walmart there is no such thing as a typical day. You learn on the fly and if you make a mistake, regardless of your lack in training you will be held accountable and maybe even threatened to be fired. The workplace culture is diverse and that is great, however, managers do not always see diversity as innovation and it's really management's way or the highway. The hardest part about the job was it was very ""clicky"", meaning you either fit in or you didn't and everyone would ask you to join their, ""don't like that person club"". It was very hard to give opportunities and work with staff because if you tried than others would hold it against you. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and working with so many unique personalities that were not given a title. I was a manager and I watched them fire people without cause, but the one time I stood up for that, I was brought into an ""integration room"" never to speak up again. I was very glad to leave. My reason given was based on balancing work and life, but really it's based on integrity and morality with other managers in the business. They hire people that do not want to help others.",2,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,Illinois,4/5/19,2019,4,5

Started out as exciting and ended up as subpar,"At first, the position of Fresh Cap 1 Associate was exciting and new. Learning a newly created job seemed like a really good opportunity for advancement. However with all new things, it quickly lost its ""shine"". When the position was first created, the company randomly chose associates from surrounding fresh department to converge and transfer to this new job title. Some associates had never done this type of work before. Most of us had come from production and were used to doing tasks such as cooking or making salads. Being pushed into this new position by no choice of our own was a little unfair. It was either transfer to Fresh Cap or leave the company. I was excited to leave the production team and start something new. Unfortunately, there was little to no help from upper management. Between the first week we started and the week I actually left the company, they added 6 new jobs to our already stressful position, with no additional employees. Most recently they added the task of monthly inventory to our duties, again with no additional employees to assist.",2,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 1 Associate ,"Omaha, NE",4/5/19,2019,4,5

I rarely had more than anyone but myself working which was a challenge in the deli as there should be at least two or more people back there.

A great place to gain hours,"Walmart is a fast-paced environment and always busy. No matter what department you're in, there is always something to do.

And their poi t system sucks! You get points for important things that you may have to do that just happens to land on a work day like Dr appointments, if you call in with the Flu they don't care they want you to come to work anyways and give it others and if you do and have to go home because your not feeling great you get a point depending on what time of the day you leave.if you leave 3 hours into your shift that's a whole point if you leave to hours before your shift ends that's a half a point really selfish rule",1,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Kansas City, MO",4/4/19,2019,4,4

Not the best environment,Working as Walmart can be very stressful. They are always understaffed which makes it hard to do your job. Managers are always stressing that certain jobs get done but there isn’t enough time in the day nor enough people to get everything done and done right. There are many days (almost every time I come in) that I have to hurry through the entire department trying to do everything that is asked of me. Communication is also really bad there. _x000D__x000D_The a plus I can offer is my department managers. They are always willing to help you when you are trying to figure stuff out.

Terrible management.,"I am going to start from the top of the list and work my way down so, day typically started out with us having our daily meeting to get yelled at for not doing enough the night before after the other shifts couldn't complete their jobs and we had to pick up the slack to do ours and theirs. _x000D_I learned no matter how hard you work it is never good enough and if you are a good worker and can get 8 hours of work done in 4 hours they'll expect you to do that every single night while others don't even get their 4 hours of work done. _x000D_Management was a complete and utter joke. Not being able to schedule enough people for the really busy days and not holding people accountable when they don't do their jobs day in and day out._x000D_Hardest part of the job was honestly putting up with lazy people.

Tons of options but losing family focus.,"Walmart is a great place to start out at and has tons of transfer and advancement available, however as it stands the company feels likes its heading in a direction where working there and having a family at home are at odds with one another as the focus is being pushed to second shift (2-11)",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Pittsfield, MA",4/4/19,2019,4,4

Loved My Job,"Im overall experience was great! The experience and knowledge i gained working for walmart is unmatched. Of course there are things and people I didn't like and didn't agree with, but what job doesn't? In terms of Walmart your experience will be different as an employee depending on the position you apply for, the location of the store, and who YOU are as a person. I have visited many stores and every store is different the employee connection within the store. Walmart is way more than a store that sells goods and services they are so much more. _x000D_Ex: They have there own construction workers  so if construction or carpentry is your skill or interest then do the reasearch and make it happen.

Company as a whole was okay. Management was terrible,The guy in HR was wonderful. The online training was good. I worked in the pharmacy. The manger treated the techs like they were beneath her. She talked non stop about her lavish lifestyle and expected us to listen then got upset if anyone fell behind. She was a lazy drill sergeant. Her manager never acknowledged the techs. It was like we were dogs to him. Techs couldn't even drink water in pharmacy but the pharmacist could have a five course meal if they wanted bc they were always catered too by the company.

Walmart is a learning experience.,"I love my coworkers and my job for the most part.

poor workplace,Management is inconsistent. A culture of hostility and resentment exists. The pay is not good and raises are overlooked and not given because cost of living increases were given. That has created a feeling of not being appreciated as employees. Management illegally keeps hourly associates after their shifts are over without their consent. The list goes on but the point has been shown.,3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,Troy NY,4/4/19,2019,4,4

Stressful work that should only be temporary if possible.,"A typical day would normally start with trying to do everything that the previous shift failed to complete while also weaving in one's own tasks for the day. The management above you is either kind or apathetic. The hardest part of the job is trying to please your customers and associates when they need your assistance and failing. For no matter how hard you try, there will always be a rude, hateful person who will twist your words and intentions. The most enjoyable part is actually hearing a thank-you from someone who needed your help, regardless of the outcome.",4,Former Employee,Department Manager/Sales Associate ,"Skiatook, OK",4/4/19,2019,4,4
bad work place,The deli was a cut throat place to work.  Everyone would watch everyone else and try to get them in trouble.

Too much for too little,"This place is more for high schoolers or just people trying to build a job resume not really a career thing unless you already put in the time and by time I mean 15-20 years. I worked they for a year and some change and on had a $1 raise. Sad part people that got hired  and was only on for a day up to a few months had my same pay rate, I got paid like a new hire. Not really any growth unless it was in your own store. They never wanted to give you hours. They were willing to cut off one minute just to save money and when I started I was only a part-time cashier making $8.40. They only wanted me to work 32 hrs not 32.01.

Good starting out job to gain experience,I worked for Walmart right after graduating from high school then continued to work there for several years. After sometime working in different areas I ended up in the vision center. I ended up loving it. They provided good training and incentives to get licenses. I now have a career as a licensed dispensing optician making a livable wage. (No longer at walmart) And Walmart is the reason I got here. I didnt always agree with the policies or agree with decision made by management but overall I dont regret working there. I've heard the benefits and pay have gotten worse since I've left and they are constantly eliminating positions so it feels like there is no job security but if you can get into the vision center or pharmacy you are better off. The store manager plays a huge role in overall store moral and I was lucky to have a caring manager while I was there.,3,Former Employee,Optician ,"Arlington, WA",4/4/19,2019,4,4

It is extremely satisfying to work for a company that prides itself on bettering the investment universe and not becoming complacent. I work with a lot of bright people that also have a solid moral foundation—doing right by clients. I’ve worked elsewhere and attest there is a big difference working at Fisher in a good way.

Intense labor,"At the time, I enjoyed the pace and intensity of the job because it kept me healthy and in shape.

Especially on Black Friday, or any holiday, they would throw me on the registers, because they know that I work fast and understood how to do my job well. The hardest part of being a cashier is probably catching up with new rules. For example, they made a rule that we can no longer give out change, a certain coupon cannot be used or maybe a price of an item is lower than it is on the computer, etc. I enjoy working with people and just meeting new staffs.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Eau Claire, WI",4/2/19,2019,4,2

Very Stressful and No Consistency Among Management-- DO NOT work here if you want a good job!,"Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have worked for Walmart to begin with. The store I worked at has very poor management overall, from the front end CSMS (who I interacted with more daily) to the ASMS (who claim they're working daily but are nowhere to be seen when needed). Management doesn't back its employees AT ALL and will quickly throw valuable employees under the bus and tell flat out lies to upper management rather than take responsibilities for their own actions. A lot of ASMS get their job the good old-fashioned way and are very young and inexperienced and yet expect you to respect them when they don't give or show it._x000D__x000D_They will unfairly demote you from your position to a position that you're physically unable to perform due to medical restrictions and certain ASMS are very condescending when talking to you, which is very unprofessional.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Money Center ,"Phoenix, AZ",4/1/19,2019,4,1

i liked walmart just not the bakery,"normally all I did was out away truck decorate cupcakes and help stock the floor. although I knew how to do all 4 sections in the bakery. the hardest part was working in the bakery because my mom has passed away a couple months prior and she use to be the manager of the deli so work was a constant reminder of her. I asked to be moved but was basically told I would be stuck there. I liked Walmart a lot just not the area I was in, the manager over there was a grown women who acted as a 16 year old.

Stepping Stone,Honestly it just depends on where you work at Walmart for how it will be . At times it can be a wonderful rewarding job and others it can be horrible and stressful.

Review Of Walmart,Stocking the department overnight and cleaning up once i am done. How to bend with your knees and not your back.

The job is made harder by others,"Typically come in and stock freight that was left over by previous shifts due to poor management of associates. Management would typically give more favor to the departments they were over instead of thinking about the store as a whole and would pull team away from our normal processes. Several times would have hours cut only for management to turn around and expect the normal amount of work to get done in less time or try to offer ""overtime"" instead of just scheduling the team the normal hours.",3,Former Employee,CAP 1 Associate ,"Baytown, TX",4/1/19,2019,4,1

Needs more work,Walmart has always been a company that never been about the workers. After working there for almost two years there is more they need to improve.

Not good,"Did not get along with the managers due to different beliefs. I struggled to feel welcomed and accepted for who I am.

Great place but kinda disappointing with certain rules,I loved working there at Walmart . My supervisor was just extremely disrespectful but I’d brush it off and get my job done.

Okay first job.,Good place to start working however it is not a job to make a career out of. Constantly changing programs for workers to do their job which usually results in poorer performance and less productivity.

"Expected to provide ""clinical services""","I really enjoy the type of work and my coworkers. Corporate can be very demanding when they come, which fortunately isn't that often. What really makes me angry is that Walmart is phasing in new job duties for pharmacy technicians which include blood testing and eventually giving vaccinations. I never wanted to do this kind of work as I have a fear of blood. However I like my job enough that I will stay until I get fired. If this happens, I plan on filing charges of discrimination on the basis of a disability.",3,Current Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Hutchinson, MN",4/1/19,2019,4,1
Take take take,"Every couple months, upper management comes forward with something else they are taking from the employees.

"walmart was a fun place to work, until recently",Walmart has begun to try and automate as much as they can now.  They are cutting higher paid positions left and right in an attempt to save money.  There is not much room for growth in the company anymore and the higher up positions are being eliminated quickly.  Fairly soon entry level jobs will be where the bulk of the work will come from with increased responsibilities from the entry level workers without increased compensation.  I used to recommend Walmart to everyone i knew but not anymore.,2,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Punxsutawney, PA",4/1/19,2019,4,1

"Good pay, nice workers, high expectations",When I started with Walmart the pay was good and the management was well organized and understanding.  When I started changing stores I realized the that management set the tone for each store and some were not managed as  well.  The culture was uncomfortable and more stressful.  I also realized that as I aged some store were not as accepting of disabilities.,4,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Prairie du Chien, WI",4/1/19,2019,4,1
Productive and excellent workplace,"Typically I would be working as a cashier almost every day I came into work but there was few exception.

"Work is stressful, but the people are great",The hardest part about the job is going in everyday and picking up the slack of the 2 shifts before. I loved working there.

Very lazy people. Managers don't like to help doneness,Hard to work with people that don't want to do what their job consists of.

Everyone for themselves,"Everyone is only out for themselves at my Walmart, and are all too willing to throw new associates under the bus should the opportunity to arise. Most of the managers stay in the office rather than help where they can or stand around talking. Not too many friendly faces. If a manager has an issue with your job performance, they are more likely to complain to someone else and have that person tell you. _x000D__x000D_Fairly simple job: zone, put away re-shops, and help customers. I didn't mind the job aside from management. The customers were overall friendly and thankful for any assistance (it was my impression a majority of my fellow associates weren't very helpful or smiled). A few associates in and outside my department were kind.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Albany, NY",4/1/19,2019,4,1
It’s a good first job!,"I wouldn’t recommend staying in a certain position for too long.

Bad place to work,Too much favoritism there some people can do anything they want like talking on their phone and not working and never get in trouble but others that work hard get treated like dirt .,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Beaumont, TX",4/1/19,2019,4,1
stressful and the higher up the more your assistant managers blame you for their shortcomings,definitely not worth the 13.50 to run like a chicken with its head cut off. They will continue to add more work for you even if it is not part of your contract. Be careful not to call out too many times even if you have paid Sick time off. The assistant Managers will text you for not showing up to work. Always trying to cut hours and the CSS's and Cashiers take the fall for it. Not the greatest place to work at. If someone harasses you and you file a formal complaint get ready for management to talk to the person you filled the report and have them disregard any basic sense of confidentiality,2,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Tucson, AZ",4/1/19,2019,4,1
Typical Day at Grovetown Walmart,It was always busy. Customers were always rude even if you tried everything to make them proud. I learned how to control my temper when talking to the customers.,5,Former Employee,Apparel Sales Associate ,"Grovetown, GA",4/1/19,2019,4,1
I actually am rehirable there. Have applied but received no answer.,The pay was great. Loved the hours and discount. The management was one of the biggest issues about this job.

The female manager demanded to come in private examing room which i felt it was a violation of my right to privacy.,3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Idaho Falls, ID",4/1/19,2019,4,1
Fun place to work,The only thing I didn’t like about this job is that only a handful of my teammates seemed to take the job seriously. Management will get pretty desperate and keep on lazy employees just to have warm bodies on the floor. There was always a constant battle between morning and day crew accusing each other of not doing their job correctly. The pay  and the hours were good though.,4,Former Employee,Fresh CAP Associate ,"Post Falls, ID",3/31/19,2019,3,31

Too many chiefs not enough Indians to fo work properly.,Very stressful never got breaks on time some managers were rude. Never knew of I have as going to work more hours or not.

Slave drivers,"Associates are worked like dogs. I watched Managers write up associates to keep themselves out of trouble. I had to leave because I was trained well, but the stores do not implement their own training. Integrity was a issue. Managers who are office rats, and suck ups tend to succeed.  Not a team I was proud to be a part of.",1,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Ohio,3/31/19,2019,3,31
Horrible.,"The favoritism is out of hand and dont even get me started with the horrible hours and the stupid minor rules. 18 and still in school but can work all day because all of your classes are online? Nope, you're still a minor. Enjoy your 15 hours a week. CSM's are never anywhere to be found because they are so close with the managers and can get away with doing absolutely nothing. Have 4 absences and have bills? Guess what? No hours for you. I love my coworkers but I cannot deal with management. Wal-Mart is an awful company and I absolutely do not recommend working here unless you're interested in kissing butt.",1,Current Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Goldsboro, NC",3/31/19,2019,3,31
Exhausting Clique Culture,"A typical day at work consists of micromanaged tasks and consistently being asked to drop what you're doing to complete surprise priority tasks. The original tasks assigned aren't completed but employees are still held responsible for them even when completely following orders given by management. Management often denies their poor leadership by manipulating interpretation of their direction, and scapegoating employees for their failure to adhere to company processes.The culture at this establishment is that of a high school, professional only to it's customers but extremely snide among employees and management, divided into groups based on partiality. The hardest part of the job is obtaining the equipment and supplies needed to complete tasks. Management often denies requests of need, but always comes through for it's favorites, leaving the rest of us to come up with tedious and unorthodox methods to get the job done. Favorites don't believe that their colleagues are treated differently, and insist that any hardship must be due to work ethic.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Lumberton, NJ",3/31/19,2019,3,31

"Walmart 1559: abusive management, no regular schedules, always crowded, bad area.","If you're looking to just pay for basics or even a 2nd job, look somewhere else! There are plenty of other retail jobs in this city that will treat you better for the same pay. This store & most others in the metro area will make you job unhappy. Don't be tricked by the $11 hr. starting pay, you'll rarely get 40 hours a week, so you'll really get close to $9 hr. Low morale caused by abusive salaried management, your schedule changes every week, management won't be sympathetic to your concerns, only certain long term associates & favorites get regular days off, day shift associates that don't have open availability 7 days a week from 6am-1am will get their hours cut and even entire days cut. Cashiers frequently have to go outside to push carts when there aren't enough cart pushers on shift, tough when its very hot outside. This store isn't a super center, aisles/backrooms are cluttered with merchandise causing customers & associates to always bump in to each other, puts everyone in a bad mood. If you work on the sales floor, there's lots of manual labor & usually no team work in most depts. Management will frequently want you to stop a task in the middle- to do something else, then threaten to discipline you for not finishing the 1st task on time. Many of the  customers are nasty/mean and mess up the store daily, makes zoning in most depts, especially Apparel, impossible. Store is in a bad area, parking lot has common car theft, assaults.

Worse place to work at,"I worked at Walmart for almost 2 years and it was the most stressful, unfair working conditions of an employment I've ever had. The management is nothing but a joke only caring about receiving there quarterly and yearly bonuses with could result in a full year of salary. Associates are treated unfairly to only serve the management needs many associates were making decisions in regards to customers issues because management was nowhere to be found. Also management would falsify documents and do whatever it took to cover there own mistakes and punish hard working associates. _x000D__x000D_Walmart is not a good place to work for they classify all associates as part time employee's so Walmart doesn't have to offer any benefits to them. Walmart would work you close to 40 hours a week for 3 weeks and come the 4th week you'd be lucky to get 10 hours so they can bypass laws of giving you full time status and benefits. Also if you're a student and have classes Walmart doesn't care about you furthering there education they have purposely terminated or have forced hard working associates to resign from there positions because there education schedule interfered with there schedule.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Simi Valley, CA",3/31/19,2019,3,31

Not a place that cares about employees,"Walmart is not a place you want to work if you get sick or have kids. They don't care about you or your family or even try and work with you to get on another shift if the current shift isn't working out. During the my time there I have seen countless employees come and go (such as myself). Management plays favoritism and doesn't do their jobs properly. I would never recommend anyone to work for store #771. Every store is different, but all the employee's (both current and former) I've spoken with all say the same thing, every since the original owner Sam Walton died everything went down the drain. I'm sure Walmart was once a company people loved to work for, now it is not like that at all. They work you to death and management wants you to go above and beyond for them like we are slaves. What I've learned from working at Walmart is NEVER be afraid to call corporate if you feel something is seriously not right, and if your own store's manager is not doing their job, GO TO THE PERSON ABOVE THEM - ESP IF IT IS A VALID REASON. Workplace culture is quite fun actually, if you don't think about management.",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Merritt Island, FL",3/30/19,2019,3,30

Don't ever give them 100%.,"Walmart trains its employees to stop working hard because no matter how hard one works, one will never get a leg up or catch a break. The only way you will manage to get ahead at Walmart is by tattling on your fellow employees or kissing up to your superiors. Hard work gets you absolutely NO WHERE. Also management is pathetic. There are so many people in charge of you and guess what? None of them communicate with each other. They also have a tendency to disagree with each other which makes it incredibly difficult to accomplish anything because you're just redoing things constantly, which is a complete waste of company time.The most difficult part of my job is the total lack of respect and common decency from my superiors. I don't deserve to be treated like an idiot and I definitely don't deserve to be given the run around when it comes to my hours. If I had to say there was an enjoyable part, it would be the moments when me and my coworkers have accomplished the tasks for the day while also laughing and having a good time because no where on One Best Way does it say I HAVE to be miserable.

Walmart drains the life out of you,"Working at Walmart is not fulfilling. Everyone told me not to apply, but I didn't believe them. The pay is worth it sometimes.

My experience,"So every store is different.  As with any job its what you put into it that determines the outcome.  I like working for wal-mart for the most part. Anyone with any job that says they cant find anything about what ever job or company they work for either isn't pushing themselves past their max or is brain washed or they don't care.  My personal situation is that I do care about my performance and what I can accomplish.  Working for a company that is extremely teamed based its hard to stay competitive when the bar some of the people you work with are setting are still laying on the ground.  Its hard to motivate and push some of those people when they are constantly being built up with praises on how great they are.  Its like you know when you was a kid and you come home from school and clean up the entire house and your little brother comes home and does nothing but put 1 shoe in his room and leaves the other in the middle of the floor and your mom comes home and praises him how great he did trying to get them in his room, but doesn't even acknowledge what you did. Its kind of like that at times.  However, took me a long time to realize with my job at walmart I need to stop waiting for the praise for what I accomplish.  I just need to be proud I can say I did my best that I could and have honesty behind it.  So in review walmart can be extremely rewarding with the family you will gain, the people and customers that will teach you things and that you will get to help in some way in and out of the store even if you never realize it.  Some of them may be positive and some of them - more...",4,Current Employee,Crew Member ,Missouri,3/29/19,2019,3,29

"a great place to grow, a horrible place to work","where should i start?_x000D__x000D_training was typically abysmal, usually consisting of maybe 5-10 minutes of overview, and sending you to the wolves. They have lots of computer based training, but they are usually for safety purposes, or are simply PR campaigns disguised as training (Walmart does not like unions, and they will tell you as much....often). The most training i ever received was in 2 scenarios: the first was for a job that wasnt even mine, i was simply filling in because they didn't have enough people (a common problem, that has only gotten worse as time has gone by) and the second was for a position that was brand new for our store (so i can understand why that training was so in depth)._x000D__x000D_Management was almost comically inept at times. Typical higher up managers (co managers and store managers) are basically all ego, and they typically either do not know what goes into the things they tell people to do, or they just ignore it because they do know...but they just want things to work out without using the required resources or time. Not all managers are this way thankfully, but the few that are like this seem to be the ones that make it to co manager/store manager level (also some assistant managers have given my life more stress than is needed). I've had multiple managers tell me to do things that i was promptly written up for within the next few days (sometimes by the same manager), because they were things that were directly against policy, and they know this.

Customer Service Cashier,A typical day at work i walk in clock in and go the front end and load my bags on my register and get my jur and count it. I learned with an Employee how to do the lbs/ amount and enter give you the right total of lbs when counting fruits or vegtables by lbs. The Management here is great there always there when you need them. The work place is mostly cleaned all day and organized. The hardest part of the job is Customer Service you can not make all customers happy but you can always try withba Smile. My Enjoyable moment of the job for me is when my Customers ask for me by my name and if im not there they will leave and come back and say hi and ask how i am they made me feel like family and that is what made me come to work. I would work here if you have patiance to work with the public and others and can do Customer Service. I did my job to the fulliest and got Rewarded by the Ceo of Walmart for all my hard work i did as a great Cashier for Walmart for 5 years i reccomened this job anytime. I also helped customers online to do orders sent to their home and got alot of buttons for my jacket at Walmart to show my apprication to help cuatomers at all times where evervi am in that store. Just Remember when a customer needs help and so does another one at the same time help the first one and then tell the other customer nicely ill be right with you when im done with them okey Thank you for waiting.  Just treat a customer like you would treat your family.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Norwalk, CA",3/29/19,2019,3,29

"Relaxed work environment, strict management, and overall stressful.",I personally loved working as a Cap 2 Associate. I loved unloading the trucks and being on the line. I loved the work crew I had. We all worked well together and got our work done. We enjoyed being a part of a team. Stocking the shelves and being on the floor helping customers was one of my favorite job duties. I loved meeting new people that came into the store and needed help. I loved working in the infants department. That became my department where I was most comfortable and did my best work.,4,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Gardner, MA",3/29/19,2019,3,29

I left to start my own company,"With the limited upward mobility, toxic managment, and grade school bikering it made the most sense for me to go into business for myself. I don't have to worry about a manager that has to prove he knows more. I actually think the one best way was an amazing implementation, I just think they have to roll through the old guard to get adequate results. The bickering, and rumor mill, while policy is in place to prevent it, it is rarely enforced. Though they will hire just about anyone, and they don't drug test until you get to Management, or have to drive specialized equiptment... and it shows.",4,Former Employee,Frozen/ Dairy Department Manager/ Bakery Team Lead ,"Amarillo, TX",3/29/19,2019,3,29

Your Store is What you Make It,"I worked many many positions at Walmart regardless of if that was my job title or not. You will last a long time and move up quickly if you are willing to do more than what is asked of you and if you volunteer to work over your shift or cover shifts. I loved working for my first store, but when I had to move and transfer stores that is when I left the company. The other store was just unreasonable. I did not like the management like I did at my first store. They did not work with my schedule like they did at my first store. So I would say ultimately I think it just comes down to your perception of your store and what you are willing to do to move up.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Little Rock, AR",3/29/19,2019,3,29

"Good place for experience, sometimes toxic workplace","A typical day at work is very easy as a cashier.

Many people are quick to call each other lazy. There are people who don't work hard in all levels, and it makes it hard to keep putting in a lot of effort._x000D_Hardest part of the job is when you feel like there is not enough coverage, which happens a lot!

Not family friendly,"Being an assistant pays well and provides a lot of experience in different situations, both business and people based. However, this position isn't always family friendly. I have worked in environments where the management works together and can create a more positive and productive environment. As more changed happen within the company I have noticed a more competitive and ""everyone for themselves"" type of environment which makes it difficult to create a unified team experience amongst the management and can trickle to the associates. In my experience this creates a lot of people issues  and needs to be handled with a unified front, fairly and consistently and often that is not the case. This often time results in long hours for salaried members of management which makes the job more difficult for people with families at home. _x000D_As much as I enjoy working with customers and associates, this job and position lean more toward people who are single and more career driven than family driven._x000D_Also, Politics are EVERYTHING with this company.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"San Diego, CA",3/28/19,2019,3,28

Most of your work will consist of unloading and stocking freight unless you are a cashier or maintenance associate/cart pusher.

Management is incompetent at identifying employees who exhibit a low standard of work ethic and applying corrective action.

It's Exactly How You Think it Will Be,"I enjoyed working at Walmart as a cashier through the holiday months. In fact, I would even say I was good at my job. When the time came for seasonal hires to be let go, I was offered a full-time position that I could not take at the time because of my school schedule. I was then offered a job in the grocery department with the promise that if I found that I did not like it, or I was not able to fulfill the job requirements, I could come back to the front. Upon arrival in my new department, I was assured that what I had been told was the case. I tried my new job for a month, and in that month it became clear that the managers were out of touch with the amount of work that was being asked and providing little to no help or guidance. After asking three different managers for my transfer, I finally had to ask the Department Manager directly and she told me that I would have to stay for 6 months (which is normal policy). It was at that point I decided to quit as I had clearly been lied to by at least two managers",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Longview, TX",3/27/19,2019,3,27

Neutral Stance,"I think every Walmart is different. I worked for a location that is high shrink meaning it has a lot of theft. There is a mix of good customers and sketchy ones. It is not uncommon to see a fist fight in the binging of the month when the store is super busy and everyone wants stuff. The management is okay. Some of management is fair and reasonable and others are very draconian. I think the work experience also depends on what department you are in and the manager above you. For me again a mix of good, bad and okay. I think working for Walmart is a great beginner job for people. I am honestly feel I have seen the good the bad and the ugly of the company and am grateful for the employment. I feel underappreciated at the end cause the company has changed some policies that make it harder to work for them long term or get bonuses. There are to many caviots that are meant to keep employees in their good graces but life happens and you can get in trouble for it even if not intentional.

Management didn’t know their face from their A**,"The job was nice and pay was good.  It’s the way the building was ran , and the way they just send new people home after 3-5 hours of work.

Depends on your department,"I’ve worked at Walmart for some time and while it it a good place to work for someone just out of high school, I would not recommend it long term (5+years).  Management changes can lead to complete revamping of department operations and rule changes that may interfere with getting things done.  Many stores are understaffed as well leading to associates getting stuck at the cash register and not getting things done in their departments during busy shopping days (ex: weekends). While this doesn’t affect my position (cart associate) as much, other departments have complained.  It all depends on where you work.",4,Current Employee,Cart Associate ,"Stafford, VA",3/26/19,2019,3,26

I've learned that people at Walmart are very nice and welcoming. the management at walmart are very nice and work with your hours sometimes depending at what the situation is. the culture everyone is always very sweet and welcoming when you come in. the hardest part of the job is when you stand on your feet for a 8 to 9 hours shift with a break maybe every couple hours if they don't forget about your break. the most enjoyable thing I think it has to offer is getting to talk to your friends sometimes during downtime and the community.,5,Current Employee,Ca ,"Granite Falls, NC",3/26/19,2019,3,26

"Ungrateful, stressful work days.",Not to say that all managers are bad because their are some good ones but the typical experience is that they do not care when you are working yourself to death they just want more. They only see what hasn’t been done yet instead of all the the things that you have done.  They do not appreciate their hard workers and lack the ability to give praise for a job well done.

Wow Wow Wow Walmart,"I was a sales floor associate in dry groceries for Walmart for two and a half weeks. The bad rumors that you hear about this company’s treatment of their employees is true. Pay is just above minimum wage. There are no benefits, not even an employee discount until you’ve worked there for 3 months. Then it is only 10%. You are responsible for buying your own uniform (blue polos and khaki pants), and I feel like I just came out even buying my uniforms, has to and from work, and lunch each day, because of how low pay is. As one of the richest companies in the world, they are good at helping their employees sign up for government assistance to supplement their low wages. _x000D__x000D_Here is my story, but ones like this are universal at this company. Orientation seems less like training and more like an anti-union rally. I work in a right to work state. You just watch videos about how evil labor unions are and how wonderful Sam Walton and his family are. I started getting sick during orientation with a fever and scratchy throat, but you shrug these things off at a new job. The last guy who those of us in orientation were replacing had made some negative comments about Walmart on his social media, so be wary of what you say in public while working here. _x000D__x000D_They require drug testing for new hires, so I went to a clinic and took a urine test. Not a big deal, passed with flying colors, but the only other job that has ever drug tested me was when I worked as a bank teller which is a totally different job. _x000D__x000D_My hiring manager wanted me to do my training modules during my breaks off the clock. - more...",1,Former Employee,Sales Floor Team Member ,"Lake Worth, TX",3/25/19,2019,3,25

There are some people that have been there for 5 years and still haven't made full time, at 40 hours a week. But what kills the job the most, is the management. Management is AWFUL. They use fear and scare tactics on their employees. Lie to them while grooming them for the position they hold, as an example, a department manager grooming you for her job. And then you find out even if he steps down, you won't be getting that position and have to compete with others trying to get it in interviews before you get it and it may not even be at that store. They harass you  by threats of looking at the cameras and watching your every move while you work. And if you have a problem? And use your open door policy? The store managers will slam the door in your face and offer no solution. GO above them? You need recorded proof. You need evidence. Theres no way to solve employee problems unless someone of your pay level attacks you. That's it. It's not a good place to work. Work is solid. Management is the worst I've ever seen.

A typical day as an employee at Wal-mart,"When working at Wal-mart you never knew what to expect. One day you may be a cashier and the next day you have to unload a truck. Although there wasn't much consistency, working there taught me several things, I now know how to work a pallet jack. The hardest part of the job for me was the lack of recognition, no matter how hard you worked, management always views your work productivity as insufficient. What I did enjoy about the job is being able to assist the customers.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service representative ,"Buffalo, NY",3/25/19,2019,3,25

It was horrible. No advancement unless they like you.,It's a horrible place to work. Also it depends what position you work at. Also I got paid as much as the new people got paid.  I was there for 3-4 years. They expect you to work like a robot. They brain wash you to hate unions. The management have no backbone when it comes to right and wrong and they don't care about the workers. They just care about getting the work done and looking good to the upper management all the while taking the credit for the workers that did all the work. They used to have it you can top off getting paid $20 hr. It took like fifteen years to get paid that high. Now it will never happen they keep coming out with ways to not pay the employees that much. I have more to say. But I'm tired of thinking about that place. I was lucky to have a good work ethic that's the reason I able to stay so long. One last thing they would make you work black Friday and that day is on thanksgiving day. I didn't get to go to family and friends for thanksgiving for few years. If you called in you would get fired unless they like you. They had favorites. Also if you could do what I did there I think I can work just about anywhere. I have to much to say. When I first started a co-worker told me a supervisor told him I  wasn't going to be working there long. When I started and transferred to a different department and not counting the group that was there when I left 86 people had either quit or got fired or work other department. Also same supervisor would follow you to the bathroom.

And the safety follows you around alot and can pull you over for speeding and write you up and put you on a step. They will tell you anything that you want to hear about how great walmart is. When sam Walton died walmarr died with him. It's like working for a corporation all you are is a number. When you call in it doesn't matter that they know you they will ask you for your driver number everytime. It takes 3 dollars a mile to operate and have a walmart driver pulling a load. If management can save the company money and make there bonuses fatter they will put that load on a train and save the company money. Or get a outside carrier to pull the load. Awhile you sit around waiting for a load you don't get paid. Only if your on the dock waiting to get unloaded.,1,Former Employee,Truck Driver ,"Fort Pierce, FL",3/24/19,2019,3,24

"Fast, upbeat workplace","A typical day is monitoring the self-checkouts and helping customers. I clean my area, restock bags, and pull customers into the self-checkout area when it gets slow. I learned better time management and how to work under pressure better. The management is polite for the most part, but could sometimes be more effective at taking care of some of the problems in the store and listening to us if we have concerns. Most of the people get along, although like anywhere there are cliques and gossip. The hardest part about the job is trying to get everything done myself when there are not enough people scheduled and the self-checkout area is completely filled with customers and five of them need help at once.

Pay is ok but resembles a old school sweat shop,"The maintenance dept. was OK but needed some equipment to do the job proficiently such as a mill/lathe. Seemed to have some issues carrying all the necessary stock of parts to keep critical systems in operation.  The associates on the other hand were treated poorly.  Disciplinary action for any accidents. Exceptionally hot in the summers with the floors sweating so bad that the footing was hazardous and the lifts like to slide due to the moisture. The rate was raised and many had issues making it. Breaks were very short and started from your location instead of when the break room was reached and some people had a long way to go. Ten hour work day you received a 20 min lunch and 15 min break that was paid for but again, kind of on the ""cheap"" side. Most places give you 2 breaks and a lunch period for 8 hours. The insurance was substandard from most places I have worked.",3,Former Employee,Maintenance Technician ,"Greencastle, IN",3/24/19,2019,3,24
Terrible company!!!,"A typical day at work at Walmart is ridiculous. People call out, management never really help and they don't appreciate you for staying back or helping out.

I never got a raise due to personal reasons with my managers instead of strictly job related or based on my job performance. I don't recommend anyone working for this company.

Management dose not know how to communicate,the work day would start out with having to chase a assistant manager down so that i could get my counts approved by them and if it was not done by the time period that they gave me it would be denied by the system and if i ordered some thing for a customer in the system a assistant manager would go in to the system and cancel it.,2,Former Employee,service writer ,"Edgewood, NM",3/24/19,2019,3,24

Worst job when in school,"I worked at Walmart for 10 months just to get terminated because I was in the hospital and physically unable to work. The management was terrible they were always rude and did not communicate.  Everyone starts at 11 an hour so it is good pay, but the only way you will get a raise or advance in the company is if you are favored by your managers. They don't advance you based on your work ethic. I also am in college and told them I needed fewer hours because as a music major 37 hours and 7 classes were too much for me- that is what put me in the hospital. They took 2 months to change my availability and they refused fewer hours. I was mentally, physically and emotionally tired and unhealthy. A terrible job would never go back.

It was great.... until,"Working for Walmart was an amazing experience especially working in the Loss Prevention field. However, management did have their favorites and I was not one of them for what ever reason. I was terminated from Walmart for reaching the threshold for points before you were terminated. With this, I was sick, throwing up at work, and had to leave to go to the doctors. With excuse in hand putting me out of work for a period of 1 week, I came back to work and tried to hand them my doctors note. They did not accept it and would not remove the 7 points (1 point per day) from my record. After I came back from being sick, I worked one day, was off the next and I was terminated on my day off. I went to work the following day thinking I had a job, but they did not bother to call me saying to not come to work. So after showing up, I found out I was terminated and had to turn right back around and drive 45 minutes home. Circling back to the point system, I know for a fact they could have taken those points off. As asset protection, we get notified every time a change is made where points were taken off, or attendance times were adjusted. There were certain people that would constantly have their points removed and were able to keep their job but not me.",2,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Montgomery, AL",3/24/19,2019,3,24

They definitely felt like they could always teach me new things to do on the job. Its also nice the breaks they give you when you work a full shift.

"its walmart, what more do you need to know.","There is not much to say about Walmart, either one has worked there and ""knows"" or one has not.

Honestly not a great place,"The management gets cycled quarterly so there's always someone else to not remember your name or not care about your situation. Management is unhelpful and sometimes managers from different areas ""come after"" you either because they don't like you or they don't like someone you talk to. I worked at 3 different walmart's in Colorado over the course of 6 years. Every store was the same in that regard. Every manager has a ""Group"" of associates they hang out with and will never punish under any circumstances. I watched 10,000$ mess ups get swept under the rug for some people, and for a 50$ mess up had to fire people. Turnover is insanely high because the only people willing to stick around this atmosphere long term are the truly desperate or lazy.",1,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,Colorado,3/23/19,2019,3,23

Cashier,A typical day at work for me would be coming in with the right attire on as far a job id and the right uniform.

A majority of the time my job was pretty easy kind of laid-back at times normally my co-workers made it fun. Even as a supervisor the same co-workers made it enjoyable it bearable to make it through today. Management was the only problem at times either overworking us expected us to do the work it would take a bigger group to do or ready to throw us under the bus because they got in trouble.

"Fun workplace, depends on managers attitude.",Management is the only reason you will dislike your job. If they don’t look down their nose at you like you’re less important.

It was a great opportunity for benefits.,I liked working at Walmart for the most part.  I really loved the department I worked and was placed into.

Sales Associate,"Our store was chaotic. I almost always had 36-40 hour weeks and I was alone quite often. The department looked like a war zone every night because I didn’t have the freedom to leave the my post until the last hour of my shift, when my part of the department closed. Never got to finish my training since I was always demanded to be on the floor. Was dragged away to zone and move stock for other departments. I, for some reason, was a magnet for very rude customers as the operator, and was threatened often with complaints to corporate. Since I never did anything wrong, I always told the customers to go ahead and that I had other calls I had to take and that I needed to hang up now. Was questioned about incidents afterwards but never beyond one or two questions, and was never written up. Faced quite a few snippy 3rd shift associates, so I often would go on break right when the 3rd shift starts, just so I could avoid conflict that could make my shift anymore worse than it already was._x000D__x000D_The one piece of advice that I had shared with management multiple times, was that the store needed an operator separate from the departments. They need someone who is better suited for dealing withirate customers. That would make fitting room attendant’s jobs easier, especially with how angry some of the customers got over the phone. It would also keep the manager’s business more private from the customers who would come to try on clothes, since the operator used a walkie-talkie to communicate with management. Customers got to hear what some of the managers thought of them, as well as the store itself. - more...",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Florida,3/23/19,2019,3,23

Then I was forced to sign papers again to be part time after holidays. It was very upsetting. My coworkers and I got along well except for the dept. manager. She treated us poorly, talked terrible about us behind our back, and acted like she was better than us.  There was also retaliation where our hours would get cut if we told upper management about issues which is what you are told to do.

Good Benefits,"Great Company to work for Overall, I have enjoyed working for the company for the most part, it is not a difficult place to work, its easy to learn, The difficult part is the harsh attendance policy they have, Makes it stressful sometimes when you cant get a point approved if it was not avoidable and you cant do anything to prevent the circumstances, there are some ways around it, but it tends to be very time consuming and not all options tend to get explained in detail.",4,Current Employee,Garden Center Associate ,"Mineral Wells, TX",3/23/19,2019,3,23

After a year of running the department myself and overseeing two other associates and starting to oversee the toy department, an outside manager was brought in and took over the job I was being setup for.

Walmart is a decent place to start a job at.,"Working for Walmart opened my eyes to what goes on behind closed doors. I learned that a lot of people who have been there don't get promoted and new hires do. A typical day for myself was to come into work, clock in, run register/fill prescriptions, take breaks and lunch and go home. It was clockwork for my job, and very easy. Management was a joke. My manager was great but outside of the pharmacy, you couldn't find a decent manager. The managers were always trying to tell us in the pharmacy (who was a separate entity from the store) that we were going over their hours and what not when we had our own set hours outside of theirs. You couldn't ever find a manager when you needed one and the CSM'S (Customer service managers) were always slow and non-responsive when they were needed back in the pharmacy. There would be times we would wait for 15 minutes before they got back to the pharmacy. Overall, the job was easy but the work-life culture sucked. I dreaded going to work because of the issues with management and if a problem would come up they would drag their feet (unless it was to write you up for a mistake that a CSM made but threw the blame on the employee to cover their butt) and never respond fast enough to a problem. I generally figured out most of the problems myself, with help of my coworkers (if my manager wasn't there).",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Associate ,"Sayre, PA",3/22/19,2019,3,22

Gained customer skills and worked with great people,"Jet was a great company to work for. There were opportunities to work over time, especially during peak season. Typical day at work would be taking 20-30 interactions with phone, emails or chats. There were more interactions during peak season. There would be a few difficult calls every now and then but I would always have great support if I had questions. I learned customer service skills using soft skills and deescalating. I always liked how we had the empowerment on choosing the best resolution for the customer. I always liked my supervisors and managers. They always made you feel like you had a voice and could go to them if you had any concerns. The hardest part of the job would be the tough calls where you feel like you have done everything for the customer and gave them their options but were still not happy. Not being able to cancel orders after 30 minutes would be sometimes difficult to handle but still let them know Jet has free returns.

This company cares less about the people but it’s financial  advancement!,One of the things I enjoy most about working for Wal-Mart is it’s diversity. Being able to work with and meet people from all backgrounds. They have a pretty good health care plan but don’t always comply with it as far as not accepting doctors excuse for those physically unable to work due to Haley’s issues. This company does not care for the people by taking away their holiday to be with family and if a loved one passed not showing concern nor sending a simple condolences. It’s impossible for parents to tend to their children based off the New scheduling system they have. In all honesty they need to do a restructure with management starting from corporate on down because this company is no longer concerned with what you know but who you know to get ahead. We’ve loss a lot of great managers who focus was the business and the people behind such.

Terrible company to work for!,"I have been working for Walmart for almost 3 years. When I first started I LOVED it. But as time went on I began to realize how much favoritism there is and how poor management is. I started to think it was just the store I work at but other people I know that work for the company say the same thing. Their new attendance policy is dumb. You get 5 points total. Being late is .5 and calling out/missing a shift is 1. After 5 points you’re out of there. They don’t take doctors notes or excuses for kids, family or emergencies. You get penalized regardless of the excuse. Literally.  They have “protected PTO” which you can use but it takes forever to accumulate it to use it because the hours are inconsistent. I honestly wouldnt recommend working here to anyone. They don’t treat their associates right. They’re open on thanksgiving ALL day and everyone works regardless of when you told them you were available and they’re always understaffed.

Job for younger people,"I enjoyed my time there despite 6 months only but until they create numbers that are obtainable for pickers without them actually ""cheating the system"" (working through break, working through paid lunch, etc. I seen it all and people will do this to keep their 100%), I don't see this as a job for anyone 35 and older unless you get involved in a different department other than being an order filler. Even with that said, forkilift operators, replenishers, etc. have a quota base job as well. It's dog eat dog mentality there and as long as people are making their numbers, they could care less about anyone new or anyone that struggles with learning the curves. There's retraining available but the welcome mat wears thin after two or three times at this. You hit so many ""steps"" and they let you go and God forbid you need a band-aid or get an injury, the blame goes on you and you get written up for it because they will find a way to report it as something you did wrong (lifting wrong, stacking wrong, the list goes on) and they try to re-enact the events despite they weren't there to witness any of it. They just go by the info you give them (or the persons involved) - quite humorous really despite the seriousness of the situation.",3,Former Employee,Order Picker ,"Pottsville, PA",3/20/19,2019,3,20

Very stressful during Holidays,Walmart was very good to me the 12 years I was there but it is not a easy job. It is very stressful to be a Deptment Manager for them because you are responsible for everything that goes on in your Department. A lot of times you don't have adequate help to accomplish the daily goals that pop up. During the Holidays is the busiest and most stressful times and you pretty much live there and have no time with your family. But it was a steady income and the pay was decent so it made up for it,4,Former Employee,Dept. Manager ,"Troy, MI",3/20/19,2019,3,20

You have to be willing,I have worked at worse  places but Walmart is not great. The schedule is flexible but they often dont take account into your availability.

A negative is they hire warm bodies and won't fire them to others are expected to pick up the slack.

I am the first person my associates are to report to unless it is something that I am not eligible to do.  I also work with my mod team to make sure they are resetting the departments to corporate standards.

Easy Work Ruined By Management,"The job in and of itself is not are particularly difficult one, although physically demanding and definitely not for the weak and frail, at least not the position I worked.  Although you are typically tasked with a lot during the work day, the 8 hour shifts they make you work provide more than enough time to complete all duties in a satisfactory manor. My problems arose at this job specifically after about 9 months when the store manager left along with over 90 other associates and managers.  The team of management that came after that regime was completely new (from the Assistant Managers to the Market Manager) and each person had conflicting ideas on how to achieve the same results we had been achieving before.  The newer managers seemed to care more about the process than the end result, which in turn slowed everything down and created internal problems a divide between associates and managers that hadn't been resolved by the time I left about a year later.",3,Former Employee,CAP-2 Associate ,"Cranberry Township, PA",3/20/19,2019,3,20

NOTHING is as CORPORATE states in printed materials, computer training is extremely outdated and has nothing to do with how things actually ""work"" on the floor. On the floor ""training"" is a total joke, you are taught by people who don't even know what they are doing, and don't care.

I've had managers tell me and other associates to let customers scream and cuss at us until we feel our lives are absolutely threatened. The turn over rate in my store was almost 125% when I quit but they constantly fired people for crazy stuff like preventing stealing or getting into car accidents and missing their shift. Management did whatever they wanted whenever they wanted and HR backed it up. The drama ran rampant like a high school. My coworkers were amazing people, but a person can only take so much.

I spoke to someone in personnel and she told me to speak to my manager, I thought I had but you never really know who is in charge of you until you meet them by the grace of God or if you get in trouble I guess.

If your desperate sure if your not don’t do it!,Like I said if your desperate then go for it but if your not then don’t. It was the single worst job I’ve ever had. The turnover rate was so bad. They would hire you with the promise of full time hours but they would never give you it. After three months had passed I got two weeks of 40 hours each. That was it and I was promised 40 hours the whole time. If you got any overtime of your record you got in big trouble and they would threaten to lower your hours. I was treated very poorly and many other people were too. If you really need money then try it. They will be nice to you for about a week or two and then turn to there true form immediately.

"It's overall a good place to work, despite its drawbacks.","My experience at Walmart is largely positive. The pay is pretty good, especially when compared to manual labor positions, and my coworkers are friendly and inviting, with some inevitable exceptions.

I actually loved working at Walmart,"I loved working at Walmart. I loved having a big team store wide. The biggest downside is the occasional pressure, if a coworker calls out, and customers. Customers can be incredibly rude and unfortunately sometimes you just have to stand there and accept their rudeness. _x000D_The company was very nice to work for. I had some pretty awesome managers who had been recently promoted which made me feel really good about where Walmart stood with the development of the company. You could tell that the company was improving. _x000D_Downside was that when Walmart raised their wages, the employees who had been there for years and years got matched with the new hires or sometimes made less than new hires, which meant all their raises were technically gone. I felt like that was extremely wrong. These employees are loyal and should have gotten their 10-15+ year raises on top of the recent wage leveling. It made me pretty upset at the company to see that. _x000D_I had also seen some people get hired behind me and make more money or get higher raises based off their percentage of pay. I was asked to interview to become a manager, was not promoted, but was complimented greatly on my hard work and problem solving skills. Then shortly after, raises were given and I had literally received the lowest raise because my position was technically lower than those around me and it went off percentage of my current rate and not job performance. It was very discouraging, embarrassing, and it felt like the company didn't care necessarily. _x000D_I really enjoy working and Walmart will keep you busy.

Typical Grocery Store Environment,"There really is no need to go into what it's like working for Walmart. I will say that Walmart isn't nearly as bad as most people think it is. The pay is fair, despite what you will hear from other sources. The hourly wage is very fair with raises coming annually. There are occasional mandates to cut hours. So, there are times when you won't get a full 40 hours in a week. And I personally know several people who have worked at Walmart for decades and have raised kids that they put through college and still live a reasonably comfortable life.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,North Texas,3/18/19,2019,3,18
"If you are a female and over 50 I, would not recommend.",The younger management that works over you has no respect for the older generation over 50. The company does not take it any consideration in any injuries that you might have had before coming to the company. They will still expect you to be able to do your job and the amount of time you are giving. And the Walmart I worked at considered the amount of time you're doing to stock the shelves was more important than the customer,5,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Derby, KS",3/18/19,2019,3,18
Its alright I guess,"I requested to work in electronics on my application but they decided to move me to the remodel position, it was by far one of the more stressful jobs when dealing with three to four managers requesting things to be done in a short amount of time especially when I was the only one they assigned to the task.",3,Former Employee,Remodel Associate ,"Raleigh, NC",3/18/19,2019,3,18

Fast Paced and Challenging,"While working for this company I learned a lot about training and making executive decisions. Management didn't check in with us so it was a lot of making the best decision for the customers. The work was the same every day so it was easy to get into a routine.

Productive and easy work and can be stressful at times,Working at Walmart I learned some things.

Overall Bad working environment,"If you have a problem with a worker dont talk to anyone about it if they happen to be good friends with management. in my 8-9 years with the company workers constantly fraternize with management. Smoking cigarettes and weed are very much a bonding activity depending on the shift you work on and they dont even hide it._x000D__x000D_I was in an understaffed location...... by Walmart standards they let 7 out of the 12 night crew smoke weed all the time and not really meet quotas. so i was overworked and had to stay late everyday, and the managers tried writing me up for overtime which was accrued due to the bad workers that plugged items and left on time instead of picking up the slack they caused. the morning shift that was supposed to be in charge of handling the top stock and binning blamed us for the counts being wrong and forced freight out and messed up the numbers. All they had to do was change a number on the hand held device._x000D__x000D_Im glad i left that place, if you want a decent start in retail and learn the ropes give it a go, but i would not make it long term.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Middletown, NY",3/18/19,2019,3,18

Not what it once was,"Started at Walmart in 2015 and it seemed like a really good place to work and I mainly enjoyed the job during this time.  Had the opportunity to transfer to Sam's in 2016, which I did, and that was wonderful.  However, my club closed in 2018, forcing me to go back to Walmart, in the process.  The 2nd time around was terrible.  Too many new initiatives and changes, all focused at covering the company's behind, yet disguised as ""customer"" related.... Job was about customers, at one point, but when I came back to Walmart, it was all about numbers, just like the other retail pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, etc.)",2,Former Employee,Pharmacy Manager/Staff Pharmacist ,"Baton Rouge, LA",3/18/19,2019,3,18
Work anywhere else,"Don't let any of the hiring posters or management fool you, this is the worst place. Prepare to be belittled every day and watch your management play favorites.

Gone Downhill Fast,"I have worked at Walmart for 2 years now. I used to enjoy coming to work and being a part of the ""team"". Management was friendly and supportive while laying down firm instructions. It used to be about providing the best experience not just for the customers, but for the employees as well. Now, its all about making quotas and cutting costs. I love my coworkers and need the money to pay bills- pretty much the only reason I'm still working here. New management is nonexistent, either can never find or refuses to help out with the ""grunt work"". People are quitting/leaving/getting fired in droves and no one is being hired to replace them. The remaining workers are now left to pick up the work of several other people plus themselves and get everything done in their allotted shift or risk getting coached for incomplete work/overtime. The new attendance policy, supposedly brought up by employees, is awful as calling out now affects your quarterly bonus. What they don't tell you is that they brought the days off from 9 per 6 months down to 5 (5 unexcused absences and you're fired). Now, these days are unpaid unless you request it out of your PTO, which is accrued (8 hours or so every 6 weeks-this is also how you get paid vacations, etc.). The protected PTO is also accrued and you still get a ""point"" for your unexcused absence if you do not have the PTO to cover the day (8 hour shift = 8 hours of PTO). Basically, they took away our days off, our bonuses, and our morale.",2,Current Employee,Fresh Production Associate ,"New Port Richey, FL",3/17/19,2019,3,17

Awful place,This is one of the worst companies to work for. They will work and work and work you when it's  convenient  for them and benefit them but have no problem not giving you hours. For someone who is Full Time and only getting 10 hours a week? And management is useless they can't run that store. They do not no how to do a thing. They don't know how to mix paint make keys sell a gun activate a phone work in photo do pickup or  run the front end and do not help when lines get backed up or there are no carts but have no problems yelling at the CSM'S who do way more then they should for as little as they get paid. It's a shame that Walmart has become such a terrible place to work. Management thinks they are better then you but can't run a store? Also one of the managers goes to work with alcohol on his breath but they don't do a thing. If you want a job with no hours and being degraded then this is the place for you otherwise don't waste you time or energy because they do not appreciate a thing u do it's never ever ever good enough for them.,1,Former Employee,Connection Center Sales Associate ,"Vestal, NY",3/16/19,2019,3,16

It was not just me others that have been there longer than i was getting the same rate of pay as new people. Hours cut.

"As the ONLY Full time Cart Pusher, it kind of sucked","The job description was vague, it didn't tell the full response abilities, and I was often left alone due to the fact no one else was full time. The managers were lacking in checking up on me and they failed to see that one man is not enough to keep up with a population of 7,000; especially on holidays where everyone takes time off to go shopping. 9 out of 10 shoppers often take there anger out on me, and because few to no people brushing up on driving laws, I've almost lost my life to careless drivers not watching out for pedestrians.

Not the greatest of jobs,"If you apply at Walmart please do not put in for overnight stocking.

"when you sign the contract, you sign your life","I have worked in three different stores as a manager and in every single store the store managers were jerks. They would do anything to cover their self. Even if they tell you to do something and they get in trouble for it, trust me when I say they will throw you under the bus and role over you ten more times. I've never been in an environment where every one around me felt like snakes. I would already work 10- 12 hour shifts and they would still some times make us stay 5 more hours for things that were beyond our control. The store manager always made sure he left on time which is something that I could not respect. The co-managers were no better they would talk about things they knew were wrong but would not do a thing to change it.

This job will suck the life out of you,"I’m a part time student and I applied to be a part time worker at this company. When I got hired the same day I went in for my interview, I was told I could get up to 40 hours a week and still get my two days off for school. Although 40 hours a week in just 5 days seemed a lot, I was just happy to be there. But I realized quickly it wasn’t what I expected. My first couple of days were sketchy, as I was always confused on where to go and where to be. When I finally got somewhat setteled in, they put me on the floor with a bunch of new girls who knew about the same amount of directions as I did, which was nothing. I had to learn on the job mostly, and it didn’t help that my department manager wasn’t even there for almost 6-8 weeks. For the first couple of weeks I wasn’t meeting 40 hours, which was good for me personally because I had school and still had a life besides strictly work/school. But then slowly but surely, we had many associates quit, not show up, or get fired in the matter of weeks, leaving the department with minimal workers. We would then get in trouble for not being able to complete a shifts amount of work that should be split up between at least 8 people, with literally 3 people on the floor. It started to become impossible to complete work, especially when associates called in. Also, because there was less people, we started to reach 40 hours easily, which meant 9 hours a day (for 5 days) and 2 days off for school for me... which was stressful and honestly so draining.

Every week when the schedule came out they still had me at part time hours. I continuesly had to go to management to get them to change my hours.

overnight stocker and backup customer service supervisor,"Walmart began as a good place to work but unfortunately management said they would be great but some turned out not to be great. Those that were great were helpful and appreciated employees and their work. These bosses were the ones who kept me there and helped me move up to a customer service supervisor. Three nights a week I am a stocker and two nights a week I am in charge up front. I was encouraged by few management but it was worth waiting for these types of managers. I look for managers who care about their employees which are who I work for currently. I am still learning but we all have to evolve into our work place. Hardest part of the job honestly is how hot it is in the store especially one side of the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is my fellow employees.

This Is Just a Stepping Stone,Being a cart pusher teaches you that you either want to stay as a cart pusher or you want to move forward with your life.

un-eventful place to work with lazy managers,The people were good to work with management was not. Everytime you would do what they asked you they would change the next day.

0/10 Would NOT recomend under any cercumstance,"So I don't like to trash on anyone or anything most of the time. Its in-necessary and it wastes both of our times. That being said Walmart was the absolute worse. I was fired from Walmart for scanning a customers items with the scanner. On top of that Walmart is so corporate run that you can't do anything without thinking first ""is there even a 1% chance this goes wrong"" for example ""helping a customer in a motorized scooter get up and into their car"" the something that could go wrong is that someone could slip and the lady could fall and you would get written up for even helping her. There is also the ranks of managers there's CSM (9ish), assistant department managers (15ish), department managers (15ish), assistant manager(5ish), store manager(1), district manager(1). for those of you that don't want to do that math that is about 46 managers that you are always paranoid by when you walk by them. The CSM's were in 2 categories (Very Nice and Strictest people in the world) and half of them were in both categories depending on the day.

I liked it well enough to be there 6+ years.,"It was rough starting out, but over time the job got easier. Most of my coworkers are amazing. The management team has shifted over the years and I've seen a lot of people come and go. There's been lots of changes, some good and some bad. Just like any other place. My main reason for leaving is the low pay, unfair raises based on work performance evaluations and stagnant wages. There's four levels of pay grades. I started out as a level 2 in the meat department making $7.85 an hour and after 3 years was making $8.50 an hour. I got promoted almost 3 years ago and have been making $12.50 for the last three years and just now got a 2% raise. That's only a quarter. the raises used to be up to 50 cents. And the workload gets worse while the pay stays the same. I still recommend it, but I'm over it. The benefits are pretty good. The hours vary depending on department and your availability. It's nice though, because if you ever want to get rehired, you get first pick of openings. The discounts, PTO and quarterly bonuses helped me stick around. I also LOVE my store. But the company itself needs to step up and appreciate the associates more.",4,Current Employee,DEPARTMENT MANAGER ,"Goddard, KS",3/13/19,2019,3,13

Losing site of employees,"When I started at Walmart, it was very employee-oriented. They were very understanding of life issues and commitments. Recently, they really that messed up. We are constantly short-staffed with a high turnover rate and there is no more leniency unless you have children. I am constantly struggling with scheduling conflicts because my manager overrides my schedule to make me work more than I say I can which really hurts other aspects of life (school, family, health). Therefore, I am constantly getting in trouble for not coming into work. In addition, since I work in the pharmacy, no one outside of the pharmacy wants to deal with these issues. There are many other complaints I hear from other employees including, no leniency for weather, family commitments, or health issues.

"Quick-paced, The customer is always right no matter what.","The registers are pretty straight-forward. However, you need a CSM's approval to do anything other than a basic transaction. This makes transactions time-consuming and wastes a customer's time when the CSMs take a while to respond. Sometimes the CSMs never show up no matter how many times you call them. This is especially annoying when you call for change that you desperately need and you have to start turning customers away unless they aren't paying with cash. There aren't enough CSMs to properly assist the cashiers. Some of them are nice, some of them are extremely rude. You could have a college degree and some of them would still treat you like you're an idiot. There is a lot of favoritism as well. The schedule is inconsistent. Also, the rate of pay means nothing when you aren't scheduled enough. Walmart majorly shorts you on hours from New Years to summer, so if you're paying bills alone, try to find a better paying job that actually offers you healthcare right away. If you have help paying the bills, actually want a lot of time off, and can keep your mouth shut when customers and managers treat you like garbage, this may be the job for you.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Summersville, WV",3/12/19,2019,3,12

Depends on management,"If you get a good manager,  walmart is a fun place to work. Unfortunately none of my managers were good. They were average on their best days. They have a new attendance policy that will affect your myshare (THAT YOU WORK HARD FOR). If you never call out you will receive 125% of your myshare but if you call out once you are at 100% and more call outs equal less myshare until you hit 5 points and are fired. They do have protected PTO for days when you need to call out and so you won't get a point. Only catch is that, the amount of protected PTO you earn is a joke.",2,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Springfield, MO",3/12/19,2019,3,12
No joy working here anymore,The company has gotten bad. They make it difficult for people to take vacations and sick time. They play favorites. They don't care about helping you and the managers are horrible. The people who work hard get penalized and the ones who do no work get rewarded. They are always understaffed in every department. Management lets you struggle instead of helping. They claim they only hire part time anymore but then you find out they give others full time that don't even care to do any work.,2,Current Employee,Cashier ,FL,3/12/19,2019,3,12

"decent,","its hard work and much lifting, there is frustration when other associates don't do their job properly, and customers make a mess and don't care to say anything or clean it up, management is good when they want to be. i learned that i am very particular on how things should be in my mind. i have become a perfectionist in some ways, most enjoyable would be, being able to bring out from the back exactly what a customer is looking for and seeing the excitement on their face that we actually had what they were looking for.",4,Former Employee,Dairy Associate ,"Lewisburg, PA",3/12/19,2019,3,12

Company did not treat all associates in a fair manner,"Wal-Mart Pharmacy was a very fast pace area of the store to work in. Plenty of work that to keep a person busy.  There were definitely favorites that the management had and it showed.  The associates that had more knowledge and long term employment with the company was expected to do the bulk of the work, while those that were the favorites were allowed to just stand and talk, laugh and goof around with the managers.

An okay job if it’s your only option.,"Management does not care about you. They like to pretend that they do but they could care les if you work there or not. Even if your work ethic is superior to everyone else’s. On the outside looking in it seems like a good job. However the more you stay there you realize it is trash. All they want is money. They want you to kill yourselves for them. Work all hours of the day. To get their stuff together. You can stay over for that but then you need to cut it later on. I worked full time with 11/hr on Cap 2 and my salary was still less than 20,000. It’s an actual trash place to work. In the end Walmart is going to run itself into the ground.

Poor Management,"The management just throws you into the thick of things without any explanation or description of what you're supposed to do and not do.

"The environment was nice, and the coworkers. The management was poor and that always fell on the employees.","Stretched a growing, time sensitive, workload among small space, and short staff.  At first it was a challenge, which was fun, then it just got ridiculous. I saw some of the strongest coworkers break down crying on a regular day because the workload wasn't distributed fairly, and usually the same employees got most of the worst parts of the job. Felt obligated to stay everyday because your team would get overloaded if you left when you were scheduled to leave. The place kept falling apart. Would be a perfect place to work, if it was ran by someone. Just 1 person calling in would set the whole day back if we couldn't find someone to fill in that spot. The most enjoyable part of the job for most was a smoke break. Sometimes you couldn't even take your lunch because it would set everything back and make the day worse.",2,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Olive Branch, MS",3/11/19,2019,3,11

The Worst management and NO OT,"Customers are the craziest attitudes you will ever see.  You will see some serious customers that just make you wonder if your really seeing this. Management is not at all professional. WAY TOO UNDER STAFFED. People always calling off, but yet they don’t offer OT at all.  My very first day, l was hired for the Deli dept and the trainer called off and so when I entered to do my job , there wasn’t anyone to train me and there was 3 people waiting in line to be helped and l was the only one in my dept.  l should have ran out the door. That should have been an eye opener for me.  Everyday there are so many call offs and that is seriously why Walmart has the EXTREMELY LONG LINES when you want to pay for a milk and you have to wait more than 20 minutes.",2,Former Employee,Supercenter Customer Service ,"Aurora, IL",3/11/19,2019,3,11

Not a very Good Work Environment,I'm not sure if all Walmarts are like the one I worked at but this particular store is not run very well.  The managers don't seem to have a very good handle on what is going on within the store.  This store also doesn't treat its employees very well and it is almost impossible to get any real benefits from this job.  The managers have figured out a way around giving their employees full-time status even though the employees work full-time hours.,2,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Corinth, MS 38834",3/10/19,2019,3,10
COULD be a good place if there were better managers.,"It's a job if you need a paycheck but the hours are unreliable and so is management.

If you run into anyone that is a manager that does not know how to treat people, or follow certain rules that need to be followed, you may have a bad day.  _x000D_     Recently, they have changed it to be more difficult for anyone to have an outside life by controlling scheduling, and cutting hours if you are not available.   The point system for calling out has changed as well. Yes they did improve it for those that do their job by rewarding them with .25% more on the myshare bonus if they do not call in.

Unorganized mess,If you enjoy working with a Team of confusion this is the place for you.  They will work you too death because they are always short staff due to the constant firing and quitting.  If you have a family you will never have time for them.  The 8240 warehouse in Atlanta is the absolute worst place I've actually worked at. Associates are not properly trained on basic things. Management is never on the same page. They will move you all over the warehouse as they please without prior proper training or instructions  and say they can do so because you're new.  Rules change weekly if not daily. You're force to leave for break late and come back early or be written up. Everything is based on production numbers even if it means shipping broken or damaged items out to customers.  Long story short DO NOT PLAN ON WORKING HERE LONG,1,Former Employee,Consolidation Associate ,"Atlanta, GA",3/9/19,2019,3,9

Its alright,"If you work good under pressure, like Fast paced then I would suggest this job.

Corporate decided instead of giving hours based off of who had been there the longest, it would be made to whoever has the most open of the availability. So if you could only work M-F 5am-9pm and S/S 8am-7pm you will have generally no hours. For the first year i was there i was getting 30-38 hours a week and life was great.

Beware of management and production.,"Management is my biggest gripe about the job. Management in addition to how physical the job is. I worked the job for about 9 months and while on the surface the job appears to be great by offering halfway decent pay and accumulated time off, when the job gets going and you realize you'll be unloading trucks by hand a lot of times (if not all the time depending on position. Unloaders use their own hands as forklifts) it becomes tiring, redundant, and tedious. i made management my biggest complaint not really because of the actual managers themselves, but i mean management in regards to the way the warehouse was managed, as a lot of the ridiculous expectations did not come from the managers individually. everything in the warehouse came down to production, and if you were in a position that did not quiet rely on production, then you were considered lucky. most times the production were just too high of an expectation to trully be considered realistic. and when you've got walmart trying to compete with amazon and seemingly losing the race, the management expects to make up for it by relying on the employees to work faster and more efficient. this is where the main concerns unfolded. the main issue with management was that they had very unrealistic expectations regarding the warehouse staff both in what can be accomplished as a team, as well as what was possible for the individual to accomplish in a timely manner.  Production is the one thing at this job i feel that really turns everything sour. the warehouse has a very high turnover rate as the demands that the production sheet - more...",3,Former Employee,Freight Handler/Forklift Operator ,"Baytown, TX",3/7/19,2019,3,7

"Meh, at best.",Management does not support you. They do what it takes to achieve their goals. They do not care about a work/life balance. They barely cared about your home life.

Each store is VASTLY different,"I evened out most of my scores because I’ve worked in two Walmart locations. Store 383 (Silsbee, TX) was amazing. Coworkers were close, management was great, and they were very understanding of scheduling conflicts, as long as they were aware at least 2 weeks in advance. However, store 1253 (Austin, TX) was MISERABLE. Coworkers (and some management) never learned each other’s names. Nobody spoke to each other, even productively. Managers were vague with instruction and refused to elaborate. Management would deny requested time off, regardless of reason (including family obligations, like a family members scheduled surgery date, requested over a MONTH in advance). I was consistently scheduled for times I could not work (I.e. during times I had class at UT, times outside my regular availability, etc) That store was a nightmare.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Austin, TX",3/7/19,2019,3,7

Downhill fast,"I’ve work in both the store (Dunwoody) and now the warehouse (ATL1). The pay is pretty good; it’ll get you somewhere. The least you’ll start with is $13.50 at the warehouse, but honestly not all money is good money. Management is ever changing. Rules come out of nowhere. Every time you turn around your getting a point for something. The most recent issue with the point system has been “productivity “. That’s actually one of their favorite words, that and “safety”. You can honestly work your hardest, but if work slows or you’re doing anything productive (and they’re aware) and it can’t be scanned (ie downstacking) look forward to an occurrence. It gets better; I received an occurrence for productivity and I wasn’t in the building period. Their logic was I “wasn’t singled out, everyone got one that day so its cool.” They don’t fight for their people, they replace you. You would think before passing out one to everyone they would think to investigate it. Doesn’t it sound strange, almost everyone including two people who were out on bereavement. Yes, we can open door most things, but you get tired of running back and forth. _x000D_For the most part everyone is cool.

Productive and somewhat pleasant workplace,"I started working at the only Walmart in a small college town in 2015 as an overnight stocker. There were not very many customers that came into the store when I worked, but I enjoyed my work in the evenings because the managers and my co-workers were pleasant towards me. I started working as a fitting room associate, and I was alone sometimes. I answered the phone whenever it rang. I did a lot of sorting and folding, and I got familiar with most of the products that Walmart has. I used the radio to communicate with the managers at that store whenever it was needed, and they were somewhat easygoing and relaxed most of the time. Then I moved to a fitting room associate during the daytime, and there were more people calling and asking for assistance with the fitting room but there were also more people there that I worked with, and that job was fairly easy. I moved to a cashier position at the beginning of 2017. I liked my job for the most part, but sometimes it was difficult because I would encounter a problem with the cash register, or run out of certain bills in my register sometimes, and need to get a manager to come to the register to help me, but they were often busy with other things, so I would have to wait. I moved to a different store and it was not nearly as nice as the first store I went to, it was much busier and the managers did not treat me very well because of a disability that I have. I was on some prescribed medication at the time that made me feel sick almost all the time, and I kept having to use the bathroom because of it, and sometimes I spent like 10-15 - more...",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Pullman, WA and Spokane, WA",3/7/19,2019,3,7

When did it stop being “Customers first”?,"When I first started working here, I felt like management actually cared about our customers and their experience at our store. I still feel that way, but corporate is making that next to impossible for us as employees to follow. Most days, we don’t even have enough people on the front end to have more than one register open at a time, leaving our customers upset and frustrated. I hear more and more customers saying things like “this is a joke” or “why do we still shop here?”. I have seen many instances where the people running the front end have to do that from a register, a door, or the service desk. When those people call for help on the front end due to long lines, they rarely get a response, and when they do help doesn’t show up until ten to twenty minutes after the first call. Part of the reason is that we simply don’t have enough staff. Part of the reason is simply because there is no sense of urgency in this store to do what we need to do to make our customers happy. We have 18 self checkouts and 14 regular registers and on most shifts (mostly at night) we rarely have more than 8 people on the front end to run these registers. These 8 people include the 2 door greeters, the person at the service desk, and the 2 people who are in charge of running the front end. This leave 3 cashiers. 1 for the grocery side self checkout, 1 for the general merchandise self checkout and 1 for the registers. All because corporate is regulating labor instead of each individual store like we used to. So much for caring about our customers.",2,Current Employee,Front End Worker ,"Hutchinson, MN",3/6/19,2019,3,6

Average pay/hours for the amount of stress you have to shoulder,"A typical day at Walmart  is helping customers to find items and working the cash register. But either way you deal with angry people who want everything to be perfect and the moment they can't find something or a price is not what they expect, you have to hear all kinds of mess come out of their mouths.

"very few hours, zero health benefits, poor management","During the interview process they will promise you a minimum of 35 hours a week, which becomes 15-20 hours a week anytime it is not the Christmas season. Forget about health insurance, you are on your own there. Each manager has their own set of rules and policies. There is NO communication between members of management, one manager will expect one thing while the next will expect the opposite. The company talks about safety and teamwork but it is only small talk, one will regularly be asked to perform tasks that are not safe. Watch out for your fingers and hands! Make sure you brown nose to the managers because favoritism and politics takes place here.

Easy going and high expectations,"I'd come to work on time, told what my duties were for my shift, and instantly get to work on it. I would mainly sweep certain areas of the store, mop the same areas, sometimes buff the floors. The manager(s) would be straight forward with me about certain issues, but would go to my superior for any issues about my work. The hardest part of the job was how my body would be by the end of the shift. Some days were easier then others. I couldn't handle the pain I experienced and there was no easy way for me to ease it, along with no care from the manager(s).

Not a fan of Walmart,Walmart is just not the place to work. They work employees hard and pull employees out of their specific areas off their specific tasks to get other things done and when they don't get their work done management complains about employees. Also management will have hourly employees work 10 hours on a given day and tell them they can keep the extra hours but then end up cutting them at end of week taking away any potential overtime. Also will make employees take extra long lunch periods so that they don't go over 40 hours.,2,Former Employee,Bakery Manager/ Asset Protection ,"Waxahachie, TX",3/4/19,2019,3,4

Bad Management,If your not friends with management you wont get anywhere honestly. Management is terrible and they only worry about their bonuses. They cut hours often and wont even tell you a valid reason why. There is no overtime available but when it is it's basically like they are forcing you to stay over. They changed the point system so its really stupid how fast you get fired for being sick basically. The new point system is costing them more than before.I still only work here until i can find something else stable and that pays more.,1,Current Employee,Money Center Associate ,"Kansas City, MO",3/4/19,2019,3,4

Interesting to say the least,"I can't say much other than my time here has been up and down. I feel like I'm just sputtering in place with nowhere to go.

Its Walmart,"This job is not for everybody. At the store I work at,  I would come into work and run around to find a manger to tell me where to go or what to do. Most of the CSM's were immature and disrespectful, the only reason they become mangers is become of favoritism. With that said the customers were the most enjoyable part of my day but the lack of professionalism and good mangers was the reason behind me leaving.

fun but inadequate managerial positions,"I did not like dealing with the managers there because they actually played the favoritism card a lot.

walmart is okay,A typical day would involve me stocking new product that came into the store. You also have to provide customer service usually just letting someone no what isle a product is in.

Wouldn’t recommend long term,"Where do I start? Walmart can be different depending on store. At the end of the day their main focus is money! Not customer service, not employees, not safety but money. Managers are stress and overworked which they will tend to take out on you their associates.

Mediocre but has job security,"While working here, you don't even really see the managers, as the supervisors report all information upwards.

Some employees regularly clocked in 15 minutes early every day so they could be told to leave an hour early on Friday. Nobody seemed concerned about that.  When it comes to the annual review, you will always perform ""average"" or worse so that they are only obligated to give you the minimum raise. I found this particularly ironic because I remember the store having a party in the back to celebrate exceptional performance on the full year I worked. The party was on a day when we were unloading 2 extra trucks, of course._x000D__x000D_I never felt like my job was at risk, but that was because I was barely working above minimum wage.

Hard to move up even after being there for 2years,"Overall it’s decent. My department is one of the hardest working in the whole store and we get paid the least. Our supervisors are not the best, and nothing is done with common sense. The best part of the job is the people the work with me. A typical day for me would be set up for the truck, unload it which could take from 2 to 5 hours depending on how big it is. Then we finally go to lunch when it’s done. When we get back from lunch we stock the freight that we unloaded.

Terrible place to work from the top to the bottom,"I’ve seen amazing managers there for YEARS and position just get taken away and forced out for no reason other than getting rid of the position.  No compassion for employees whatsoever and behind closed doors none for the customers either.  Unachievable goals and expectations (outside of retail norms), no job security, poor communication, terrible work environment, and just an overall terrible place to work.

Typical Retail Environment,"Typically for people who like people and enjoy working or starting out in retail environments. Working hours always include weekends and the duties have a gray area. Employees are expected to help in other areas during peak times and can limit the time spent in their trained assigned departments. This cross training philosophy is helpful, but can exceed limitations of the departments. The perimeters the employee is expected to fill is all based on demand basis with all the department managers in charge and how well they communicate with one another. This process gets very confusing during holiday peak times.",4,Former Employee,Sporting Goods Associate ,"Hickory Creek, TX",3/3/19,2019,3,3

Typical day,"The typical day included being forced to rush through calls to reduce wait times and instead give them a ticket to fix later. If the call was over 2 minutes or wasnt able to be fixed while taking another call you were expected to get to it later regardless of urgency. In theory thats fine until you realize that the calls and issues never stop for a team of less than 20 managing over 180,000 devices that all can have issues and there is never downtime to work on the tickets themselves.",3,Former Employee,Technician III ,"Bentonville, AR",3/3/19,2019,3,3

Stay hydrated!,"In a non climate control warehouse you need to stay hydrated. Some managers are fair, others don’t care if you like your job or not. You’re there to make production and numbers and they don’t care to hear your excuses. There’s always new policies being made that you are unaware of until the last minute. Forget asking for time off, they go by seniority. It’s either kill or be killed with this company and the turnover rate is extremely HIGH!! Senior associates are unhappy and they don’t care for change. They really do go by the good ole boy system. If you’re not afraid of hard work and being criticized then this is the job for you. Give 150% and they’ll want 200% from you. Good luck if you decide to work for someone who addresses you as a number and not a person!! Felt like I was an inmate most of the time and not an employee.

Fast paced job,Poor managment. They dont care about your home life or anything about you. They dont care how hard you work or respect your opinion. All they want is a robot that will do what they say when they say it and don't care if you work yourself into the ground.

Walmart employees are similiar to Zombies,"Walmart likes to use the term Associate, but it is a misnomer.  'Employee' means 'someone who works for a company. 'Associate' means 'someone who works with a team in a cooperative vain. I took the job as a self-check host as a last resort. As a septuagenarian living on Social Security Walmart was the only company that would hire me. It was fine until management changed. The new management team lacks compassion. When our manager got promoted and a new manager had yet to be hired an assistant manager was made ""acting manager."" She has no compassion, cares little about the employees and has no people skills. As acting manager she even went so far as to relieve a CSM who has over 15 years with the company of her position. The CSM was on temp. disability. When she reported to work she was informed by the AM that she had been reassigned to lesser position with less pay. The AM did not have the authority to do this, nor did she have the courtesy to contact the CSM. Fortunately the CSM in question was able to transfer to the store where our former manager is now the manager and got her job back. Since new management has taken over people are wanting out. There has been a huge exodus. Those of us who are still there are miserable. As for honoring hours of availability forms FORGET IT. They have yet to honor the hours that I've requested and I've filled out three of them in the year and a half I've been there. The AM lied to the HR person and said I never filled out one although there was a witness to it.

Decent pay/Very physical LOTS of lifting,"HEAVY LIFTING! Many orders of huge bags of dog food, large cases of water and heavy cans of soda. You are constantly ""staging"" them which means getting them ready for pick up. I'm 5'5"" but Wal-Mart has a cart you stack so high that I had to constantly lift these items over my head ALL day. Then you deliver them to the customer who usually sits in thier car like royalty texting while you are unloading thier heavy items in thier car sometimes in the rain. About 1/3 will help you load,  a third will sit in the car and 1/3 t(the worst) will stand beside you and monitor how you load and tell you where they want things. Pay decent. 11/hour. Most likely you'll work ALL weekend and a lot of afternoon shifts that eat up your day. Managemient is decent but needs to control some of the many cussing/bullying workers that are back there. That seems to be the norm back there  One employee was constantly yelling at the others and it was constantly overlooked like she was a pet.",3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Associate ,"Florence, AL",3/3/19,2019,3,3

My Experience Here,"I work at a smaller Walmart, it is not a bad job. The people are very nice and the job has good hours (I work in the Pharmacy).

Expect Nothing and You Won't Be Disappointed,"Some associates genuinely love Walmart, and most of those are people who never worked anywhere else.  Retail is retail, and expect the usual pros and cons concerning work requirements and conditions. However, Walmart as a corporation is moving away from the old traditional retail model and more toward an automated online presence. They are eliminating or combining many traditional retail positions, so don't be surprised if your job becomes drastically different in focus, pay, and hours than what you signed up for. Some locations are bearable because of decent managers and staff, but I've worked at one Walmart that was a hotbed of bullying and favoritism (especially with relatives that while they did not work directly""under"" one another, they certainly worked WITH one another at the same job and same shift).",1,Former Employee,Cashier / Customer Service Rep ,"Overland Park, KS",3/2/19,2019,3,2

The people you directly work with are like a second family,"They micro manage to the extent of being counterproductive. They work salary to the extreme, overworked and set up to fail. Expectations are way to high for anyone to ever accomplish. Working retail is hard enough and they make it much worse by not having management schedules done so you can plan around your work or they do not give you alternative time off for your family to spend together during holiday seasons.

Unbearable,"I feel myself hiding and alert like prey as soon as I clock-in cause I do not want to be annoyed by management, that all they do is criticize, backstab, and want to overwork you, I ignore them but the fact that every day I work I'm pestered, makes me upset to have to go in the next morning. If you have a coworker who is a try hard and complies with them, they want everyone to work like that one coworker. I found my coworkers applying to another job while working that is how bad the job is. Getting home sore and out of energy every day is not fun, I'm sore daily, I unsubscribed my gym membership cause I get enough exercise every week. I already have getting a bachelor's as a goal, but working there inspires me more to finish college so I do not have to work these types of jobs for the rest of my life.",1,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",3/2/19,2019,3,2
Worst Walmart I've ever been in,"I'm not proud to be a Walmart associate like all the training videos say you should. This place is a MESS.

Workplace was fun and challenging,"Working for Walmart was fun and not overly stressful, especially working for the Overnight Maintenance crew.

Walmart Review,"I feel that the Department Manager position is one of the most difficult positions in the store. DM's do not get the credit nor pay they deserve.

I feel in order to become an assistant you should have to be a DM, or at least have knowledge of the position.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Reno, NV",3/2/19,2019,3,2
"Keeps you busy, at the cost of your health",Not a place I would ever recommend someone to work at unless they're truly desperate for money as they wages are very competitive. The management only cares about their numbers and will work you to the bone with mandatory 50 hour weeks to meet they're goals with as little as staffing as possible. They're the embodiment of what's wrong with our current corporate work culture.,1,Former Employee,Freight Handler ,"Franklin County, OH",3/1/19,2019,3,1

"Good pay, Extremely Hard work","The job itself would have been easy, but the night and day shifts wouldnt communicate with each other, so night shift would end up leaving thier supplies in the wrong areas, or reversing changes made on day shift, only for day shift to reverse those changes again. A lot of work mainly repeating yourself, while the managers argued on who's vision is better. The pay is good, paid lunch and breaks too, but not worth all the hassle of aching back, feet, and head.",2,Former Employee,REMODEL ASSOCIATE ,"Athens, TN",3/1/19,2019,3,1

Horrible,"Enjoyed the customers and other associates. Management was HORRIBLE to say the least. They treat associates with such disrespect and constantly yelling at associates, even in front of customers, very unprofessional. Pay was good but not worth the stress of dealing with management. Seen countless associates get passed up on promotions because management didn't like them. Had nothing to do with if they were qualified or not. Best term I heard out there from a fellow associate is that management uses associates and department managers as whipping posts. Truest statement I'd heard out there. Would never work there again.",1,Former Employee,Associate ,"Marion, IN",3/1/19,2019,3,1

Everything is constantly criticized and or changed.,1,Current Employee,Cap Team 1 Associate ,"Parkersburg, WV",3/1/19,2019,3,1
Favoritism and lack of flexibility,I worked part time and worked the 5-10 pm but was usually there until 11 pm or 12 am. The management was very biased and would give the easiest jobs and best hours to their favorite employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance family obligations and work.

That said the help given to some areas at all times and they experience little stress.",4,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Redwood Falls, MN",3/1/19,2019,3,1
Management will have it in for you,"It wont matter how hard you work, or even how safely you work. The store i pushed carts at, fired me over a row of carts lost control due to high winds. The high winds 45mph to 60mph gusts. Pushed the row out at the center nearly hitting a car that was parked in front of the garage we put them into. Keep a note that cards SHOULDNT be parked in a no parking zone to start. The same manager also coached me over petty things like phone use (Even when the lot was entirely clean.)

The managers suck and are really rude. They don't care about the employees. You are just a number and a body to fill a spot. They do nothing for their long term employees yet want good publicity for starting pay at $11 an hour. This will NEVER be a career no matter how hard they try to act like it is. They expect 1 person to do the work of many. The insurance is pure garbage might as well not even have insurance. Personal and sick time accrued prior to the bump to $11 an hour was made nearly impossible to use.

Sucks!!,Management have favorites so if you kiss butt that’s the place to work. They didn’t allow over time only when they wanted or shall I say needed you. Lack of management having your back.

Horrible idea,Walmart is going down hill. You won’t get many hours unless you go by when they tell you they need you. If you have a life outside of Walmart forget about it. You can only work part time mostly then they will make you sign a contract of sorts of promising you little to no hours but if they have more to give then they will. They don’t give many days off then if you happen to call off they have points and if you go over in a certain time period you’ll get fired.

"It's a job, not the best, but can help out for a time","Working at walmart, you can definitely get by, depending on your position your paid well enough to live off the check just wouldn't be the most comfortable living as one can expect. How a typical day goes depends on your department and position. While I'm sure it depends on what store you work with, at my store I find myself wondering how we manage to hold things together sometimes. From basic maintenance on tools and equipment to paying attention to the associates, there are plenty of things that'll make you turn your head and arch a brow, but you can find that at almost any retail chain and other jobs in general. Unless you're really struggling, it's good enough to help pay the bills and even live somewhat decent if your wise with spending. It's possible to move up and advance, but that often times takes you transfering to other stores and being placed in an area where your work can be recognized, lest you want to bring it to the attention of management.",3,Current Employee,Fresh Production Associate ,"Modesto, CA",2/28/19,2019,2,28

Hostile work environment with aggressive managers and supervisors.,"I worked for the Lincoln ME Walmart (04457) for little over a year. I started as Stockman(cart pusher) and halfway through the year shifted to maintenance (with no pay raise) which was arguably a much more stressful job. Covering for other stockman if they were just being slow and lazy (at the cost of my own duties going unattended.) Having absolutely zero communication with my supervisor. (So if day projects needed to be done I would never know until I was in trouble for not starting those tasks.)_x000D__x000D_ Around the same time I moved to Maintenance I had been given permanent part time, after that is when I started seeing the manager's as they really were. They would stand in front of the coolers all day and just yell over people to try and direct customers to other lines. One of them would threaten employees, swearing and getting violent. One supervisor(now manager) had even had multiple tantrums and scenes where he would actually throw and break the backroom merchandise. One time even hitting a female employee working in the backroom. Keep in mind this supervisor was never punished for these incidents. _x000D__x000D_As for the store itself, the entire place felt like a safety hazard. The backroom was always overfilled, with little to no room to maneuver. Especially with heavy lifting equipment such as the walking stacker. A large machine that aided in lifting pallets or uboats to the upperfloor and or shelving units. In the actual store itself there is a shelving unit used for stocking soda's and drinks on both sides. Just pulling a 2 liter off of this shelf would cause the entire structure - more...",1,Former Employee,Cart Associate/Maintenance ,"Lincoln, ME",2/28/19,2019,2,28
Hard to Move Up,"While working there, I pulled my back several times. They overfill pallets on every truck. The pallets are already breaking so it becomes even harder to use a manual jack. Management pulled you off of live freight constantly and they leave departments with no associates for more than half the day. The back rooms are constantly unorganized and dirty. Whenever you need to talk to management, they are never to be seen. It was hard to get anything done because someone always needed to pull you off of what you were working on to move you to make them look better. They don't work with you for attendance. If you get sick easily, they will terminate you without even talking to you. If you have ideas or anything that isn't the same as management, they will find the smallest things to yell at you for and give you points. The management is the issue at this Walmart. Also, they keep the employees that don't work and fire the ones that actually do their stuff. They also never talked about benefits to those who receive them.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Easton, PA",2/28/19,2019,2,28
Good if there is nothing better.,"Overall Walmart is not a terrible place to work. It can feel dragging at times, but if you find some like minded people and develope a good working relationship you can have fun and grow. Walmart is currently trying to compete with Amazon; so expect new and exciting opportunities. There are often opportunities to advance, but do note this is from the sometimes extreme turnover._x000D_Do note, the attendance policy is very harsh for people that take advantage of it.

Way to corprate ran. And no-one is relaxed,"There was way to many things wrong with Walmart for me to cover it in 150 characters but the biggest things are Walmart has 150 billion rules and getting 1 wrong will lead to a couching. For example I got relieved for scanning the things on the belt with the scanner. An assistant manager was walking by and told me that I could not due that, gave me a 5 minute talk about why I can't do that, and told me I needed to abort it and start over. Stood their and watched me until the next transaction was done. The customer even said that he was impressed in me and even noted that the 2 values where the same. But that's nothing compared to the time where a 9ish year old girl fell, hit her head went unconscious (and me being previously in scouts know what I'm doing) I immediately shut down my light, threw the sign on the belt, and told the customers to wait there, I circled around to help the girl. I checked her pulse, got someone to call a manager over (so they could call the police) I went to put her jacket under her head (so she wouldn't be resting her head on the hard ground) and got her legs elevated. Right then a manager passed me and signaled for me to stop helping this unconscious girl and I would have just ignored her and kept helping the girl but a customer walked by and claimed to be a nurse. She verified that everything I did was correct and took the next correct steps so I just believed her and a minute or so later the actual ambulance showed up.

Don't recommend,The people are the backbone of this company and they get treated like garbage and disregarded at every opportunity. Working here has been nothing short of unpleasant.,2,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Newton, NJ",2/27/19,2019,2,27
Not a company you should work for,"This company is all about how to make 600 billion dollar or more with a little help as possible and making you feel like your job is on line every minute your there or not. Walmart acts like they are going to go out of business next week if you don't execute the program they created when the program is not built for the real world and dose not take into account issues that they create like sending in to much freight that you don't have enough people to stock. They create there own guide and hours on how long they figure it should take a very fast work versus your everyday stocker how can't stock 100 case in 1 hour of house hold chemicals. There are visit that happen during the busiest times of the year like Christmas and they expect your store to be prefect, if not you will get written up or possibly terminated. They are constantly eliminating jobs and reducing total store hours. When you tell them that something is not working it take years for them to realize they were wrong but in that time frame good managers lose there jobs because of unrealistic goals and expectations. There is always the threat of retaliation if you go over your managers head to address an issue. I have seen store manager get fire within 3-6 months after going to home office about something they had a write up overturned. The pay is very good, the benefits are very good, the paid time off is very good, but its not worth being stressed 24  hours a day 7 days a week. You can't take a day off without having either the store or your boss call you, email you or text you. There is no work life balance at all. - more...",1,Current Employee,Store Manager ,"Chicago, IL",2/27/19,2019,2,27

A logistics store with no logistics. Management is not very good. They do not provide a good moral for the company. There is no appreciation for the work we do.

Even when I wanted to just burst out in tears from the stress. From stretching myself out so thin. From doing three people's jobs from call ins. Do not expect recognition for anything you do.

Yikes,"All of the stereotypes are true, and there is little good to say here._x000D_Everything about this store is dysfunctional. There is little incentive to move up, since entry-level overnight crew makes more than department managers.

All of the scheduling and other maintenance in the department is done by the assistant store managers, who are completely clueless._x000D_There are intermediates, between department managers and assistant store managers called zone managers (zms), who do the majority of the work throughout the store, and get paid very little. The zms position is seen as an intermediate between department and store management, but they are severely overworked and underpaid (and, this is coming from someone who wasn't even a zms or department manager)._x000D_It was just a train-wreck here...Every module was passed down from corporate, and they made no sense. They were clearly designed by someone who has never actually worked in a grocery store._x000D_For example, on our produce layouts, we would have regularly refrigerated items (even 'wet rack' items) e.g. kale, pre-pack salads right in front of the door on sale display in the middle of the southern California summer.

High turnover rate,"I started working for this company almost two years ago in the Bakery department as a cake decorator. The job training was not sufficient for the position, and the existing supervisor in the area was fired after only a month of my working there.  I enjoyed the job until I found out that the reason for high turn over in that department was due to the extreme unresolved conflict in the department between workers, which made for a rather explosive job environment that was extremely high stress and took a toll on my mental health. As such, I requested to be transferred out of the department and was given my choice of 3 other departments. However, Job safety is not a priority at this store, and I was repeatedly asked to perform unsafe lifting maneuvers as a stock associate, which injured my back only 2 weeks after being transferred. Due to the injury, I was unable to continue my job in that position and was offered a position as a cashier, which I took due to a promised advancement opportunity and further job training. However, said advancement is still pending approval and I have been in my current position nearly a year._x000D_In my time at this store, I have seen many new faces come and go in various departments. I haven't had the same manager for more than 6 months. Overall, I am very dissatisfied with my job, and the new attendance policy is not friendly to those with physical health concerns (which develop consistently at this location as a result of unsafe job practices), issues with transportation due to weather concerns, or small children at home who need care.",3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Aberdeen, SD",2/25/19,2019,2,25
