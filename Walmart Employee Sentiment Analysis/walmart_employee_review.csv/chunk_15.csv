Watch your back at this place.,This place likes to throw you into the fire with little to no training. they eventually will send you to a training store if you are in management but if you are an associate then you have to learn on the fly.

"Competitive Introductory Pay, Flexible working roles","Entry Level Employees start at $11/hr and receive 2% cost of living increases annually. I worked on the front-end (Cashier/Customer Service Desk) and my roles were fluid thanks to secondary job codes. If you volunteer for different roles Management will allow you to fill in should the need arise, which helps provide more variety in a given workday. However, Employee evaluations do not influence pay raises and only marginally assist in Department transfers. This leads to a culture where those who put in extra effort are paid the same as those who do the bare-minimum. Overall though, Front End management is flexible, fair, and competent.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/ Customer Service Desk Associate ,Florida,6/24/19,2019,6,24

Satisfying and Challenging place to work.,I have enjoyed all my positions within this company. Working in retail is not always easy.

Bad experience,"The service desk is very stressful—you have to practice restraint—and the work location I worked for was extremely ratchet and ghetto (Ferguson Road).

Walmart is good for flexibility but job is not worth the pay,Working at Walmart is good for people that are wanting to go to school because they are flexible to your schedule.  Depending on the store with the management can either put you in good positions or put you in a bind to where they do not care about you or your situation. If you want to get paid then you need to move up quickly but the pay for certain positions is not worth the hassle unless you go straight to assistant manager position.

Favoritism,"As sad as it sounds, Walmart isn’t the best place to work. Operations managers constantly bringing change, coming up with new rules, changing the rules, switching managers to different shifts...it was terrible! They dont know what they want for their own facility! SAD! Lots of associates were under appreciated. Associates having relations with managers, even HR. Proves how unethical they are. Work would get slow and yet wanted all associates to meet a rate like it was so easy. Easy work gets assigned to managers favorites. Pathetic work environment if you ask me. You’re late from break by 1 minute and they accuse you of stealing company time.

A new location which had a couple kinks,"The typical day consisted of engaging in group stretching and a little speech. Afterwards we went to the computer to see where we were placed for the day. The management of the workplace needed work because one shift's unorganized work caused delays for our shift. This made the managers (four managers at that time) stressed and had to stay late.

Ever Changing Company,I have been with Wal-Mart for almost 11 years. Worked in several areas of the store. Been the Claims Supervisor for 3 years. The company as a whole is changing everyday.

Good job for kids starting out.,"I wouldn't recommend working here to my enemy. If you're just starting out and it's your first job it's great $11 an hour to stand around and talk on your phone. But if you've been here for any length of time there's no compensation for the new starting wages of Associates which breeds discontent amongst anyone who's worked there for a year or two or more. And because of that $11 starting wage they rarely hire full-time Associates. If you've got a good store manager then day today would probably be all right. But I don't. It's very stressful, I always feel threatened about losing my job, they ask you to do tasks but they have no comprehension of what it entails, the processes are relatively new. I believe the company is there to make rich people richer, certainly not the values that it once had especially as far as treatment of their employees.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Choctaw, OK",6/22/19,2019,6,22

It was a mixed bag,"I worked for the company for about six and a half years and officially in at least five different positions in four different store. I did some fresh area, entertainment, overnight, and front end, so I got to see a lot of different things going on in the general operation of a store. I liked the job(s) itself, even enjoyed the various customers, but I had a real mix of managers. Some good, some poor, and some with very little training. I learned how to adapt to various customer situations, how to  efficiently train and care for teams of people under my supervision, and all the small little details in between. The general culture of the place was a lot of people doing as minimum as possible  because store level managers were usually poor in how they interacted with people, or the store level managers having people work literally four to five different people's jobs and getting upset when all the needed daily work isn't done.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"San Antonio, TX",6/22/19,2019,6,22
Stressful and being pulled all over the place,The usual night at walmart consists of being confused and being understaffed upfront because no one knew how to schedule or do work. I mean come on!

I learned how to run a department as well as improving my sales skills and customer service. As well as being completely flexible in working wherever management needed me to work.

Quick to blame, slow to accept blame, they passed the buck down to the lowest rung to save their own hides.  If you find yourself with managers who will listen and communicate, you can easily make Walmart a career for life.  If you have self-serving managers(like I did) then you'll be hard pressed to choose between a decent wage and literally anything else.",4,Former Employee,Produce Sales Associated ,"Greenville, NC",6/21/19,2019,6,21
Productive Number Pushers who dont care about associates.,Been with rhe compnay 13yrs. Its a seniority based company. Top out is currently a little over $20/hr. When I started it was hard work bit paid good and was a fun place. That's not rhe case anymore. Now it's all about the numbers. Insurance gets worse every year. Sick time can only be used for your family members. Recently lowered our vacation time. It's not the place it used to be. Ive watched 20+ yr associates walk out the door because of the place it has become. They constantly give people errors for things they can't control. It's just not the same company it used to be. _x000D_Work is hard but manageable if you have any work ethic.,3,Current Employee,RSR Lift Driver ,"Midway, TN",6/21/19,2019,6,21

They know I have 2 kids that I have to support 100% on my own. _x000D_And instead they cut all the hours of the people who have been there for a year-10 years, and give those hours to the new kids who still live off mommy and daddy.",1,Current Employee,Stocker/Customer Service ,"Fayetteville, AR",6/21/19,2019,6,21

Got let go,Got fired based on heresy. The managers are dumber than doorknobs and like who they like unlike a hard worker like myself who gave them 4 years of my time. Never stole anything never stole time like so many of my coworkers and yet I was left to find a better job whi h was the best solution ever. Walmart is the most racist and worst place in history to work. It is a oerfect starter for kids graduating high school. Most management was highly unqualified. 100 cashiers in the building only 1 on register because the others get away with hiding in the breakroom. If you are looking for a professional starter job do not start here. This job made me hate customer service and i became the most meanest person on inside and out never was in a good mood. The abuse I insured over the years I am happy it is over. This job is not for african Americans so save your time.  They also lied on my termination papers and denied me and my family unemployment.

"Fast paced, Enjoyable work environment.","The work day, depending on what time you got to work, was relatively fast paced. There were slow times, but we made up for it by finding other things to attend to. I learned how to work in a fast and efficient manner. I also learned to pace myself and try not to let mistakes frustrate you. The management was very attentive and were available to answer questions when they were asked. There may have been some times where there was a bit of a wait, but that is mainly due to many problems happening all at once. My co-workers were so amazing to work with. They were very friendly and would open up and welcome you into their circle if you so chose to be apart of it.  The hardest part of the job was when we would have many people come in all at once. The lines would get backed up and it felt as it would never end. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers, and seeing them come in nearly every week and have them stop by and say ""Hello"" while you are working. I would most definitely want to work there again.",4,Former Employee,CASHIER WALMART ,"Wenatchee, WA",6/21/19,2019,6,21
Poor upper management,"11/hr minimum is nice, but overall it's just not a great environment. Upper management is terrible.

My Experience May Not Be Yours,"It seems I'm one of the few people online that actually had a good time working at Walmart.  My job duties were always simple matters of ""go here do this"" and not much else so it really wasn't difficult at all. My managers and supervisors were competent and very friendly which is definitely a positive. Ultimately the store I worked at was the ideal retail job, however I did a two week transfer to help out another store and it was the exact opposite. No one knew what they were doing and there was no structure or order to be found anywhere.",3,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate / Unloader ,"Kunia, HI",6/21/19,2019,6,21
Worst job I’ve had,I didn’t care working for Walmart. We were understaffed all the time and my managers didn’t care they just wanted js to work with what we had which again was never enough.

Meh its not bad,"Depends on the store you work at, first management crew was great, they moved on to bigger things, and now were stuck with the 3 stooges. The pros i would say are better pay than most, and if you truly excel at your job, advancement isn't impossible. Benefits aren't the best, not until you advance up the ladder more, which sucks in my opinion. You need thick skin period, you will see first hand what the term moron really means, and that covers from the customers you'll encounter, to management you'll have to deal with, to the very people you work with and have to see everyday.",3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Ocala, FL",6/21/19,2019,6,21

They constantly talk about the ""One Best Way"" but refuse to follow it and few know it.  Things are constantly changing not because the company is evolving but management has no clue what they're doing.  There seems to be no real reward for the good performers and no real encouragement for the poor performers.

Walmart Life,My first real job was working for the Walmart company and getting a chance to really understand what it means to provide proper customer service no matter what.

Stressful and inconsistent,"Walmart is trying to change to stay Relevant to today’s market. The problem arises when the store management team doesn’t make changes needed to follow these changes. The processes are step before them, the expectations are there, but then they get upset when they’re not meeting them.

Can be fun sometimes family oriented,Working in retail in general is not the greatest.  The pay is good benifits are ok. They only care about the bottom line. The attendance policy is AWFUL. 1 time flu or if you have children very easy to get terminated.

This is typically what most personal shoppers do. The hardest part of the job is navigating the store when it is full. The environment is enjoyable, but the culture resolves around numbers.

Worked in worse places but have worked in better ones as well.,Hibbing Walmart isn't the best example of how Walmart should be running their stores. The actual Store Manager is around... but isn't readily available. Shouldn't take over a week for an open door meeting to be had once it is requested. The lady in HR tends to be the one that runs everything it seems. The ASM's are readily available for the most part but they are constantly swamped with work. They play favorites and tend to avoid everything that doesn't fall under their areas unless absolutely necessary. It's obvious that most of management sees the hourly staff as incapable and tends to treat them as such... if not just completely ignore them. They really need to either replace or retrain in more than a couple of cases. There is more than a bit of clique type drama going on and it isn't uncommon for attitudes to be thrown. Now that does not pertain to the whole store... there are some very wonderful people that have been there for a long time working there as well. And those are the ones that made working for the year I was there worth it. I wouldn't exactly recommend it to anyone that doesn't have a thick skin or a pressing need.,2,Former Employee,Multiple positions ,"Hibbing, MN",6/19/19,2019,6,19

Productive but poor management,I usually start my day at 4am get my equipment get my cart ready and start picking items that are dropped into our system. From my point on management some know what they are doing and how to do it they have been with the company the longest as for the others they do things in their own way thinking its better for the company. the hardest part of the job is the management your working on a project one manager says change it the other says put it back sometimes it can get overwhelming with freight and trying to keep up with no help just doing projects on your own. The most enjoyable part of it is your co-workers you can help each other with the projects and freight when needed but most of the time it depends on who is at your store that day some days are better then others but it usually is not all that bad depending on the day.,3,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Las Cruces, NM",6/19/19,2019,6,19

It's okay,"Walmart has been my life for about 5 years, my mother in law lives, breathes and will most likely be buried in a Wal-Mart casket. My wife is the same way. However I can not get behind the idea that Wal-Mart is a good company to work for, yes it has a lot of benefits but the management is the worst part about the job, of course it could just be the store I'm working in. It's very hard to get promoted even into the smaller promotions like Department Manager or Support Manager. I had been promised multiple times that I will be promoted or considered for the position if I did a bunch of favors for management like pick up extra work or shifts or helped out other departments, but when it came down to the interview process, I never received one. They always had someone to fill the position from their back pocket as if they had previously talked about it months in advance. Now I'm not lazy by any means, I work my butt off for this company but I can't but feel like I'm slowly losing motivation and confidence in my work because of all the tricks, the lies and deceit thst managers will throw at you just so they don't have to do their job and can get you to do it instead. I've taken the management assesments multiple times to be accepted as a candidate for promotion. Been told by the higher ups when they visited the store that I needed a promotion.

The managers told them THREE days before their bonuses were supposed to be payed to them that they wouldn’t not be receiving their bonuses that year. 10,000 dollars can mean a lot to a family that is counting on money they have worked for and that has been promised to them. This company should be shut down. Please for the rights of all customers DO NOT show them your receipt at the door. It is illegal for them to detain you unless they have contacted the police.

Decent management and great environment.,"The managers were pretty decent. One of them wasn’t great but another one was extremely nice and encouraging. 401k plan, options to buy stock after working for a certain period of time. Only issue I had while working there is I was never given a store tour, which is pretty important when it’s part of your job to help with customer carry-outs. For example, I needed to go to where the grills were being sold at once in order to help load a grill up for a customer, and I wondered around the place for 10 minutes desperately trying to find where the grills were at. It was embarrassing. But that’s what happens when they don’t give you a store tour and you have no idea where specific things are.

"Okay company, slowly going down the tubes.","Worked at Wal-Mart for ten years. Promised the world when hired. As each milestone was reached, policies ""changed"" (for the worse).

Company doesn’t care about their employees.,"I have been at Walmart for over fifteen years. I have been the department manager for two departments for fourteen of those years. A couple months ago, they came in and told us we were no longer department managers. They were dividing us into three groups. Leads, academy trainers and sales associates. I was offered an academy trainer position on nights for the same pay. I can’t work nights, so I declined. They told me I would have to see what positions were left after everyone else was offered their positions. This took over a month waiting to see if I still had a job or not. They finally called me back to tell me I would be a sales associate on days if I signed consent to a ten percent wage deduction. I had no choice but to sign it. Now, I am doing everything in six departments I was doing before in two without the pay. I have to work every weekend and my days off are split up. I’ve always been an asset to this company. The store managers and assistants have always given me great evaluations, my attendance is outstanding, the customers love me, but now I feel very bitter and can’t wait to leave this company. The people they picked to be leads were undeserving and received a big pay increase. Now, the departments I used to run look horrible, everyone is lost in other departments, so customers are getting upset because no one knows anything. Everyone is unhappy now and going in there every day is now a challenge.",1,Current Employee,OTC Department Manager/Pharmacy Technician ,"Macon, MO",6/19/19,2019,6,19

A place where employees are treated like expendable garbage and they take it out on one another and are always miserable,"Wal-mart is full of cliques. Divide and conquer is alive and well there. The management team is full of friends that hang out in and out of work with little to no integrity towards things like conflict of interest. If you're not friends with the management, you have little chance of joining management because they will feel like you're trying to compete with them and cause them problems. _x000D__x000D_Once you've shown that you are competent enough to do the job of a single person, they'll keep adding more and more work until you're doing the job of about 3 or more people.

horrible management,worked for walmart for 3 years was promised a lead position and never got it. Instead they would make me lead as a regular associate but not pay me for it. Lots of favoritism doesn't matter how hard you work you wont get promoted for that. People were getting promoted to manager after 5 months of working there and they were not qualified to properly do the job. So if you work hard do not work here you will never go anywhere with this company. If your a kiss butt though this job is perfect for you management feeds on that.

Terrible place to work,"Walmart is a terrible place to work . They don’t care about their employees or their availability . Will stick you with 1-10 shifts all of the time and you will hardly EVER work in the department that they hired you for . You will be expected to complete everyone else’s work and get in trouble if you don’t complete yours as well. I work in electronics and they will make me go to different departments all of the time and sometime even have me outside watering plants . Takes 6 months to receive any benefits , 3 months to receive a 10% discount and all of the health care benefits and maternity leave are only for full time employees. They will give you full time work schedule and put you in the system as part time so that you won’t receive the benefits .They have a 5 point system to where you can only miss 5 days every 6 months or you will get fired , NO EXCEPTIONS , you get 1/2 point for being late 3 points for no call, no show & 2 points for calling off on a key event date.  All of the managers are very rude and do not know how to behave themselves in a professional manner . They also don’t honor any of your requests for time off . Walmart is overall a terrible place to work . If I had to rate them it would be 0/10 and I would NOT recommend working here .",1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Harahan, LA",6/17/19,2019,6,17

It is difficult working at Walmart because of the managers, understaffing, co-workers, and general disregard for entry level associates. You will get occurances for being a second late clocking in or coming back from break. They will work you to death, if you decide to work there. All managers are know it alls and won't address complaints unless you open door them.

Borderline breaches to ADA.,"Highly political, discouraging growth even when you show you are willing to go the extra mile. It will drain you. If you have any condition or injury, get documented immediately and have specialists cover all possible incidents that might come up. It doesn't matter if you are missing a foot, you will be given ""productivity"" coachings/discussions for not moving relatively fast enough. Customer service is no longer priority despite what is loudly proclaimed, boxes are. They want you to find a way to move on if any customer takes more than a couple minutes. It's a policy that will be the downfall of the company, they will continue to lose technical-minded and creative thinkers. Asset Protection is turned on employees to create ""productivity cases"" when the employee is disliked by management for any reason. I have been accused of taking breaks too long on a day of the week I haven't worked in 3 years. I didn't believe the warnings of why people were quitting, now I have stayed long enough to see why. After 4 raises, 3 have been negated by increased base pay, so it's the equivalent of having worked here a single year. Essentially, you work under siege for a pittance, slowly having your enthusiasm eaten away and replaced by bitterness til it's merely the connections you have made, pure stubbornness, and that subsequent employers wouldn't quite understand the nature of the job place if you just walked out. So you stay, grit your teeth with pride, and fill out a resume to find a place to put your skills to use. That is growth at Walmart, realizing you shouldn't be there.",1,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Salem, MO",6/17/19,2019,6,17

"Hi stress job, not worth the money","Part of your experience as a tech will depend on your team and on the pharmacists that run your pharmacy. In my experience, our pharmacy manager is an emotionally and verbally abusive pharmacist making our lives very difficult. She does have good days. So when going to work, you never know if you're getting Jekyll or Hyde, which actually makes the stress worse.  One employee is the most common victim of her abuse and complained to management several times, but nothing got done. Now the employee has a bad review (saying she's not a team player, which is not true), so she cannot ask to be transferred.  All other pharmacists are great to work with and ready to answer question. As far as working for Walmart, as a part time employee you get no benefits, you incur pto and much slower rate than full timers (it takes me about 40 hours of work to earn 1 hour, while ft employee achieves that in about 18!). We are as well short staffed. And if our customer service is not great (which is what happens when we are short staffed and cannot fill orders on time), Walmart takes more hours from us!!!!! It's like Walmart is shooting us in the foot. Our pharmacy is very busy, extremely fast paced and stressful. I did fill in in a different pharmacy, which is slow and relaxing, with nice happy customers. If I worked there full time, my review would likely be very different. So before accepting your position, find out how busy the place is. We have required training we have to do during work hours, but we don't have any time to do it, as we're so busy.

Had I not been Injured,"When I first started at Walmart I worked on the deli department. It was great. Fast paced, lots to learn about meats and cheeses. How to make their deli salads, sandwiches etc. However, when the manager change came and it’s done every quarter every assistant manager is changed to a different department, it was awful. I had this one manager who absolutely disliked me. I could never figure out why. So I switched to cashiering. I loved it!_x000D__x000D__x000D_I knew most of the produce codes I could do 800 items an hour and I was even speedy with the ad matching (when they were doing it). On a father’s days weekend I tore my rotator cuff after lifting case after case of water. After a month it didn’t get better I was having to do physical therapy and it still didn’t get better. During this time I couldn’t be on a register because of my injury so I was forced to be a door greeter. The manager that didn’t like me was completely disrespectful to me. _x000D__x000D_I couldn’t stand there with my arm dangling because it hurt so bad. So I had to put it in my pocket or across my chest and so on.  She would constantly tell me I have to stand with my arm dangling. When I told that that hurt she told me “we’ll go get a sling for it then.” If you have ever had a rotator cuff injury you know that putting your arm in a sling where it is in a constant resting position is terrible for your healing. The rotator cuff yes needed to heal but it has to do with movement otherwise when your muscle heals you will get what is known as “ice shoulder” and that is when your muscle become hard to move because of how it healed.

Working at Walmart,"I have worked at Walmart on and off for 20 plus years during different areas in my life .They are usually fairly easy to come back to as they are always hiring due to high turn over rates. Working at Walmart ,I usually enjoyed as I truly like working with and helping people. Working for Walmart is a whole different thing. You were able to put what hours you were available, but management would remind you over and over that you may not get any shifts if you didn't have open availability. This can be very hard for a single mother or father. Your hours are not always consistent and during lower peak times you could be scheduled for only 2 days a week. Considering the cost of living right now and that you usually are only hired for part time, most employees had two jobs. You do not receive any insurance as a part time employee for at least a year and it is limited. They have a new absence policy that is confusing and not explained very well. Management is 80 percent of the time not available and if they are it is obvious they have other things they need to do besides answering your concerns. To be fair management is usually under a lot pressure from upper management but it is a terrible cycle of disrespect for a place that demands respect for the individual.",2,Former Employee,"SCH cashier, Asset Protection, Cap 2 ","Lampasas, TX",6/15/19,2019,6,15

Terrible Management,"Management for this company is an absolute joke. You'd think it would be a rumor that they only advance people to get rid of them, but it's absolutely true from what I've seen over my years of working for this company. I've seen people who scream an belittle employees get advanced to department manager because they have ""leadership skills"" and I've worked under store managers who walk over and ignore employees mid conversation. _x000D__x000D_Recently Walmart introduced a new attendance policy, and although it sounded like they meant well, it actually made things so much worse. Yes you have workers who abuse the attendance policy, but the part that makes things worse is management favoritism. There are workers who call off just because they can, and management would somehow override it because they're friends or know the worker. Then there are workers who either are legitimately sick all the time or cannot afford to send their kids to daycare (babysitter called off, is also sick, etc.) and Walmart won't cover them/management could care less because they don't like the coworker for whatever reason._x000D__x000D_Honestly, working for the company would probably be a lot better if they ever took hiring management much more seriously, but that will never happen since it has gotten worse over the years. Also with the amount of money this company makes, they could honestly pay their workers more or at least give pay incentives for workers who actually do their jobs._x000D__x000D_Overall this company is good for a first time job or if you're a student in school, but other than that, don't bother.

"Productive and a fast pace environment, also very friendly coworkers","Unloading trucks and sorting trucks and  stocking the products was a typical day at work for me. The supervisor would make two teams, one to Unload trucks and the other to stock the groceries. I learned how to be a team player, to adapt to fast pace environment and how to deal with different types of customer. Management at Walmart are very friendly and reasonable with a situation arises. Although managers are friendly, Managers sometimes would not approve PTO for their employees. The culture at Walmart varies a lot with age and ethnicity. The hardest part at work was to unload the general merchandise truck on a time watch and constantly being rushed. They believed that trucks should always be unloaded and sorted in under 2 hours no matter the load of the truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to help customers find their desired products and to learn how to handle hazardous situations in the work environment.",5,Former Employee,Truck Loader/Stock Person ,"Camby, IN",6/15/19,2019,6,15

Constantly Changing and Physically Demanding,"Over several years, I observed patterns in decreasing benefits that came disguised as wonderful new incentives with restructuring. Gone went profit sharing in exchange for 401K matches. Increasing have gone the cost of benefits at a rate equal to or greater than yearly pay increases with a demand of more transparency of the personal habits of employees such as smoking. Benefits come with a very high deductible and can cost a 3rd of your paycheck and have no copays. You pay the balance of your visits until the deductible is met.  The dental is good though. A daily routine exists for each position to provide role clarity and a path for success, but with what feels like a chronic condition of insufficient staffing, obstacles constantly obstruct that routine resulting in a daily sense of failure, such as a need to work multiple pallets of freight before working your area and then being called to ring register once you make it to your department. The needs of the business are forever pushed as greater than your own personal needs, and you will be expected to make many sacrifices at the expense of your family in the name of a paycheck. Expect to work every holiday and extra during those weeks, and if you don't like it there's the door. Nearly every two weeks, a scare occurs with the potential of a visit from someone important who seldom comes. With that scare, expect to be pushed beyond your physical capacity, to go home exhausted, to sleep during family time, and to stress eat your health away.",2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,Massachusetts,6/15/19,2019,6,15

It’s an eat or get eaten situation when you’re trying to work your way up. At lower levels, working there is still fine but the higher up you go, the more working there is worth it. But again, it’s not easy.",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Worcester, MA",6/14/19,2019,6,14
the workers make the job bearable,everynight is a battle between management and the associates suffer and its unfortunate. there is always a hostile work environment which is hard to accomplish your work because you have to pick one of the managers side just to keep your job,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"New Haven, CT",6/14/19,2019,6,14
In general you get out of it what you bring into it.,I find that a persons personal attitude they bring into the work place usually effects how others respond to them. While Honor Integrity and Commitment are very important it seems the abilities to inspire a positive attitude in others and to react to others in a similar positive way.,3,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Blackwell, OK",6/14/19,2019,6,14
Management is terrible,"The staff at Walmart are overworked and underpaid. At one point a staff member had to beg an assistant manager multiple times to be allowed to go home because they were feeling ill. Management is very hard to reach which is crazy consider how many are usually in the store. By the time you finally reach a management and tell them you need help or to converse with them, they blow you off. The store, 4358, is so highly understaffed, it's completely ridiculous the extra amount of work they throw onto current staff members. For example, I was working apparel. We usually had to people working night shift to clean, fold, and fix clothes in boys, girls, men's and ladies wear all while also operating the fitting rooms, sorting and hanging clothes there, and answer and directing calls. Given that my store was a superstore thats a lot of work for only 2 people and all jobs would rarely get done and we'd still be held accountable for it. Until Walmart shapes up their management and their lack of staff, and fix their 5 point over a course of 6 months system, their turnover rate will forever be high and they will constantly lose good hardworking workers.",1,Former Employee,Apparel and home softlines associate ,1606 s 72nd street Omaha Nebraska,6/14/19,2019,6,14
Good place to work depending on management,"Quality of management varies by store and department, but generally, Walmart is a fun place to work and has lots of opportunities for advancement.

It’s worth a shot...,The hours at Walmart are eh. I think its a really good job for students who don’t have to pay rent. I think Walmart could be better if they would stop with the favoritism and hire new management and associates who actually care about their customers.,5,Current Employee,Self Checkout Host ,Perry,6/14/19,2019,6,14

Difficult and Rewarding,The ASM role at Walmart is a tale of extremes. The easiest way to explain this is with a simple pro/con list._x000D__x000D_Pros - _x000D_The compensation from overhead looks good. Most Assistant Store Managers make between 50 and 60k per year. _x000D_Benefits are great. Healthcare/dental/vision/401k/stock/life insurance/discounts ara all included at reasonable rates_x000D_My team is very hard working. Some of the hardest working people I've ever met. _x000D_Community outreach. Walmart supports both its own associates and community with donations and fundraisers._x000D_Advancement - Store managers and market managers have very good compensation packages. Its the carrot that keeps you going._x000D__x000D_Cons-_x000D_Terrible work life balance. We are scheduled 50 hours a week but I seldom only work that. My average days are 10.5 - 11 hours and theres at least a 40% chance I'll work 12-14 each day._x000D_Compensation - as stated above from a far away perspective the compensation looks decent...but look at what I just wrote about hours and calculate the hourly rate. By that standard most of my associates that I am in charge of make more per hour than I do._x000D_Restructuring - As with most companies walmart is always looking to save money by restructuring and placing more work on the higher performing associates. I dont see a reduction in this any time soon...in fact I see it getting worse._x000D__x000D_Overall - Walmart is a stable company that shows fantastic profitability and that is exactly what a business is designed to do. The downside to all this is that as walmart continues to cut costs it will place more stress on the associates that remain. - more...,4,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Pittsburgh, PA",6/14/19,2019,6,14

"Things are changing at Walmart--some for good, some for not-so-good","Walmart has gotten rid of most of the old and/or disabled associates, one of the good things Walmart once stood for.  Many jobs have been cut deeply, leaving fewer people to give customer service. Most of the management seem good, but everyone worries about their jobs and the future changes.  Standing on your feet all day, every day, is tiring and painful for many, who are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their job.  We are expected to work when we are ill, or receive ""occurences"" if we stay home.  If you receive too many occurences in a 6-month period, you are fired. The computer training is great, but in real life, they expect cashiers to work very fast, leaving no time to look up and smile at people or do a good job packing the groceries.

Enjoyable job at Walmart,"I used to work at Walmart in Denver, CO and it was my favorite job. I was part of the Cap 1 team, also known as a stocking associate. It is a very easy job and the staff and management were great. Even though they say that this specific position is a fast pace job, you were able to go at your own pace as long as things got done of course. The pay was very good for my well being, and it was always nice getting a great check every two weeks, and I was working full time or more. There are plenty of opportunities to get overtime as well. They will either ask if you want to stay for an extra hour or two or you can also ask permission for overtime as a full time associate. Just don't take advantage of it. As a stocking associate, its definitely a very productive job. Especially if you're one of those who are into health and fitness, this gets you moving A LOT. And I mean, back and forth, pulling and pushing, climbing up and down stairs and more. You can definitely burn a lot of calories 💪 All in all, being a stocking associate is a very active and fun job.

The management will always choose the customer over you even if they know you are right to make themselves look better. I've never had a job where i was on a ""team"" and felt so alone in my life. As soon as you get to your one year mark which is how long it takes to recieve a pay increase and some other small things they will find a reason to write you up so you jave to wait another year. I was told by many, many customers that i was an amazing employee. I had customer's call my managers to let them know what a wonderful person i was and how hard of a worker i was just to never hear about it from management. I would never refer anyone to work here.

Amazing Part-Time Job,"While I was in school I worked at Walmart to have some extra spending money. The people I worked with were amazing and the managers were willing to work with you if you had a problem at work or with getting to work.

There is improvement to be made,The customers were sometimes very rude even when there wasnt a reason for there to be.

"Employees great, management sucks","I do not recommend working at Walmart Distribution Center in Gordonsville, Virginia.  The employees are fun to work with but management and the culture of the company is focused more on results than the employees welfare.  Turnover is high because you get written up for every little thing, which in turn kills morale.  A vast majority of the employees are walking on eggshells waiting for the next time they are written up.  Floor managers seem to be hired based off their tenure and not their leadership abilities.  Walmart doesn’t take the time to train their managers in becoming better at their jobs but instead teach them how to stare at a computer and find ways to write people up.  There is a very good reason why a dozen employees walked out of the job a short time ago.",1,Current Employee,Employee ,"Gordonsville, VA",6/13/19,2019,6,13

Management is poor,"I have never felt less like a human being as I did while working here. Management at all levels cause problems for associates. They were clueless about the departments being supervised and refused to help when we were understaffed. The understaffing came from upper management and seemed intentional. The Store manager would look for any reason to coach/write people up. For example, one guy got in trouble with the store manager for not being enthusiastic enough when acknowledging his presence. The pettiness and favoritism were disgusting. You as an associate are expected to take all kinds of disrespect without complaint. Some people could get away with doing nothing and if you brought this up with management they would just tell you to pick up the slack. There is not much room for promotion even for people eagerly pursuing such. If you get injured or sick and need to go to the doctor, good luck trying to keep the job. Even having documentation will not prevent you from getting punished by their rigid attendance policy. They offer a quarterly bonus but if you ever have to call out for any reason, you won't be getting it. Even those qualified randomly don't get their bonus. I think the only good experience I had working here was with the in-house HR department who really went out of their way to help the associates. _x000D__x000D_There is so much intelligence and talent in the associates but they are treated like garbage by people who don't even know what their jobs are.

Badly Understaffed with Poor Management,"You generally start your day by finishing the work the previous shifts did not complete. And then you spend the rest the day getting hassled by management for not completing your tasks on time. Once you move into salaried management Walmart has you on a hook. They can let you go at the drop of a hat. As a result salary management is often very unreasonable, sets ridiculous expectations, and treats their hourly associates poorly. Obviously there are exceptions to these examples but they are few and far between because of the pressure put on assistant managers and store managers by their superiors. On the plus side the friendships you make in difficult situations and in difficult jobs are often friendships that last a very long time.",3,Former Employee,CAP Supervisor ,"Ithaca, NY 14850",6/13/19,2019,6,13

"Lack of care from long term employee's, no team effort",I was losing my passion for my capabilities and pride I put into my job. You are not given time or help to do the job properly. There should have been 4 people for the job during the shift and several days a week only 1 person to do the job of 4. The supervisor and assist management didn't even try to uphold Walmart standards and policys. My immediate supervisor would go help other departments and leave me to work alone saying he trusted my capabilities and knowing 1 person could not do the job. Every time I questioned procedures or policy I was blown off and told other departments were priorty or it was someone else's job. They say you can transfer positions if available after 6 months but I was repeatedly told I could not transfer because they would not have anyone to do the job I was doing and were not going to hire in that position. I was told they had people working in other departments under maintenance title to up their quota and that left no availability to hire.,2,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Punta Gorda, FL",6/13/19,2019,6,13

A place to start but not remain,"Walmart was a wonderful company to start and earn my experience. But as life progressed i find that the salary Walmart pays is not enough to pay for the cost of living in my area. While they offered many benefits, they were not free of charge and would get discounted from my paycheck earning less. The work environment while being fun and educational, it began turning stressful due to lack of personal and decreased in hour, plus the cancellation of overtime really hurt our chances to earn more.

Not for everyone,"I think that this job would be okay for someone who enjoys mindless work. They either give you absolutely nothing to do, or way too much for you to finish in one day. The managers have no idea what they are doing or how to be managers. Instead of actually fixing problems they ""fix"" them and make them worse. For example, they will pull people into other departments to help finish their work, but then the people who get pulled to other departments get yelled at for not finishing their work. If you work at night, (6-11ish) good luck doing anything besides zoning for hours. They are constantly understaffed because people leave so often, the biggest reason being the new requirement to register train everyone. so if you don't want to ever work as a cashier, I wouldn't recommend working here. Managers will also blame everyone but themselves for anything that goes wrong. They also recently changed their attendance policy, so you can not call out as often anymore, but full time people who earn more paid time off can call out more.

"Walmart is a corporation that does not enforce its core values, and does not reward hard work.","During the interview and training process, one is led to believe that you will be entering a professional culture where individual merit is not only noticed, but rewarded.  Depending on the position into which you are hired, you may find yourself needing to work much harder than your peers if you want to meet your daily expectations.  You will also discover that the majority of your peers will leave messes behind that you have no choice but to clean, before you can even begin your assigned tasks.  This is a daily process:  Clean up after other, less responsible ""adults,"" (who will never be ""coached"" or fired for their latent inabilities) so that you can begin your responsibilities.  Cleaning up after others occurs throughout the day as well.  During the hiring process, they will tell these simple facts to no new employees.  It is also important to note that the longer you work there, the more you will come to realize that most of the management staff move and work slower than yourself.  You will find them slowly walking down the back hall together, talking about their favorite video games or their farms, wasting company time on a daily basis, all while being paid double or triple your wage.

Not all Walmart are the same.,"I have friends in New York and Washington who work for Walmart and get confused at the horror stories I told them from ours. it was understaffed to the point some employees who harass others would get away with it because management didn't want to lose labor. ASMs tried but would get shot down from general management. favoritism was and hear still rampant. Even heard general management go ""no they couldn't do that there like a mother to me"" when 4 people were fired one because they went to a funeral. The only real complaint I have from the actual work is it's hard to work when management is visibly panicking and yelling as if their life depended on it. I didn't hold it against them as I could see the panic was handed to them and not actually theirs.",3,Former Employee,Overnight stocker ,"Salida, CO",6/12/19,2019,6,12

Walmart is a mess I wouldn't even waste my time,So I've been at Walmart for about 4 months. They don't really put a lot of emphasis in training they train you a lot up on the computer and expect you to be fast with I'm putting product at up on the sales floor I'm overnight stocker is very intense the managers some of the people that been there for alone time most are nice but that's a few that are not nice. I've been in retail for almost 18 years I've never seen people be so not approachable. Corporate is always at this training so it's a train store you would expect that it will be more about making sure that you are prepared and that you know the right way to stock the store correctly. I wouldn't recommend Walmart cuz I've been seeing a lot of people being leaving my good friend that her foot ran over by the manager the manager did not rush her to the hospital like a manager should or had one of her assistants do it it was just terrible I don't recommend anyone to work at Walmart unless you really have to.

Patient satisfaction and well-being,Not enough structure and teamwork in order to take care and satisfy our customers needs.

Poor Management,"As with most companies your schedule is based on business need and can range from 4am to 7am start time for a day shift. Associates at certain pay grades were to be given one entire weekend off per month which does not happen. An associate would have to use their vacation time (PTO) requests to obtain a full weekend. Time off requests were frequently denied. Due to poorly managed staffing, associates are required to perform several tasks to cover areas that were simply not staffed. Management does not have time nor the desire to assist supervisors with any resolve to staffing issues and relies on them to ""take care of it"" resulting in many supervisors to be forced to step down, transfer or quit. Once employed you can rest assured you will be overwhelmed with daily tasks and nobody to assist you in completing them. Annual reviews do not include that you did not receive the much needed help, you will simply be given a poor review. Store Managers are not truthful and often their integrity is in question. Fraternization and nepotism are common.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Commerce, MI",6/11/19,2019,6,11

There were several things going on with my crew that made me uncompfortable and the mangement was aware of this and that is why i choise not to work there. they also promised advacedment and did not follow through with that. so yes very unimpressed with the mangement. however, i did learn a great deal about how a whearhouse is run and how to run a stocker crew. I am a quick learner and saw how to efficently get the truck unloaded and why task times are important.so My time there I learned a great deal. Im a great problem solver so when i see a problem I try to fix it to the best of my ablity. if i make a mistake tell me what i did and it wont happen agan.

Hyppocritical managers made job unbearable,"I unloaded truck for CAP 2 also knows as walmart's toilet. CAP 2 is universally disrespected by all departments in a walmart. I agreed to the job because I am a hard worker. Now to discuss the unsuspecting toddlers that they hire for CAP 2. they hire a lot of kids for this job. kids that have phones. kids that will not do their jobs, leading to many people not being able to get the day's work done. coworkers who stayed late to pick up slack for the kids that HAD to go home at around 9 usually had about 2 to 4 pallets of freight left to stock, meaning that if they breached the either allowed or denied overtime, the job would get done, but if you had no overtime allowed, you HAD to go home and deal with the consequences of not DOING YOUR JOB. Mind you this is after I would finish MY stocking with an hour to spare. but if you ever try to pick up any slack for anyone the responsibility would land solely on your shoulders and you would be at fault for the incomplete mess. Managers would frequently go through mental gymnastics trying to justify their reasoning for this, giving off some schpeel about teamwork as if we were connected through a hivemind. They also preach some garbage about RESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL, though they never practiced it. The other departments would frequently blame CAP 2 for any number of things and the managers would listen to them and discipline us over it also.

But what i did learn from working at walmart i learned at walmart was  how to look for numbers on the price tag and look at the last 3 and look at the one on the shelf and thats how you know that its the correct one and that working fast gets things done quicker and that some people just put things where ever so you have to reorganize everything to put them back in the right place and that if the shelfs are over load then you have to take it back to the back until there are more room.

Also my supervisor was a bully who had countless people fired over the years.

Terrible Management and Unorganized,"I was a part-time employee and was constantly given 38-39 hours a week so I was just under the full-time mark. They were aware I was a college student and had agreed to giving me only 20 hours a week, but I always got twice that. Management is unprofessional and loves to gossip. They do not actually work/help the cashiers much. Management overrides at the registers took FOREVER. They never scheduled me within my available times and would not let me take off for my college graduation. They constantly made me stay past my shift because they did not hire enough people for the day, as if that's my fault. Breaks would not be given most of the time, and lunches were always 1-2 hours late. After standing for 10 hours at a register, can't say I really appreciate that.

"Not the worst workplace, but corporate greed and ineptitude are abundant","It is clear that corporate leaders do not care about their associates as people. Every time a new policy or protocol is added, it seems like they want us to be overly, perpetually optimistic drones who can do more work than is humanly possible or reasonable if we want to keep good customer service. Coworkers get along nicely, but Walmart doesn't care where the money comes from as long as they can make as much as possible as fast as possible.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate/Cashier ,"La Porte, TX",6/10/19,2019,6,10
Competitive.,Walmart is a very competitive store to work for. The store is a fast pace with customer service as a priority.

Work place,I really loved working at Walmart because I got a long with Co works and the manager yes but the bad part is that they didn't give me my 40 hours and I can't be taken a Lyft for 3 hours a day all so they don't give you benefits until it's official that you are being scheduled 40 a week others then that no you don't get them,3,Former Employee,Cashier and Stocker ,"Sacramento, CA",6/10/19,2019,6,10
Great place to work.,The thing I like about Walmart they hire any race. The only thing I didn't like was the no call no show policy. Every quarter you get 3 chances to either call in. After that you will be fired. All though you should not call in some may have an emergency. There a lot of gossiping between departments which I didn't like. The managers seem to be in the middle of a lot of drama between employees.,4,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Pompano Beach, FL",6/10/19,2019,6,10

Overall not a pleasant company to work for.,Very disorganized. Schedule changes made verbally were not updated causing unfair negative occurrences on attendance record. Pay did not match the hard stressful work needed to be done. Training disorganized- I felt I was thrown into my position and taught myself by asking questions and observing. Mistakes could have been prevented if communication with supervisors had been better- almost obsolete. I never saw my direct supervisor. He was busy and never available for his department unfortunately.,3,Former Employee,Food Handler/Deli Clerk ,"Denver, CO",6/10/19,2019,6,10
Walmart is like a second home,"A typical day at Walmart is like a typical day at home, you have your job duties to do and some days can be really busy and some days can be slow. I would go to work, clock in, jump on a register and start checking out customers. I was usually on a register unless one of my managers needed me to tend to lawn & garden, do returns, get needed materials from the back of the store, or perform the new check out with me job. I've learned how to preform jobs other than what I was hired for and how to deal with different people in different ways. Management was good however like family there was some lack of communication between some managers. The workplace of Walmart was friendly almost family like, you had your good days and few bad days with co-workers but nothing that one co-worker couldn't help the other co-worker with. I believe my hardest part of my job at Walmart was learning how to control myself when it came to an over excited customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was the family like environment and being able to help people when they needed it.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"New Boston, OH",6/10/19,2019,6,10

Good People. Poor Management,"Working at Walmart is on the whole very good. As long as there are plenty of other associates, it doesn't get too bad. There were times that I was left alone to handle 4 busy departments, and things would become hectic and stressful. Especially since so many people come to the back stations to checkout. They don't understand that the people working on the floor have other jobs to do,and that we can get in trouble for not getting our other work done.",4,Former Employee,"Cashier, Sporting Goods Associate ","Ceres, CA",6/10/19,2019,6,10

Overall good place to work,"Have been through many management changes.  The current management is good. Although words of praise are common, raises are hard to come by.  Some of the employees care about their work; however, it is challenging to work with those who just get by the bare minimum.  The ones who care pick up the slack and work hard, but it appears those who just do the minimum are paid the same as those who care and work hard.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Aurora, CO",6/10/19,2019,6,10

"Extremely stressful, but enjoyable depending on fellow associates","Walmart is a good job to have. Although for many of us, being there for just two years seems to feel like ten years and you are worn out. Walmart works with its associates for hours they can work, unless it is the weekend, or holidays. Walmart does not do holiday pay, and if you are scheduled to work a holiday, and you cannot work you are severely penalized. Even if you request the holiday off six months in advance, you are more than likely to be expected and scheduled to work that shift._x000D_   Walmart takes full advantage of its associates. If you are training to be a CSM (Customer Service Manager), or are even a back up CSM (steps up as temporary CSM if none are scheduled, or one calls out) you do not receive any increase in pay. Just as if you are helping at the service desk, but not signed on with the service desk, you will not receive compensation for working at a higher paying position.",2,Former Employee,Cashier and Deli Associate ,"Jacksonville, FL",6/10/19,2019,6,10

"Decent Job, Could be better, could be a lot worse","I loved working in the Deli. My main job was helping customers with orders and preparing foods.

Worst Work Experience,"This was a terrible place to work during my time at this particular store. The store managers ignore the rights of their associates to the point of lying to them about it. I found myself demanding management call home office on multiple occasions to protect myself from them, and despite the fact that management know they must call home office when an associate requests it, many tried to fight my request, and others out right denied me. You will also find yourself regularly being asked to go against company policy, or commit OSHA violations. When you refuse, you will be penalized. If you do what you are asked to do and someone else notices the violation, you will take the fall for it, not the manager that instructed you to do it. Walmart also promises advancement from within, and priority for staff, but will regularly higher from without._x000D__x000D_Distribution Centers have a much better culture, and management that inform and support their associates.

Poor management,"They never had one person for management over the Front End. I never really knew who to turn to when I needed to request time off or other important matters.

Finally, when they tried to get a permanent person, that person went on a firing spree for all of the things prior people in management of the Front End left unsolved or messed up.

The pay was awful for the time/labor my team and I did. We were constantly understaffed and were expected to maintain the same workload, without any overtime. OT was a big no no. They made unions seem criminal during training. The deli area was in poor condition and was of poor design (no ventilation in backroom, tile floor under fryer was broken and unsanitary). I remember I ate a sub sandwich from our deli and later had to WORST food poisoning of my life. Also, they interviewed me three times and asked a huge amount of questions. About a month after I left, I found out that they lowered the number of questions to less than 5 and raised the pay by $1.55 (The state forced them to raise the min wage). I still wouldn't have stayed. This company doesn't care about its employees and it shows.",1,Former Employee,Deli Sales Associate ,"Billings Heights, MT",6/9/19,2019,6,9

Productive company to work at,I enjoyed working at The Wal-Mart Distribution Center in Ottawa I felt like I was making a difference.

Very poor Management & bad work culture.,I worked at a different Wal-Mart and it was very structured. This Wal-Mart Fulfilment Center is the worst place I have ever worked for.The plant Manager and his management team doesn't know how to manage their employees.There are also a lot of negative people that work there. The pay is low and the company doesn't follow the Wal-Mart culture or core values. It feels like you're working in a prision. Really think twice before you take this position.

Acceptable if you have no bills to pay,"Have worked there for years. Then they bumped new hire pay to what we were making, slashed raises, and told everybody who was already on payroll to deal with it.

Overall alright place,"Overall I believe Walmart is an alright company, but they do have a lot of downfalls and also turnovers because the way they decide to run things. Everyone is not always on the same page, and they also have favorites in the stores. They aren't always fair as far with their workers, they don't switch people around and allow them to learn other areas. Management aren't always on the same team, if you want to see your workers working together and getting alone, then they have to do the same thing and show us that and not just tell us. I've learned to not let people take advantage of you, know your worth and what you stand for, and don't go broadcasting your strengths because some people love to take advantage of it. You can be a good worker and work harder than others but somehow they will still find something to complain about and not appreciate you or your work. Management there don't know how to say thank you or even reward you.",3,Current Employee,Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Charlotte, NC",6/9/19,2019,6,9

Interesting Job,"A typical day at Walmart depending on the area I was assign; if I was in the office I was answering phone's greeting personal or Vendors, keying information, monitoring  CCTV, If their was an incident I would get a hold of the Rover to respond. Write a report of the incident log into Excel Spreed Sheet. I would have to send out Email to all  Higher Manager.  If I was assign to the gate I would be verifying all document that drivers would be bringing in verify trailer and seal and company that was bringing in the freight make and the count of freight.  The hardest part was couching associates for their unsafe  behavioral. Some of them didn't like to be told anything when they were doing something wrong.

Place is horrible,A few years ago it was a good place to work but within the last few years it’s gotten worse.   No holiday pay but they expect you to work on the holiday or else you get double points for calling in.   Management will hire people that know absolutely nothing about the job rather then experienced people for supervisors or lead roles.   And also expect you to stay longer then your shift to finish someone else’s department but won’t allow you to keep your overtime.   And now bonuses for hourly associates are getting smaller then what they previously were due to the new changes they made (probobly to save them money),1,Former Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,Sioux City Iowa 3590,6/8/19,2019,6,8

There is always someone around to ask a question of or for assistance. Checkouts are smooth and efficient. Prices are another subject. Walmart rarely has sales where there are sufficient cents or dollars off to warrant an extra purchase. Also, not having sales doesn't give the incentive to shop at Walmart for extra savings.

It was alright,I enjoyed it at first. Everyone is nice but after working there for awhile you end up doing a lot of the work. Kind of disappointing. I’m just an associate and get paid $11 but it’s not enough for how much work I have to do and how many nights I’m left all by myself at my station.

Management team needs adjustments.,It's just like being back in high school. The quibbling and talking behind your back. The yelling and temper tampers. That's the management team. Not all of them but way to many of them. They never get rid of the problem ones. Everyone walks on eggshells. You can't tell anyone that matters because they are the problem. Management backs up each other and really do not care. I believe that they are afraid of what will happen to them if they stand up to the rest of the management team.

Fast Paced. But expectations were high,I worked at the neighborhood market Walmart. I started as a cashier and I loved it and worked it for a few months but standing in 1 spot can do some damage on my feet. I decided to change positions to the MOD team. That was SOOO much better. I loved it so much because your working by yourself and you get very focused. The only downside to it is that the managers expectations were a little too high. I always met them but it wasn't without trouble.,4,Former Employee,Cashier/Stocking/Modifying Departments ,"West Palm Beach, FL",6/8/19,2019,6,8
Fun workplace,Not a bad job but they could pay better for us to be under staffed and have to put up all the freight on overnights.

Good in theory bad in practice,"The Higher up management care little for the actual workers, and only for their bottom line.  They make constant change when they don't see the results they want, however these changes often make life much harder for the employees, and the management. this causes unneeded stress for everyone everything rolls down hill. There is constant anger, and yelling in the back rooms from upset management because they just got yelled at by their management because the thing they didn't get told about wasn't done yet, and somehow that is the employee at the bottoms fault.  This happened so many times it was hard to keep track.  Most days all you had to do was keep your head down and just do your job while ignoring the constant anger floating around in the air.  it got more and more difficult to do though as time wore on.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker Cashier and Produce Associate ,"Searcy, AR",6/8/19,2019,6,8

Manager,"A typical day at walmart was always different for each position. Being a assistant manager overnights was always the same. I'd arrive @ 8pm and tour the store before relieving 2nd shift mgr. I'd print out my crew's schedule and assign their duties for the night. After our 10pm meeting, I'd go to the area with the most freight and help stock. After lunch I'd spend most of time cleaning up the backroom myself until 5am. Around that time I'd walk around the building to make sure the lot was clear of trash. At 5:30 is when my crew would clean up the areas they were assigned and starting zoning (cleaning and organizing the store) until it was time for them to clock out at 7am. Thats when day shift management would arrive and I would have to let them know what all has and hadn't been done as we toured the store to see what needed to be done that day in order to set 3rd shift up for a good night. Starting as a cashier 13 1/2 years ago to becoming a assistant manager has taught me alot. The hardest part of my job was always around inventory time. Working 60-70 hours a week to prepare the store for a good inventory was always the hardest. The best thing I loved about my job was my employees. Can't run a business without them and all their hard work.",3,Former Employee,Manager ,"Oxford, OH",6/8/19,2019,6,8
Not a good work enviorment,There is way too much favoritism. Management will not train you but will expect you to do a job you know nothing about. If your great at your job that just means you can do your job and somebody else's. I would not recommend working for this company. Every year it just gets worse. The bottom dollar is the only important thing to them not their employees. You are always replaceable. You can't ask questions it angers them.

Overall a good place to work at if you don't mind dealing with customers in a daily basis.,"Walmart is a fast pace environment with room to ascend. Management evaluate your work ethics the first couple of days and if they see potential in you they will approach you to learn a new area. They have an open door policy, in which if you don't feel right in the position that you are hired you can always change departments. Also, if you enjoy your position you can put your name in for a supervisor position and they will work with you to determine if you are fit for the position.  Walmart can be challenging at times specially the customer service area, but as long as you are knowledgeable about the policies and follow the rules and in most cases your gut, you will be just fine. The management team is willing to work with you as long as you are direct and confident with what you are asking of them.",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Englewood, CO",6/7/19,2019,6,7
Numbers Game,"Walmart is a nice place to work if you are young starting a career. I worked at the local D.C. and took the job in hopes of getting advancement. I hold two degrees and thought Walmart would be a great place for me to get into management. I actually made this known to my managers since the environment is suppose to support those who wish to move up. In turn I believe that making my intentions known was more detrimental than help. Walmart is a hughe corporation and everything is a numbers game....if you do not meet your numbers even when the situation is out of your control, you are responsible.

Pharmacy isn't bad.,"The pharmacy work isn't bad, it's fast-paced, when there's people to help, you get the excitement of dealing with drug addicts and people who're sick, but most of them aren't bad all told. The pharmacy manager seemed alright all told, he meant well and he worked hard, he also tried to keep us motivated, overall pretty good in my estimation. The only place he fell flat was when dealing with other managers. Other managers who were the bane of my existence. The store manager would seemingly-randomly change our schedules, despite the pharmacy manager trying to set a rational one. An unrelated pharmacy manager fired me because he was in the only functional bathroom, and didn't like that I knocked on the door._x000D__x000D_Cart pushing also isn't bad, a bit physically intensive and you'll want clothes for the weather, I stopped working that time because my car broke down._x000D__x000D_Hardest part is dealing with random management nonsense.",2,Former Employee,associate ,"Oklahoma City, OK",6/7/19,2019,6,7

Don't work there!!,Hours are currently being cut. They are no longer flexible on hours. No one except the managers are full time. I have been there for a year and just finally got a twenty-two cent raise. There is poor management there. There is only 4 managers in total that actually do what they are suppose to do. I am a cashier who use to love it but I have slowly grown to hate it. The rules that they are changing are ridiculous. The supervisor over the front end does not care at all.

Cashier at WalMart,"My time at Walmart was beneficial and enlightening in that the experience exposed me to work duties and customer interactions that I had never encountered before. I learned how to work independently to fulfill job expectations, as well as how to collaborate with my coworkers on tasks requiring the help of others. _x000D__x000D_However, I feel that the work experience, while helpful with a well-rounded understanding of today's work environments, was not necessarily furthering my desired set of skills. In addition, I began to a sense of miscommunication between the hierarchical levels of management, especially between the ""higher ups"" and the floor staff. On more than one occasion, a majority of the cashiers (including myself) would not learn of important trainings or policy changes until days after they were implemented. The pay increase was not as substantial as I would have liked, and the change in the attendance policy caused many to worry for their job standing. A large percentage of my coworkers were students, and not much care was given for excusing absences or tardiness based on school activities or exam schedules.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Clarksville, TN",6/7/19,2019,6,7

Evil managers expect you do the work of 2-3 8 hour job codes and get it done or else get in trouble and coached.,Don’t go to work at Walmart it’s job duties are timed in the fresh areas and expected to work two or more job codes and get it done on time.  Sure they gave us a raise to $11 but they cut hours so you don’t get a annual payout  based at $11 it’s the same as if they gave us NO raise.  Then the work load is impossible if you take your breaks you get even further behind.  Go home dripping in sweat from rushing all day and the stress is terrible it’s not worth working there.  The bosses are constantly coming to get on to you.

Walmart Distribution Center (Maintenance),"I've only worked for the company at a distribution center and never was a production worker, always support. Unless something broke down or there was an unscheduled outage, I left at my scheduled time. Yes, the warehouse life is fast paced. Production workers have it different than support, as they usually are uncertain of how long they'll be there on a given day. That's dependant on volume. The company is working to even out the production associates work week, but with the way customers need to be serviced, 24x7x364, it's tough. I'm well compensated for my job and living area, my pay is over $25/hr. They keep changing their vacation system ""for the better"". Don't expect to be able to negotiate 3 weeks vacation. Their system is built off of length of service. You accumulate an X amount of time per week (bi weekly pay). You also have to compete for time off against associates whom been there for many years. We use to accrue personal and sick time. Sick was capped at 192 hours and personal wasn't capped at all. These are now considered legacy time and you're no longer able to accrue either.

Being afraid of getting attacked because of the brawls that they would sometimes get into, talking to the cops every couple of weeks if we were lucky, nor a lot of the management.

I worked in the fridge.,"Before I begin this review, I should mention that I was a college student with strong time demands for homework that were never met by Walmart. I originally signed up to only work 25 hours a week, which worked for about a week, and then I was given more hours each next week until I talked to my manager and he lowered the number of hours for me. My day would usually be, go to class, finish school for the day, have a small snack and then go to work, get back at night, sleep. On the job I worked in the fridge, my coworkers told me that sometimes we're able to go outside the fridge and stock yogurt from the front of the shelves. I'd look forward to that since I was always cold. I asked if I could switch sections but I was denied.

It depends on whos in charge and where you are.,I was in the money center. It wasn't always busy so they would have me help in customer service or out on a cash register. Overall it's not the worst place to work. I had a minor issue with a CSM (customer service manager). She just didnt have such a positive vibe. she seemed very rude and inconsiderate of anyone that she didnt play favorites with. My job was simple and a higher pay rate but had a lot of responsibility. Also one week was only 32 hours where the next would be 38 to 40 hours. Made it difficult to keep up with bills. I would work 2 morning shifts and 3 evening shifts. not very good for my son.,4,Former Employee,MONEY CENTER ASSOCIATE ,"Fairfield, OH",6/6/19,2019,6,6

Ever Evolving Place to Work,"It's an okay place to work. There's no guarantee of job security, due to all the rapid changes. It depends on the store what kind of work environment it is.

My over-all Walmart Summary,"My typical workday consists of; counting down remaining tills, and assigning my cashiers breaks and workstations. As well as, issuing out breaks and doing product returns. I learned a lot at Walmart, like; how to operate a tow motor, how to drive a Zamboni, how to fix equipment, how to be more personable with my fellow associates, know what not to say and what to say, how to train on the fly, and how to fix small problems my cashiers may have. My management team has had their up’s and downs, meaning, we have changed management quite a bit. The only problem I’ve had with management was, the frequent changing of the guard. When there was a new management change, our culture changed somewhat. But they were right there in the thick of it with us, and work just as hard as we did. Our workplace culture was laxed, because we are over-night. The customer volume was not as much as it is during the day. Over-nights are pretty much the clean-up crew; we put out the stock, cleaned the floors, and attend to the customers needs. Although, not all our departments are open over-night, and that makes the job a little difficult. Customers want a certain thing, or need a certain procedure done that is not provided over-night, such as; check-cashing, online pick-up or customer service issues. We could handle returns, but each customer had to have a receipt, or we could not complete the return, via Management. What I enjoyed the most was the people I work with, they are a class-act, and a few of the former employees and I are still friends. I’ve built a good repour with some of my associates outside - more...",5,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Stow, OH",6/6/19,2019,6,6

Walmart,Wal-Mart is a good first time job but the location I was at was very rude and messy.

Micromanagement,"Lately, management has been more prone to micro-manage it's employees and attempt to get more work out of them than is possible. When Marketing estimates a task should take 3 hours, you get it done in 2 hours, and they want you to work harder to get the task done in 1 hour, it creates a stressful environment.",2,Former Employee,Modular Reset Associate ,"Vienna, WV",6/6/19,2019,6,6

Fairly Relaxing place to work and competitive.,Typically once i arrive at work we immediately start the meeting in the break room where the Assistant manager will tell us where everyone will be working. Depending on the amount of trucks we receive us on the mod team will either do mods or get put to stock various departments. The management really depends on the type of person they are most times they will be understanding about certain situations while other like things done their way and under a strict time limit.

Stressful workplace with little regard for csm,I started as a cashier and worked my way up to customer service manager. I even helped open my stores own stand alone liquor store. Funny thing that I was promoted to customer service manager in june of 2018 and never given the training for how to be a customer service manager or csm. Holidays were very crazy. Upper management keep rotating front end managera every 3-5 months so the rules always changed. By the end of the holiday season upper management basically told me that they believed I was not a good fit for the position. I was told to either drop back down to a regular cashier or be fired. I decided to quit because I felt dropping down was a slap in the face. The other thing I did not lile was that management was always putting blame on me for things that were out of my control.

A job but not a career.,"I have worked for several Walmart’s in 2 different states. All have high employee expectations with inferior management. The training is a joke. Understaffing is routine while the bar is set high. It’s normal to be yelled at by a supervisor for being unable to complete tasks even when they acknowledge the staffing issue. Management serves only that purpose. They will not offer assistance or guidance, just personal conversations about your performance. Even when it’s not your fault it still somehow manages to be your fault. Want lousy hours, high stress, and mediocre pay?

Inconsistant,"At my Wal-Mart location management staff was VERY inconsistant. It was a case of ""too many chiefs and not enough indians"".

The hours was something I was very aware of going in, but I did not fully realize the effect it would have on my social life. Taught me a valuable lesson.

Great place to work unless you keep to yourself.,"They are unorganized and fill with uneducated managers, literally, which by it being me cause a lot of problems for me. _x000D_1. Nobody never knows where a manager at when you need support. _x000D_2. Somebody always need help but they not putting in any effort. _x000D_3. They love giving uneducated people mangers positions and wonder why the store still looking a mess, why the trucks not unloaded, or why does it takes these many of people to get a one man job done. 🤷🏾‍♀️",2,Former Employee,Cap 2 Team Member ,"McComb, MS",6/5/19,2019,6,5

"Allright environment, poor management","I really enjoyed my job while i worked there. Only problem i had was some management issues. I was fired over the phone while be rushed to the emergency room. I was given 3 points for snow days that were supposed to be covered, that management told me was covered. I was verbally abused at work, while my personal information was being spread to other workers in the back room without my permission on days i was not even working. Any of the good managers we had, even quit. We only had two managers left when i got fired wrongfully. The district manager refused to help anybody with anything. Management would make employees cry and force them to do things not under their job description. There was a cockroach infestation where I worked and they refused to fix the problem. Expired food was always being sold and the supervisor for the food department refused to remove the expired food. We received many customer complaints almost daily. A co-worker of mine received an injury on the job and they refused to let her write an incident report. Then proceeded to force her to work with stocking carts that weight more than twice her own weight, while on crutches from the work related injury. When i was fired, i filed a report for everything that happened, and corporate treated me just as badly. I hope one day all these problems are fixed and people get the justice they deserve.",3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Grandville, MI",6/5/19,2019,6,5
Great benefits and not really great anything else.,"Walmart management was not good to me. I put in for a promotion two different times in the department I had worked in for 2 years. I knew this department like the back of my hand and could run it with my eyes closed. I also loved it. I helped this department go from the messy, bare shelved department it was into a thriving part of that Walmart. I truly feel as if that fabric department would not have been in as good of a state had I not stepped in and helped it. I got ignored, stepped on, treated poorly by my management team (due to a disability({my shoulder was injured})) and pushed out the door. I would never work here again.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Johnson City, TN",6/5/19,2019,6,5

A good place to be if you have a lot of patience and good work ethic,Walmart itself is not a bad company. But the compensation doesn't cover the amount of verbal abuse that you receive from customers and management. Some managers know how to speak to people and some don't.,4,Current Employee,AP Customer Host ,"Mooresville, NC",6/5/19,2019,6,5

TOO much work for so little pay,"Walmart wants you to give them the moon and the stars but don't want to pay you what you are really worth.

Management...whats that?,Walmart needs to let there managers do there job and stay out of the way.

Walmart does not care about their employees!,"They literally tell you that they expect you to work like three people in orientation. Which I am used to. I have been in management for 18 years. I started out in produce, moved to cake decorator then was offered management within 6 months. You are expected to run two sometimes more departments with very little to no help. The pay is a joke for what they expect from you. Then if you decide it isn’t for you and you want to step down they cut your pay more than the raise they gave you for the position in the first place! I’m no stranger to hard work! I love it! But what Walmart expect is asinine!",1,Current Employee,Housewares Department Manager ,"Mesa, AZ",6/5/19,2019,6,5

No Promise of Career Advancements,I was basically used by management because of my attention to detail and was even told by management on another shift about it. I trained 6 people and was promised management opportunities but was never even certified to ever even be a trainer.

Not even worth looking at applying,"I was on 2nd shift stocking and the amount of work we have to do is ridiculous. For example: Unload truck, stock everything from the truck, pick up the slack from other positions, clean-up. If you apply for stocking, they will make you do cashiering sometimes. There is no advancement in the company and management has the most illogical thinking. Bad benefits since they keep taking more away from you the more you work there. Can't use paid time off since they reject every request. Full-time employees don't get full-time employment benefits._x000D_If a different position then stocking had done very little, then we have to do their work and they get no consequences. The management and the company are the biggest downsides of the job.",2,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"South Milwaukee, WI",6/4/19,2019,6,4
Worse management you’ll ever have,"Been working for Walmart for 6 years and have been promoted twice with raises on all six years and only make 15 an hour. That amount of work you do as a supervisor and the amount your paid is not worth it. Management has a “Just get it done” attitude. Even when you have no people to do the work, making for very overworked and poorly paid people. Hard workers get worked to the ground while poor workers stick around and do nothing. You’ll get sick and tired of putting 120% and getting no where while people putting 30% get to to stay that way and barely ever get held accountable. You’ll always be stuck with bad workers when your a supervisor and whenever you do get a good one they end up quitting or become influenced by the poor workers. Management will promise you the world if you keep doing things for them and never deliver.

Will not let you go anywhere,I tried to go to cap two. Tried to relocate. I was told no. Over and over. Can't move up. They just run you ragged. Bad place to work.

My phone was stolen because of that fact and I couldn't keep my personal belongings close to me",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Dania Beach, FL",6/4/19,2019,6,4
Fine for student job,"Walmart is a retail job, and it shows. The schedule is likely to change at the drop of a hat, coustomers are likely to confront you for little reason, it's quite slow paced with bursts of work, over all it's an okay place to work but not something worth a career.",3,Current Employee,Cart associate ,"Perry, GA",6/4/19,2019,6,4

Not the best place to work.,"Trash. Managers with no experience in retail get hired and don't know what they are doing. They do not know how to schedual anybody. You get introuble if you get even 10 minutes of over time by accident. They expect you to show up every day, even when you are sick as a dog. They say they are a family friendly employer, but its not true.",1,Current Employee,Hourly Associate ,"Monroe, WA",6/4/19,2019,6,4
not very good,The management would be extremely rude if you had any questions regarding a product or money order. The main manager would call you out in front of customers when you failed to meet their credit card requirements. Would not work with you on schooling or house hold problems. When you switched registers after the end of your break and the person who ran the register before hand messed up with any of the money you were blamed for their mistake at the end of you shift.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Jacksboro, TN",6/4/19,2019,6,4

Its a fun place to work at the first couple months then things change,"They treat you well the first couple months then they start to change.

Boring job with okay upper level management.,"A typical day would include cleaning bathrooms, taking out the trash, sweeping the floor, etc. During the day there is at least 6 assistant managers and the two head managers roaming around the store, conducting their business, after 8 PM there is usually about 3-4 managers if that. The head managers at my store were constantly nagging about something small, but other than that they were fair. Walmart requires you to call into the store, and into the associate hotline to call off, which I personally believe is dumb. They schedule you on the hours you are available. You will work any day during the week, and on holidays. It is an okay place to start but I would not recommend it for a long term placement unless you desire to work in retail.",3,Current Employee,Janitor ,"Erie, PA",6/4/19,2019,6,4
Somewhat Decent Place to Work,"It's an OK place to work. However, it's not something I want to do for more than a few years. Management can be hit or miss depending on who is on duty.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Tampa, FL",6/4/19,2019,6,4
Fun place to work,Spent days on register checking out customers. Learned enough on the register to be transferred to customer service doing refunds.

The best part was meeting new people all the time and making new friends.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Garland, TX",6/4/19,2019,6,4
I dont recommend this as a long term job,While working at walmart i will say management was hit or miss. typical day was either relaxed and get the job done or stressful. it wasnt consistent. i do not have plans to return to this position because of harassment that took place when addressed was overlooked and pardoned. but when i was apart of a different altercation i was let go. i did not leave on good terms but can return at this time. i have no plans to return unless a higher position or part time cashier,3,Former Employee,IMS/Cap Team 2/Cashier/Garden Sales Associate ,"Dallas, TX",6/4/19,2019,6,4

Meeting new people and developing friendships.,I come to work happy and leave work happy. Their might be stress but I learned to keep it at the door of my job and don't bring it out on the customers or have attitudes while i'm working. The employees are very friendly and we have had things in common. We developed friendships as well.

Company is not what it used to be,"Working at the Home office I absolutely adored this company, LOVED going to work every day, and felt I was important to my position.  I am now working in the field, and the management at my club has zero respect for the individual, club manager cusses and degrades other associates over the walkie talkies, throws things when he gets mad and overall he cannot be trusted by other associates. This is not the culture I have witness in the past and surely not the culture that you are held to at home office.  The new attendance policy in the field is a joke with no regard to family emergencies or taking the time needed if you are sick and need some time to recover.  I am so disappointed in ""my company""",1,Current Employee,Membership Coordinator ,"Conway, AR",6/4/19,2019,6,4

It’s Walmart,I’m an hourly mgt what can I say Walmart pays wells but the need changes they have role out pretty much cancels the higher pay now. They are using a schedule right program in which a computer generates associates schedules for the next 2 weeks or so in other words if  the system says you are need only 16 hours that week that’s what you get for that week . You can pick up other shifts in other hours of the store but you have to already been trained for those areas and they have to be approved by management. Your really only guaranteed hours if your and hourly supervisor to be honest. This system short hands the entire store in order to count payroll cost one of the meetings I went to stated that Walmart wastes nearly a million or 2 per store on payroll. Mgt is awful at least in my market they all have their own agenda and the do not communicate with each other at all the fresh operations manager will come in my store to walk it and say one thing than the market manager will come in weeks later and say something completely different. They also do not follow one best way which is Walmart’s bible like I said that all come in with their on agenda. Store salaried management only care when company big wigs come in town. There is never enough equipment or people but the expect for you to have things done by a certain time and there isn’t any consistency as far as quality of work in the fresh department second shift is horrible and my store has be ready a month or 2 without a fresh cap supervisor also Walmart has and is cutting a lot of jobs out we went from 4 department manager to 3 - more...,3,Current Employee,Fresh Food Manager ,"Huntsville, AL",6/4/19,2019,6,4

Great place to work,Ive worked for walmart on multiple occasions. Everyone bad mouths walmart because they dont have a good enough work ethic to be apart of a team. Its not bad if you go in and do what you're told. Yes they can put a large load of work on you but mainly because they need to. Now a days no one seems to want to focus and spend most of the time socializing instead of working and end up being in trouble and act as though its unfair. Walmart has many benefits and options for careers if you actually put in the effort. You can make alot of friends and professional connections in walmart with the right attitude. Anyone who wants a decent paying solid job in retail should definitely apply to a walmart near them.,5,Current Employee,Shift Supervisor ,"Teaticket, MA",6/4/19,2019,6,4

Don't Care for Walmart,"I did not have a good experience with Walmart, though to be fair people weren't as aware of Autism as they are now. It was simply too big a store for me to work at as I would frequently be asked about the location of items outside of my department. I would need to turn to fellow coworkers (had no radios at the time) for help with this which resulted in unhappy customers. I do not recommend working at Walmart if you can't take disrespect as well as you give it. Not everyone, ESPECIALLY at Walmart, will reciprocate it, though I think that's common knowledge at this point.",3,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Syracuse, UT",6/3/19,2019,6,3
easy going work environment,"working  as a cashier was easy, managers are pretty laid back but also enforces rules and ethics. working as a overnight stocker was a bit stressful as sometimes the work load that is assigned would be far too much for one person in that department to complete. but it didnt always happen every night. management was very fun and laid back for both jobs, however some assistant managers were too rude and had a slight abuse of power. the hardest part of the job working as a cashier was dealing with rude customers and the hardest part of  being an overnight stocker was the work load that was expected to be completed every night. the most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck, lets be real, not going to lie some coworkers made the work place a little less boring.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Flagstaff, AZ 86001",6/3/19,2019,6,3

Management does not care,i come in and begin to unload the truck.  Managers being to talk down to me telling me i need to get a specific job done at a specific time.  They give a unreasonable time to get things done.  Workplace is stressful.  Managers decide to change associates schedules as they please without notice.  Managers take vacations every other week.

Good place to gain experience but not good for permanent work,Most co workers are friendly and the hours are pretty flexible as long as you have open availability. I wanted to move up and was told there was no openings for management when they're were two open management positions. I suspect they didn't want me to move up because they want me to stay as a Tire Technician. Management can be pretty bad as in they are bad with communication and are hard to find.

A cashier's perspective working for one of the largest companies in the world,"I can't speak for every employee at Walmart, especially those at different stores, but I would in depth mingle and ask every employee I met how they felt about their job and if they were compensated fairly. And their answers for the most part were pretty consistent, there were a few stray opinions but most people I talked to pretty much agreed. However I do not have the perspectives of any managers above department and Customer service managers. So this would be a view of  Walmart from the cashier at one of the super stores, a guy bottom of the barrel if you will. Walmart is all about cutting costs in every way possible. Whether it be using less paper towels to clean up a mess, cutting hours a bit for not meeting minimum profit expectancy, but a certain level of quality is also cut. Don't get me wrong most employees are not willing to cut corners but when you try to cut costs a certain quality becomes obviously missing. Though nothing that would impact that Walmart customers. Most customers don't even notice it. I didn't even notice it until I was an employee. I'm not saying this is bad. Obviously this system has worked, Walmart is one of the biggest companies in the entire world. And of course every big company has i ts dark secrets and will do something dodgy every now and again. Not any one method Walmart does is bad. Looking at them by themselves in a vacuum makes it hard to even complain really. But everything building on top of each other as far as I can tell, most employees feel unsatisfied. It can be difficult to say we are under compensated especially being well above - more...",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Jacksonville, FL",6/3/19,2019,6,3

walmart is a good place to work at overall.,"A typical work day is you go in you wash your hands, put on a apron, then you look on the schedule to see what is your task, it can be cooking, putting in chickens, prepping for the day, etc. I've learned that working with a team makes you feel better and it makes it way more fun. Also, learned how to cook new things and clean new objects. Management helps you out a lot especially when their is a wave of people and if you need to switch your hours there very flexible. The hardest part is when your trying to do your job and then you get a crowd of customers and you got to leave the thing you were working on to go help the customers. The best thing working there is that I made a lot of friends, also the best thing is when we close up for the day and do it all again the next day.

Not a long term job for a people person,"I’ve worked at 2 Walmart’s & 3 different positions throughout the entire 3 years i’ve been there. The first one in Neenah, WI was a better experience than the one on South 27th in Milwaukee, WI. I worked as a cashier at the Walmart in Neenah which was a good experience. Some customers were rude but it was manageable. The managers were responsive & attentive. They had good manners & a few were easy to go to about problems. I was sure that if something was bothering me it would be dealt with. As far as the Walmart in Milwaukee.. the total opposite. I worked as a cap 1 & overnight associate at that Walmart. Terrible management, poor language use, not one inch of professionalism even with the management. Shift duties were inconsistent & always a complaint about something. Nothing was ever good enough even if it was my best & I’m not a lazy worker. No appreciation whatsoever. Favoritism up & down in the store. Rules applied to certain people which were mainly the ones that the managers weren’t “cool” with. Just overall awful when it came to the associates.

walmart review,"Atypical day at my job starts at 4:00am and ends at 1:00pm.We come in and wait for the truck to come once it does we unpack the truck, down stack the pallets and move the live freight onto our carts. We run the live freight til it is gone then we break off into different departments to run the picks/ over stock. In this short time period at Walmart I've learned how to cap bins and make picks, I have learned how to mark overstock and depose of unfresh produce so that it doesn't cause shrink in our store. The management at Walmart is very poor, they are very un-motivated and over all not concerned about their employees. The hardest part of my job is having to get up so early to go into work, and getting hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is that for the most part I can move at my own pace.",4,Current Employee,Fresh Produce Associate ,"Smithfield, NC",6/2/19,2019,6,2

Very depressing atmosphere and poor management,"I worked at Walmart as an overnight stocker during the summer 7 years ago  and am hoping for the current employees’/prospective applicants’ sake that things have changed in the years since. Management was horrible and unprofessional and had no problem openly berating employees. One of our managers—the nicer of the two, if I’m being honest—abandoned his job in the middle of his shift without any warning. Most of the people I worked with were 40+ but they were very petty and immature and liked to gossip and backstab others. We all took breaks and lunches together and it was very depressing, as some employees couldn’t even afford to eat lunch. We were being paid $2.50 an hour less than the stock team at the competitor right down the street. The work itself wasn’t too hard. I worked mostly in the automotive department, which was incredibly quiet overnight, and I didn’t have to socialize much with anyone else because the department had its own ware room.  In fact, solitary work might have been the only upside to this job. Hopefully things are different now but from what I experienced, I don’t recommend it to anyone.",2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Waxahachie, TX",6/2/19,2019,6,2

Free Donut Fridays,"When interviewed at Wal-Mart it is quick. If you are called back it will be for a different position with that manager. If you are accepted you wont find out immediately because the manager is evasive. You will stand around waiting until someone aknowleges you. Typical day at Wal-mart is extremely stressful. You are yelled at. You are treated as a child unless you stand up to them. Management. Anyone can take the management assessment test. 70 questions takes an hour. You don't have to have skills or a personality. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet to long periods of time. Hard if you are not use to it. Lots of heavy lifting. Depending on the department you are in will depend on the weight. Expect over 55lbs. Enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people. Working for the actual company sucks. Wal-Mart is not for the faint of heart. You need to be of thick skin for the indurance of it. All benefits have been taken away except for 5 days of PTO that you have to icure over time. If you have 5 call in days expect to be fired on the 5th day. There is no credit for your work particularly if you work hard and have a work ethic. Wal-Mart wants you to work over but they will take it away on another day within the pay period so you are not in overtime. Like I said Wal-Mart is for Wa-Mart, not for it's people. They are only interested in making the money. This is why there are so many employees looking for another job that are so discouraged. In the breakroom or out of it, you don't hear anything positive.",1,Current Employee,Personal Shopper/Cashier ,"Panama City, FL",6/1/19,2019,6,1

Poor management and no 40 hours even if full time.,Management doesn’t communicate at all. So no one knows what’s going on have the time.

It's like management has a vendetta against it's employees.,"A typical day at Walmart is monotonous and exhausting. In my position, I would unload 1 or 2 trucks (no matter how much was delivered in one day, we wouldn't be permitted breaks or even our legally required lunch until everything was unloaded), then we would stock shelves until the end of the night. Management was harsh and unforgiving, and treated us with blatant disrespect. One in particular would talk at us and when she was done, she would say ""Bye. BYE,"" until we walked away, rather than speaking to us like normal people. The only pleasant part of the job was my coworkers who were on the same level as me. all low level employees understood what it was like to be treated poorly by management so they were all kind and helpful.

You have to stay until everything's finished and if you don't you have to take a long lunch the next day to compensate, and then the next day, and the next, since you'll just end up staying later and later because of the long lunches.

I got through the day and I thought maybe the next one would be better. I was wrong. Next day I come in I was assigned to put freight out on the sales floor. Again, I was never shown how to stock, I was just told ""do this"" and that's it. No one cared about anything. I went to a manager and they could not care less.

Walmart is a great company to work for.,"I love the values of Walmart, not always are the values applied by management.  There is much stress upon the managers, they in turn pass their stress and frustrations upon the associates .  I have really enjoyed learning tolerance of differences with my fellow associates.  The income is ridiculously low, and the benefits are of great value, which makes the shortage of income tolerable.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is never a dull moment.  Always something to do with plenty of movement.  I appreciate be self directed and meeting my goals or goals set for me to meet.

"Good experience for me, but not something I can recommend","First of all, I can say that the experience of being part of the Walmart team made me a better person in the long run, but it is something I wish I had gone through in high school or college and not after graduating college. But I graduated into the Bush/Obama recession and jobs were scarce, so I couldn't afford to be picky. The starting pay wasn't bad, but the raises were pitiful (10 cents at every evaluation, really?) At first glance, a company the size of Walmart should have plenty of upward mobility, but the reality is that promotions were related to politics and being part of the right social network than they were related to work ethic. I worked myself to the point of physical exhaustion, and when my supervisors encouraged me to go for promotions, I was always overlooked by the management. I basically had zero personal life for six years. After I begged the right people, they finally started giving me Sundays off so I could start attending church again and at least pretend I had friends one day a week. But this company truly expects 24/7 availability out of its associates, so be willing to sign your entire life over to Walmart. After working for 6 years, I still had not accrued an entire weeks worth of vacation._x000D__x000D_The silver lining to this cloud was my peers and co-workers, and I may have gotten very lucky.

Relatively fun place to work,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. The customers were unbelievably friendly, and most of the staff were amazing. I was a pretty socially anxious person, but being at Walmart for so long really helped my people skills. My favorite parts were when I was on a register and it was steady busy. And when I was picking the groceries as a personal shopper, I personally found it fun, going down the aisles and scanning the groceries. The hardest part of the job for me was the micro managing, and the favoritism. I understand that a manager will have favorites, but it shouldn't interfere with another person's schedule, or work day. And micro managing is a bit of a pet peeve for me, because once I catch on, I know what I'm doing, and I don't particularly enjoy being watched like a hawk. Multitasking got easier, because I had to juggle answering a phone and giving a person their groceries, or answer a phone and ring a person up.

Fast-paced workplace with few hardworkers,"Typically, a day at work consists of unloading a general merchandise truck by hand with between six and eight people. Then, we go to stock the merchandise on the sales floor. That really is the whole job. Sometimes everything gets finished, and sometimes we just don't have enough people to get the job done. The only things that I have learned are about stocking and using the equipment inside the store like the baler and the pallet jack. The management there can be nice, and they can be mean, but most of them are just there to get their job done and go home. The culture of the workplace is friendly and enjoyable most days. The hardest part of the job is the amount of physical activity that is endured on a daily basis.

No support,Walmart is not the place to work I worked there 16 years only to be terminated due to something they could of prevented by getting me off my register when I called them to not go over my five hours but they sent no one which caused me to hit my 5 hrs there for making me violate the policy not once but twice causing my termination.  I had a line of customers and was only cshier in garden center and also could not leave garden door unattended as its a high theft store. No door attendant ment I had to cashier and watch the door. They had adequate notice to get me a replacement but ignored my request and would not fix my violation. I was a honest dedicated associate who put 16 years in with many extra hours and never appreciated sometimes staying till 3 am in morning cause there cash recycler broke and i had to close store by myself dumping 24 registers and resetting the self check. as well as manage my cashiers as a Customer Service Manager.,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Manager ,"Sunnyside, WA",5/29/19,2019,5,29

A Productive Workplace,"When working at Walmart you have two decisions. You can either stand your ground with your job position or be open to work wherever they ask you to. When I worked at Walmart, I was hired as a cashier but from time to time I was asked to do a job I didn't know how to do. The managers at Walmart were very supportive and were willing to help you if you were willing to help them in return.",4,Former Employee,Cashier & Customer Service Manager's Support ,"Parker, CO",5/29/19,2019,5,29
"Pretty well paying place of employment with pretty cool coworkers, however the management was very unrealistic and very fast paced work environment","Walmart is a pretty well paying place of employment, and a typical day at work is exactly what you’d expect one to be, what I learned (with Walmart being my first job) was that I it and most likely many other places of employment are very fast paced and I cannot go at my own pace and will have to try and pick up the pace. However when it comes to the management, they were most of the time very unrealistic and expected me (someone who was relatively new) to be able to do what someone who had been there for 5-10 years was able to do and that hardly seemed fair to me therefore leading to conflicts between me and the management. The workplace culture is a very fast paced and stressful one and can at times be overwhelming. The worst part of this job in my opinion was probably the management being down my throat at all times however it was tolerable in most cases. On the flip side though the best part of this job was the opportunity I had to make new friends with the coworkers I had the chance to meet and the life lessons I go to learn from working there, all in all it was a good experience and I would recommend working there if you have the patience to deal with the management.",4,Former Employee,Walmart cart pusher ,"Chesapeake, VA",5/29/19,2019,5,29
Not a bad place to work especially for a student,The job is not demanding it just includes many tasks that can be redundant yet they are simple to do.  Some of the employees do not act professionally or take initiative for simple things like taking out trash or being considerate of others.  The leadership has a few good co managers with potential for improvement however after many surveys and discussions I don not see any improvements being made.  If that was done they probably could hire more people as we are understaffed instead of continuously losing people.,3,Current Employee,Frozen/Dairy Associate ,"Eau Claire, WI",5/29/19,2019,5,29
Its a job,Honestly it’s a job they say they’re flexible but if you don’t have unlimited availability you won’t get hours. Even if you do have unlimited availability you aren’t guaranteed more than 30 hours with the new schedule system. They pay $11/hr but you are given more assignments than you are able to accomplish properly. Breaks are few and hard to come by. You are cross trained for half of the store and then left to rot. If you don’t finish your massive pile of assignments you are coached whether it was a possible challenge or not. If I could give it less than one star I would.,1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Nacogdoches, TX",5/29/19,2019,5,29

"Poor Management, Awful Customers",Management is poor and sits in the office playing on their phones. They won't help you with anything you need but bark orders when they need you. Customers scream at you for things that are your fault and not even related to your position. Once I had a lady scream at me because we didnt have vacuum cleaner bags in Electronics because a vacuum cleaner is an electronic. Overall bad place to work. Inconsistent hours. Different shift every day. Random days off. Sometimes work 6 to 7 days in a row because of how they split the work week on Saturday. Poor management. Lazy coworkers. Avoid this place. Pay is awful considering you do 3 managers jobs a day while they play on their phone.,2,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Customer Service ,"Hendersonville, TN",5/29/19,2019,5,29

Competitive and Challenging providing excellent working experience,In my honest opinion working for Walmart in the management level provided a significant challenge with obtaining a good work/home balance.

They terminated me the week of my paid time off vacation that they gave me and said I pointed out which was a lie. I was spending as much time left with family and my father as I could without trying to ruin my rep at work.

Company expectations don't match reality.,"Management is constantly pushing high expectations on their workers, but there is almost never any consideration to whether or not those expectations are reasonable or even physically possible. They're constantly understaffed, yet expect performance to be consistant as if every position is being worked.

Great oppurtunity to work with people but horrible managmment,Everyone starts a typical work day by clocking in and reporting to your departments supervisor and that is the best thing to happen all day. Supervisors are the management basic employees see and upper management only ever talks to you through them or if something bad happens to you personally.

Walmart can be a tricky place to work...,"I have been working at Walmart for almost two years now, and with all the experience I have had there, I would say your time there is ultimately affected by the managers you have. Walmart managers are changing a lot, always at least once a year, and definitely at least a few times a year as well. They really determine the atmosphere at the store. I would say ours was extremely strict with no room for creativity or individualism. I work in Online Grocery Pickup, and I started about a month after its opening in our store. It was very new at the time, and is still fairly new in general. Over the course of my working in OGP I have seen many changes, whether it be management, the number of orders and customers we handle a day, the staff in my department, and policies around the store. The hardest part is definitely working your way around favoritism by managers, and just feeling unappreciated. It may just be something that is natural, but I feel it really can bring someone's hopes down, and passion for the job entirely. It makes someone feel like they are working for nothing. The most enjoyable part is feeling fulfilled after a hard day, knowing that you completed it and that you can take on anything. My job is very day to day, and what you complete in that day is important, and I enjoy knowing that I did a good day of work. I also love the feeling I get when I can help a customer by giving some of my personal experiences and recommendations, and them liking my answers. It's a nice feeling when you can actually help a customer, and not just give a generic answer.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service ,"Valparaiso, IN 46385",5/28/19,2019,5,28

The worst place I have ever worked.,"Walmart Super Center in New Albany, MS is the worst place I have worked in my entire life.  I have held many jobs, including part-time, full-time, manual labor, professional work, etc.  Walmart in New Albany is a very negative environment, with immature and incompetent management which engager in frequent power struggles with staff.  The attendance policy is a joke, which is not executed equally among employees.  Also, this company discriminated extremely against disabled employees.  If you are looking for work in retail, there are other retail places to try, and I would strongly suggest trying the others.

"Lazy management, okay benifits, fair pay.","Management can be lazy and not listen to problems that you tell them of. Some seem to be incompetent in their managing. Some managers do know how to organize and plan for what needs to be done.     You get paid time off based off of your time worked. You get protected paid time off for sudden reasons to leave. Also gained through hours worked. You get 5 points of freedom. It is alright in that it is hard to get all five points.

Customer service managers are better than the actual managers.,"The customer service managers (CSM) are the best part of the store. The actual managers have no clue what any of the cashiers or CSM’s do. They don’t want to ever give you requested time off, they will fire you without telling you that you’re fired. (Happened to me and a couple other workers)  The management doesn’t help you while you’re working, or they take their sweet sweet time getting to you, or they forget about you completely. And you have to annoy them to help you. But the majority of customers and cashiers and CSM’s are the best part of the job. You don’t necessarily need the management to aid you in this job anyways. It’s fairly self explanatory once you figure out all the buttons on register.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Amelia, OH",5/27/19,2019,5,27

Ignores Non-work Life Needs with Strict New Hire Restrictions,"A typical day being a cashier at Wal-Mart is pretty mundane. Clocking in, going to your supervisor to find which cashier you will be at, checking out customers, and keeping the candies and other miscellaneous products neat in the check out aisle. Two mandatory breaks if you are working more than 8 hours I think, which is nice._x000D_There is a 6 month new hire period where new employees will not get discounts, paid time off, or any other benefits until after 6 months. New employees were also only given, I think, 4 times a month they could call off 24 hours or more before their shift, but any more and they would be fired. Although as long as you keep ahead and let them know when you plan on being off about 2 weeks before, you might be fine._x000D_I was a college student when working at this Wal-Mart and told them that I would like to work 20 hours due to high-level classes I was taking at the time. The supervisors completely ignored my preferences, making me work 32 hours a week. I also did not have a car to go to work, so I took the bus, but the bus stops at 9:40 p.m. and I was housed a mile away. When I asked to stop working until 11:00 p.m. so I did not have to walk home in the dark after work, they refused. I also asked to lower my hours because my grades were dropping rapidly due to my long work hours and little time in between classes and work. They complied but only lowered my hours to 30. Eventually due to their lack of concern about my personal life issues caused by my hours I gave my two-week notice and quit.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Athens, OH",5/27/19,2019,5,27

Without the hot bar, all we could do is clean, and once we finished the deep cleaning, we had nothing to do. And it was like this for over a month. I would close almost every night and the amount of stuff needed to be done couldn't be stretched long enough. So for a large part of the day, we would pretty much just be standing around waiting for a customer.

Good work environment at first......,I liked the job when i first got it but they were changing to the brand new system of how to do things and honestly no one knows what they’re doing anymore. The managers try to do what they think is best but there’s so many different managers they all think something different is better so when getting trained it was so confusing and then you would get in trouble for doing stuff wrong but you got trained to do it that way! it’s stressful and they need to get on the same page in upper management so it doesn’t trickle down on the employees.,3,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 2 Associate ,"Hutchinson, KS",5/26/19,2019,5,26
Stressful understaffed job,Very greedy with hours the pick there favorites in the store if your not a favorite you won't get to keep the job as long as you want. It will be till they want u gone then they will make up and do anything to get rid of you. They expect 1 person to do the job of 2 or more could do. If you get FMLA like I did for my sick dad. They will find a way to let u go even when I have never been in trouble. The pay was not bad but you don't get enough hours for the pay to make a difference. And any time they decided to change days you can miss or PTO and other things that goes on how long you have worked there and all the hours you have put in. They change it with no care that it makes people start all over after all the time there it's like your new again. They just don't care about employees like they say they do.

One week you could get 30 hours, the next... you have to do mandatory ""overtime"" (you just make up hours they sent you home for).

Lack Of Accountability,Not everyone is treated fairly. Lack of accountability of associates. Lack of communication and structure. Wal-Mart has great tools for helping the store but the tools are not utilized.,3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Supervisor ,"Lowville, NY",5/26/19,2019,5,26
Stressful and lack of management skills,There is a lack of management skills at Walmart. Management treats you like you are less then them and they are VERY unprofessional. If you are not “friends” with a manager you will get no where.,2,Current Employee,Fresh Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",5/26/19,2019,5,26
Hard period.,It’s hard being at a place where people don’t pull their own weight. You constantly have to walk into a mess and pray you don’t fall behind. It makes it even more difficult when management doesn’t know how to manage or hold people accountable for the things they do wrong. If you don’t work and are a slacker than this place is for you....it’s full of free money. You can easily move up if you look like you’re doing something and kissing managements behind. The company doesn’t care about the associates and what life brings them...they just know you better show up even if you’re on your death bed or else. This place just rips your soul out and spits on it.,2,Current Employee,Production ,Somewhere in Philly,5/26/19,2019,5,26
Walmart,Walmart is an okay place to work for someone who needs a job for a few years. I would not recommend this company for a career unless you are a college graduate in the management trainee program.,3,Former Employee,SALES/STOCKING ASSOCIATE ,"West Plains, MO",5/26/19,2019,5,26

Productive place to work.,I still work for the company. They have treated me well and like family. Just like any other job I’m looking to learn more and be more knowledgeable.

An alright job,I loved working with my coworkers. Walmart has CSMs that manage the front end. So some managers I liked and some I didn't. Some would come when you put a code in asking for assistance or money and others would come 30 minutes after you needed them. Customers are nicer in retail than in fast food. But they get horrible around the holidays so try to be prepared for that.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Morgantown, WV",5/26/19,2019,5,26

Consistent,"The atmosphere is the biggest issue with this job. I understand jobs don't need to be fun, but it certainly is a bonus.

There was no foreseeable goal.",3,Former Employee,Salesfloor associate ,"Blaine, MN",5/26/19,2019,5,26
Fast pace work environment,"Organizing orders from walmart.com and taking them to customers in parking lot. Hundreds of orders a day, worked in team. Working harder got me more work with no pay increase. Most employees are not motivated to work.

A perfect job to have if you desire a fast pace work environment where u receive breaks on-time and are never boarded.",3,Former Employee,Walmart OGP ,"Kennewick, WA",5/26/19,2019,5,26
"Very steady pace, always something to do.","I enjoyed working at Walmart. I started out as a stocker in the backroom to electronics. Then switched to another store and started as a remodel associate and worked my way up to Department Manager. I liked everyone I worked with. It can be stressful at certain times of the year. As a manager you have to do whatever they tell you to, so you could be pulled to other places a lot. Overall I would reccomend working there it's a great place to make good money and good benefits and you can move up fast if that's what you want to do.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Easley, SC",5/26/19,2019,5,26

"I learned how to lead a team, trained future managers/leaders, solve tasks, & communication skills. They are still corrupt, though.","I learned a lot as listed, but I would not want to work there ever again. The inner politics is utterly corrupt.

It's a Job,"It is a job when money is tight or in my case being a high school student. I would never call this a career or the start of a career with the simple fact being your in a retail position.

I constantly fear for my job. They’ve made goals unreachable and everyone gets write ups all the time. Very stressful, if you’re caught talking even for less than a minute you get accused of wasting company time and a write up. If you get hurt they try not to take care of you, or make you wait for hours before you can go to see a doctor, all the while trying to intimate you out of going.

Situation Makes or Breaks,"Walmart is not the most glamorous job out there but pay tends to be pretty decent considering the hiring requirements are minimal. Benefits are decent considering the ease of getting a job and are fairly comprehensive along with very flexible scheduling. The issues that come from working for Walmart is that the situations you end up in can vary significantly based on the individual store. The ones that have fairly set longer term staff and are not overly busy and understaffed can be great. After those stores it can be a slippery slope. Most Walmarts have a lot of turnover and managers are consisently moved around making consistency a bit difficult to find. Overall, if you find a decently consistent store without a lot of turnover you could do much worse, but if that is not the case you should probably stay away.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Sioux Falls, SD",5/25/19,2019,5,25

Not a fun place to work it can be stressful if your not used to working non stop and working long hours,Health Benefits and pay rate is good the only things I dont agree with is how much the system has changed the managers dont really show they care for their employees and it has become such a stressful job due to not having the equipment you need in order to get your work done in time and having to work 12 long hours with only two 20 minute breaks can be a little hard if your not used to working the long hours also we are always feeling rushed due to how much work they want us to get done.,2,Current Employee,Unloader/Forklift Operator ,"DeSoto, TX",5/24/19,2019,5,24

Not all are the same,"I had been with Walmart for almost 3 years and I can honestly say my time there at first was great but it started taking a turn I got promoted to a department manager position was removed over coachings for side notes, one of them that was given too me was against company policy and when I brought that to the manager's attention he told me well there are stipulations too that which there aren't any in the longer run we are suppose to do side notes after 2 P.M.and that is what I did and pulled in the office afterwords because I didn't do them when i first was told about the side note, I can't say it was all bad though and in my time as a department manager I had been to other stores in the market that were fantastic sadly I was just in a store that ran completely backwards compared to the rest of the company and that isn't even just my opinion that any time I went to other stores in the market and the academy store for management training when I was asked what store are you from I would tell them and the typical response was always oh.. you are from THAT store.",2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Sebring, FL",5/24/19,2019,5,24

Walmart was a low paying job with no opportunity for success.,I like the hard working people of Walmart.  The people of Walmart were hard at work everyday and kept me motivated to complete the day.

Bad,The managers never have schedule enough staff to give the store the coverage that it need. They mostly hire kids who show up when ever they want to to make the poor staffing even worse.

Realistic First Job,This was my first job fresh out of the military while i was going to college and i worked on the summer remodeling crew (yet i was still considered a sales associate).  It was a fairly decent job that honestly didn't pay bad for the job itself. The only problem i really had with it was i worked third shift and employees are required to clock out for an hour lunch break during the day making your overall time spent there 9 hours and frankly i didn't want to take a lunch at 3 in the morning and while i understand why they did this so there were shift overlaps and there would never be a point where there would be no one in the store it was a little annoying.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Edinboro, PA",5/24/19,2019,5,24

"When i left Walmart , i had almost 40 hours of pro or vacation time","When i left Walmart i had almost 40 hours PTO or vacation time coming . I tried to get it for several pay periods , i was told in the office they trying to fix it so i could get it . Over a month went by still no money , i was told corporate made a mistake on my check and i would be getting the money . I waited expecting it . The money was never given to me . I feel it was a very unfair deal . I was treated unfairly , if they weren’t going to give me the money for some reason. Which i was never told , why didn’t they just say no your not getting anything. Instead of making me believe and wait for several hundreds of dollars they knew they were not going to pay me . So in other words The PTO you work for and save is not really yours it dose t mean anything and you certainly won’t get it if you leave . They care nothing about the people who work there , and especially not if you have to leave .",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Hutchinson, KS",5/24/19,2019,5,24
Low hours and Low pay.,Honestly sucks. You have to fight for your hours and you still don’t get any because it’s computer generated. Even though you do get an employee discount it still isnt enough to cover the fact that it’s a poor job. I’ve been there going on 7 months and i see a person leave every month. No lie. It’s a good job for a high school graduate but if you have bills find something else.,3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Warner Robins, GA",5/24/19,2019,5,24

Good Starter Job,"Good starter job but a lot of work. I really enjoy working in dairy we make sure items are stocked in our department, stocking milk and eggs, unload trucks, help other departments like produce, frozen, and meats we also take care of claims and returns. Sometimes I feel like we do everything. All my coworkers and department manager are great people and are always happy to help with questions or anything I may need help with. I work very hard and I respect all the managers, they are all very nice but sometimes do a poor job at managing (not telling people what they should be doing). You will see many people not doing a good job and slacking off, in the end the hard working people will need to make sure the job is done right and that what needs to be done is done correctly. I havent had any experiences with bad costumers I try to always say hello and ask what I can help them find, if I don't know the answer I always ask another associate and never leave the costumer with the question unanswered. My best tip is to find an experienced associate and watch and learn from them, they will teach you a lot. I learned how to correctly read labels, not to overstock shelves, rotate milk, work the baler, zone correctly, cap bins, print labels, and overall help you when you have a question or need help. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with others not doing there work. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with some great people and the satisfaction of helping costumers find what they are looking for and answer questions.",4,Current Employee,Dairy Associate ,"Boise, ID",5/24/19,2019,5,24

I learned a lot trying to get promoted even switching departments.  I was trained on all the PLE which was very beneficial for getting pallets down from the steel for myself or others, even unloading certain trucks.  When there was a big visit the stress in the managers showed because the store was not up to par and certain managers would wear the stress on their sleeve and the associates would try to avoid them.  They push you and don't pay the department mangers enough for all the work they have to do including the stocking team that is pushed to get the freight out to the floor and not bring any back.  The department managers always had to go back and fix everything the day after a truck because the associates working the freight were told to get it out however they could.

In Walmart, ranging from the workers to customers, there are a lot of differences. Differences that vary in ethnicity to thinking skills.

"Walmart cashier. Layaway, and CSM (customer service manager)","I loved working at Walmart. I started at a Supercenter when I was in high school part-time.

I was also given a 4-star cashier award which is mainly saying that you're effective and fast at cashiering. I really loved interacting with a lot of customers that would actually come through my line just because they enjoyed my chats and my quickness.

Now, as far as management with the store I was involved in, it could be tremendously better because it really is a good store and I'd hate to see it get run into the ground.

It’s retail NOT corporate, so the primary purpose for the job its all about customer service. There’s a lot of complaining about management because a majority of the younger individuals desire to stand around and be on their phones all day and when reminded that they’re  at work they would rather disrespect authority and quit. It’s definitely NOT a job for the lazy. I love assisting the customers. I think the most complaining comes from the most lazy and negative people on the sales floor.

"Good place to work, but the rules are kinda getting out of hand.","Been working there for 4 1/2 years now and when I first began it was a very busy work place OT was in abundance and the work was fun. I had a few hiccups at the start but I corrected them and it was smooth sailing. Management is very understanding and will help out as much as they can. I was in DA recieving for 2 1/2 yrs and decided I learned enough and became a yard driver, which hauls the 53' foot trailers on the yard. No CDL requirement is needed but it can help you land the promotion, because that spot is a interview position. This is the most kick back spot in the warehouse. You just do your work make production and cruise, literally. Over these few years we got 2 $1 raises within a year which now totals for yard drivers on the weekend night shift at $23.20, that's company wide. The pay levels/premiums differ according to shift but it's no less that $20 I believe. So the only thing that's a issue for alot of people are these new set of rules, they seem to be cracking down on every little issue to thin the heard because as of right now we are very over staffed and it seems to make it out that they are trying to thin the heard. Attendance, production, and other things have never been as strict but now that we are over staffed and are seemingly concerned about Amazon for idk what reason, the company wants to make it clear that we have to be straight edged and be robots. I am a hard worker, and I do my job and go above alot of the time. But I am just a number to them and there are thousands of people waiting in line to take my spot and anyone else's, and these rules seem to - more...",4,Current Employee,Yard driver ,"Porterville, CA",5/22/19,2019,5,22

Toxic/Hectic Work Environment,"On a typical day, I work freight, am 100% responsible for the cleanliness of the department, perform section work, price changes, scan outs, order from a secondary to resist outages, set modulars, plan features, perform monthly inventories, create mark downs, guide an understaffed and undertrained team, appropriately handle interactions from customers and employees, respond to multiple calls by managers over a walkie talkie.  In the months that I've been employed, I've noticed that management does not seem to solve problems effectively.  My experience is that problems that can be easily solved are instead treated as if they are the associate's fault, used as retaliation, or swept under the rug.  Training on the job is terrible, but training at the academy is phenomenal.  Most associates are focused, self motivated, and have a lot of valuable input.  It's a shame that the upper management team does not properly recognize them for their efforts.

Working for Wal-Mart,"A typical work day was fairly easy you were told what to put out on the floor and when to get it all done. While doing your job you had to stay alert to any customer needing help or any accidents that might occur. I learned how to work just about every department in the store and was always called on by other departments when they needed extra help. Management was normally ok some of them would go out of their way to help you either at work or would listen to you if you had a personal issue and needed someone to talk to. However, sometimes management would pick favorites and that made it hard to move up in areas of the store. If you were their best worker and you wanted to move somewhere else, you had a 50% chance on whether or not they let you go. The workplace was ok but a lot of times it was like being in high school dealing with drama. The best thing to do was to limit who you talked to and what was said there. Keep personal issues to yourself and away from the workplace. The hardest part of the job for me was every department would call on me at least 5 times a day every 10-15 minutes to help them while I would try to do my other jobs. This lead to more overtime for me and less time with my family. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job was I did make a handful of really good friends that I could count on, and most of the time the pay was good.",3,Former Employee,floor associate ,"Seneca, SC",5/21/19,2019,5,21

"Negative, Stressful, Poor Communication","Working for Walmart was reminiscent of high school, if high school was a multi billion retail conglomerate. Management was poor at communication and regularly broke Open Door privacy procedures, gave good hours to friends and fired the subordinates of enemies. It was a regular, childish, game of thrones type atmosphere. The money was nice but it's not worth being subjected to constant degradation from not only managers and customers, but coworkers as well.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Maumelle, AR",5/21/19,2019,5,21

Very good working environment,"A typical day at work started with immediate customer service and making sure my department was organized and stocked. I also helped customers with the cash register and when there was no customers in need of assistance I would go to the isles and make sure everything was organized and clean. By the time it was time to close my department, management would send me to other departments to help or send me to the front registers. Overall management was good. Walmart was cutlery oriented and diverse. I didn't have any difficulty with the job.

"I got my hours, managers didn't care about you except for maybe two, they only worked me when there was a team of four to five people","I worked at the customer service desk and there were at least 5 of us but I got overworked because I had open availability, only because I was told we had to have that to get the hours.  The managers didn't care about you and the environment was full of negativity and hate.  Walmart gives customers too much lead way and most of the time they came in there just to ruin someone's day because they're having issues.  The pay was decent but all of the hassle that you're given you deserved at least $15 - $17.  Also when you go into Walmart and see 50 people in line that's because they hire dam near everyone and only put 6 people on the schedule for the shift.  Half of the employees there you'll only see every so often because they're scheduled one day a week.  I wouldn't dare work for Walmart again unless it was my last resort and I highly doubt that.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Suwanee, GA",5/19/19,2019,5,19
Walmart Pharmacy,"Walmart is an okay place to work.  It is not the best place I have ever worked, but it is also not where I plan on working forever. My manager is great though and has always been very accommodating with my schedule.  I was in the system as part time and working full time hours.  I did not get paid maternity leave because I didn't know about the stipulations of paying into STD for my LOA because I did not receive a formal orientation when I was hired and was not guided through the process of going through all the nitty-gritty stuff at the beginning.",3,Current Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Prattville, AL",5/19/19,2019,5,19
"Very busy work place, sometimes a bad environment, and supervisors on your butt all the time",Never work at Walmart unless you're desperate for work and like working hard for little pay...I would say the only good thing about working there was getting free food from meetings and that they work around your schedule,2,Former Employee,Walmart Supercenter ,"Moreno Valley, CA",5/19/19,2019,5,19
good but becareful,It was an okay experience working at the Walmart. Becareful if you pick a position you want to do can be switched anytime by a manager.

"The worst employer,Very dysfunctional place to work and leadership and management is the worst ever.",Theres a reason for the turnover rate. Management is terrible and never available. No HR that you can ask questions about your benefits. No training for the Supervisors. Pay is very low for the work you do. If you make it 6 months when the benefits kick in you have senority. They have discrimination issues. They dont care about their employees. Employees are miserable. If you go to supervisir with an issue their ccx response is i dont want to hear it. They cant keep employees. The worst place ive ever worked. They cheat employees out of weekend overtime by making saturday their first day of  the week.

They do not hire anyone on full time. I have worked with this company for 3 years and is still part time. The pay rate is not bad for minimum wage. The things i liked about them is that they worked around my school schedule and you can basically set the time you can work. good company, poor management.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service/Money Center ,"Montgomery, AL",5/19/19,2019,5,19

Can be a fun place to work,"If you work with the right group of people including management, it can be a fun relaxed place to work.

Some of the management including the Main Store manager, remind me of high school with their ""click"" and favoritism.",3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Summerfield, FL",5/19/19,2019,5,19
Working at Walmart,This particular location is what made me want to work at Walmart. This store is rarely ever too crowded even on black Friday’s and what not. Very fast paced job if you are a cashier but not too much. The employees are very nice and caring. I was at this location for 2 years longer than I first expected but it turned out good.

Walmart was overall a decent place to work.,"The staff was great including management.

"Co workers were nice, the managers not so much",The managers would get you to do their jobs while promising to help you with yours but end up not helping and you end up behind yet get in trouble for going over your hours.

Fun and wonderful associates to work with,Working at Walmart is good most of the time. there are some cons to working there and a lot of Pros. I enjoy my job 95% of the time.

The worst,Walmart was a good place to work in the beginning but the longer I work here the worse it has gotten.

Definitely don’t feel comfortable around the managers.,2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Chambersburg, PA",5/19/19,2019,5,19

Toxic culture,"Worked for Wal Mart for 12 years.  just got tired of the constant new hire managers whom didnt have a clue and the unobtainable goals they had.

"Job is okay, but not worth the way it makes me feel on a regular basis","Always having to work twice as hard because everyone else isn't pulling their weight or moving with urgency has become so maddening that I feel the need to remove myself from this job and find employment elsewhere.  Management and supervision do nothing to correct people who need it, and come down on me for ""not working fast enough"".  The level of frustration I experience is not worth the money they pay me.  Literally nothing significant exists anymore to make me want to continue working for this company.  Every sign points to leaving as the best thing for me at this point after giving it 3 1/2 years of my time and patience.",4,Current Employee,CAP Team Associate ,"Monroe, WI",5/19/19,2019,5,19

Awful Management and policies that are rarely followed.,"Walmart corporate rules are rarely followed except when corporate visits, OSHA is violated on occasion without  repercussion, always fixed when they visit, and management is rarely understanding.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Waukesha, WI",5/19/19,2019,5,19
"First Job, First Impressions","I needed a source of income while in school so i worked at Walmart. At first, i used to walk in with a smile on my face but now after dealing with rude customers and unfair managers, i feel as if it is a field i can no longer work under. i have learned to disregard any rude comments made by the customers but my manager is someone i cannot stand. Someone who talks condescendingly, gives his employees an unreasonable task in an unreasonable time limit, and also talks as if he has no common sense. It has gotten to the point where I turn the other cheek whenever he opens his mouth because it is some nonsense. instead of helping out employees when overloaded, he sits in the back of the store laughing and giggling. i remember bring all my trash from my assigned aisle to the back to throw away he said with attitude ""Why are you back here instead of out there?"" i responded with ""I know you can clearly see I have multiple carts of cardboard and multiple bags of plastic that needs to be disposed."" Again, with attitude, he rushed me outside back to the floor. Literally, i had less than ten minutes till it was time for me to clock out and go home, he told me to finish an entire aisle that nobody had worked. So i clocked out almost an hour later. In my opinion, he's not a leader. He is a boss.",2,Current Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Fort Worth, TX",5/19/19,2019,5,19

Great company to get on the job experience,"Walmart is a great company to come in and learn from the ground up.  The management approach is very hands on, with limited classroom time and training.

Good luck keeping your job.,"I was tasked with working nights which means, anything the day shift didn't feel like doing was your responsibility. I would often be left with an insurmountable amount of work that was expected to be done regardless of my job description. They admit to constantly firing people for the tiniest infractions so they don't have to give people benefits. Sometimes the line at the ""time card"" machine moves slowly so have fun being 1-2 minutes ""late to work"". Regardless of your job title they will make you do anything they want without extra training or pay. I had the privilege of doing maintenance work, customer service, and my managers work for less pay than my co-worker that got hired in the same week. No matter what department you work in, they'll find a way to use you and toss you before they have to star paying you a livable wage. Do not work here unless you are a manager's brother or something.",1,Former Employee,Associate & Bakery Associate ,"Niagara Falls, NY",5/19/19,2019,5,19

Poor work place,"Working at Walmart was the poorest selection that I've made in my whole life. If you get a job as a cashier it's better to opt out yourself because the managers after a certain time would start loading you with their work too. Very poor management, no pay raises at all.

It's a good job to start out at to understand retail.,The part time/ full time associates who are not in management more or less don't care about how things get done. The motto that they go by is everyone is replaceable. The pay for what they require is not equivalent.,3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Phoenix, AZ",5/18/19,2019,5,18

warehouse experience,"A typical day at walmart is is very fast paced and productive. My time at walmart, I've learned how to stay organized, be a team player, and maintain. a safe work environment. Management is very attentive to warehouse needs as well as aware of employee safety.

High paced work environment; good & bad,"My first few months working there we had already had two store managers, we were actually short staffed most of the time which caused a lot of stress on the department. People rush to take breaks often skip you & wont let you take yours. It’s a very high school environment with this one talking about that one. Some workers slack on purpose to avoid doing their jobs. I was fired for missing days when I put in for a transfer months before I actually moved & was supposed to be on a leave of absence for a immediate family illness. Never put it in that I needed a transfer from the store manager nor did they set up the leave of absence. It’s like pulling teeth to get help from anyone higher up. Pay was okay, not sure how raises work. The overall environment outside of the department with the workers is nice, very friendly associates for the most part. If you’re hard working & willing to WORK for your money, Walmart deli is the place for you.",3,Former Employee,Walmart Deli Associate ,"Milford, DE",5/18/19,2019,5,18

"Average pay, but not enough","Walmart's pay has been historically low. They recently increased pay for new hires, but failed to increase pay for existing employees. Some employees said they are making the same as new hires and have worked for walmart over 10 years. Walmarts turnover rate is high because management treats most employees poorly. Employees do enjoy a discount card for 10% off non food items. The job itself isnt hard most of the time, but the pay isn't worth it unless you get into management.",3,Former Employee,Cashier / Electronics associate ,"Riverdale, UT",5/18/19,2019,5,18

Most disappointing job I have ever had,"Extreme favoritism. I witnessed employee's with several years of employment let go and replaced by upper management family members at full time and increased wages.

Assistant Store Manager,"The hourly employees were pretty good. Got the job done when asked to assist. Other management sucked. Didn't support or assist their peers. Treatment was brutal and without respect. I'm surprised Walmart doesn't stay in court with the number of HR concerns it has. Anyway, I wouldn't work for the company again. The pay was excellent but isn't worth it.

Stressful. Poor management. Enjoyed my job as a cake decorator. Felt like it wasn’t enough,I worked here for two years. I learned to decorate cakes as I did the job here. I enjoyed my actual job as a decorator. It was stressful because they didn’t hire another person to help for over a year. They only let me be a part time person which was also hard on me to perform the way I needed. Management didn’t know how to communicate at all.

"Stressful, Fast-paced workplace",Working at Walmart was a good decision as I was needing a job at the time. Going into the position I knew I would have to be working hard but not at the pace that we are forced to work at everyday. My department is very busy filling orders for other customers but we also have to ensure customer satisfaction on the sales floor as well as to the customers that we fill orders for. I have learned to develop more of customer service attitude as I've been working in customer service for quite some time now.

I was hired with Spanish speakers and the orientation person could not even translate anything for some people and it was a bit unorganized because now, they aren't able to know exactly what is expected at work and everything else regarding their pay, Paid Time Off, etc. Management is hard to find. If you're looking for them for something important, expect to go on an adventure; off the clock at that. The hours are very long mostly. And working 38 hours, almost full time on $11.00 pay is such a horrible thing.

Overworked,The amount of work that is required as a CSM is unrealistic. Upper management puts a lot of their work off on the CSMs. I would not mind this if my pay was greater than two dollars over the cashiers.

I only see my 12yr old son maybe 3 times a week.  I do customer service returns so a lot of heavy lifting and frustrating interaction with customers all day.  I'm physically drained and ache all over at the end of each shift.  I don't think I'm being paid enough for what I go through and would jump at the chance for a sit down job.  My co-workers are awesome and they make my job bearable.  The management is lazy at best except for maybe 2 who really try. but they rotate managers every 6 months so the good ones always leave.

People getting promoted off friendships and family relationships, not on quality or ability to do the job. _x000D_ Your store manager tells you to do something that doesnt line with company expectations, dont speak up because there will be a target on you back.  The company is loosing far to many valuable people because of favoritism and in turn bringing in outside managers with no management experience let alone retail experience.

Loved my coworkers and my management team.,"I love my coworkers and my management team. Us old schoolers who have been there for 5 plus years stuck together like one big dysfunctional happy family. I miss them all. I have learned throughout the years that management has favorites and if you aren't part of ""the click"" then you better watch your back. Thank goodness that wasn't the case for me! And if any employee went to corporate for an issue or problem within that store..WATCH OUT!

good job bad store mangers,It is a great place to work when we had strong good store managers but when we had bad ones all they did was threaten our jobs daily.

I did learn allot but their is to much favoritism from up above is who you know that would let you get away with anything and the hard workers got thrown to the curb.,4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Portland, TX",5/17/19,2019,5,17
"Great work place, this that place.",Walmart is an outstanding company to work for. It comes with great benefits (have to be here for 90days). I’ve spent 6 years with this company and I love it. It does require you to move at a fast pace. It definitely keeps you busy. But beware there are some “crowds” and may seem like high school.

"Competative, hostile enviroment.",The management of Walmart was very much so not employee friendly. Coworkers would gossip and report false claims to management if they wished to get someone fired. The amount of time worked was not worth the amount of of money in your paycheck. It was hard to advance even if you wanted to. There was always a line of people waiting to be moved up to even the simplest position of CSM.,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Lewisburg, PA",5/17/19,2019,5,17
a fun workplace with helpful employees,"working in a place where you are able to help people is very interesting, because you get to know a lot of people, you try your best to help them in anything that they need. I learn new things every single day from my managers, my co-workers, and including the customers. the hardest part of my job is when it gets busy, and sometimes we do not have many people working. but the enjoyable part of the my job is when customers come to you asking for help, and you are always there to help them.",5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Wimauma, FL",5/17/19,2019,5,17

As long as you're not a cart pusher it's a fine place to work.,"Management is poor to an extent, workplace culture for cart pushers is atrocious, constantly overworked with no foreseeable benefits of doing a good job such as a raise, bonus, or promotion. The tier list of people who actually care about you range from the average worker, CSM's, and then ends at department managers, after that unless you are suffering from a heat stroke most of management could care less about your wants and needs. So if you are going to work at Walmart please take any other position that isn't a cart pusher otherwise you're going to be used and abused until you quit or are thrown out.",2,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Niceville, FL",5/17/19,2019,5,17

Some Managers are more active than others.,"When it comes to Walmart, some would say good things or bad things, depends on the person. In my experience I had a little of both with managers and associates. There were a few managers who were not so helpful or flat out lazy, which made the experience not so good.

Managers were lazy,"I worked at walmart two different times in two different states. One was a neighborhood market, the other a supermarket. Both times I had trouble getting hr to listen to me. I would tell them plain and clear when I am available and when I am not, and they would tell me ""That's fine, we can work with your schedule."" The next thing I know, they're scheduling me times that I cant make it to work, forcing me to call in or be late. They put so much emphasis on how caring they are, but as soon as youre on board they forget about you. Its disheartening._x000D_I can admit the benefits are good, if you can stand working there over 6 months. The pay is ok, but most days, especially weekends, I'd be scanning 900 items an hour and my arms and back would be killing me.

Overall review,"There are many in the store that deserve advancement and are always overlooked. People with disabilities are not fairly treated, the feeling that you should come to work even when your disability acts up. Many managers have favorite employees and push them through to the jobs others have the education and ability to do more so than the one obtaining the job. They have also taken away the bonus for those who work hard every day. They base them now on each persons attendance.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Service Desk Associate ,"Logan, OH",5/17/19,2019,5,17
I do not enjoy my job at Walmart at all,I do not enjoy working for the Walmart company. The management team was not friendly.

I enjoyed working here,"I was a district manager for Walmart for 12 years. It was a fast paced work environment that made the days pass quickly. I enjoyed my job and the interactions with the employees and the customers. However, after 12 years my position was eliminated and the only option I had was to take a demotion as there were no comparable positions available. At that point I decided to leave the company.

Co workers are the only decent thing,"The managers I worked with didn't evaluate/ talk to you to fix what you were doing wrong, they would only criticize and try to degrade you.

So and so,"Was employed 5 years. Terminated over not finishing 2 departments in which Ive never worked in time. They switch up stories about Task Manager. Barely have items needed to finish job. The mc40 and tc70 were always snatched from 3rd shift during stocking because 1st shift cap team whines and needed them. Management switches up stories and have they own ""rules"" and their own ""favorites""...if you fall less of that..a certain manager will pick on you. The new attendance policy is the reason they lose great workers due to life happening. We even had 3 employees pass away in our facility during working, and management gets upset and gitchy when you speak on it. Mr. Sam is probably rolling in his grave at the monster his business has become",3,Former Employee,Stocker/Inventory ,Illinois,5/17/19,2019,5,17

Great team but terrible managment,"I met some of the best people working in Walmart and some were even over qualified for their position. Management however, is completely indescribable. They gossip about each other to the employees and divide the store. The scheduling is so bad that we usually had about 3 cashiers for the entire day and one person for half the store because management wants their bonus.

Good place if you want an inconsistent schedule,"Ok so starting off i know this does not apply to everyone who has or who will work here. That being said Walmart has been one of the worst jobs I've had. The management is poor and manipulative, Salaried Management continuously did not approve unpaid time off on times they said they would, or just left it pending until the week of the request no matter how far in advanced it was placed. Hourly management have a power complex and are generally terrible with few exceptions (again in my experience). Pay is decent depending on where you work but rarely enough to pay for basic expenses in the area lived in. As well the management does not work around your schedule for anything other than school (and even then they aren't to good with working around your school schedule) even though they market that they do. All in all with my experience there i wouldn't recommend it as a place to work unless you are desperate for a job",2,Current Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Iowa City, IA",5/17/19,2019,5,17

Not very team oriented,The people I worked with were not big on being a team. Several people would complain about tasks they were given or say it wasn't their job and they weren't going to do it. This made for a very stressful work environment. There is also a lack of communication between managers and managers to employees. Information is not passed along in a timely manner or when it is needed.,4,Former Employee,Walmart Mod Team ,"Waukegan, IL",5/17/19,2019,5,17

Liking watching the Titanic sink from a hall-full lifeboat,"During a regular day at Walmart, you can expect to be reminded of how low you are on the totem pole, and no matter how hard you work, nothing you do is good enough. You are expendable. Hard workers are rewarded with more work, and Lord have mercy on the poor soul who can't get someone else's job done by clock out time. _x000D__x000D_Management is a toxic mix of drugs and high school drama. Chances are, they're having affairs with each other and regular associates. In most cases, they will never be punished for this. This is on top of their complete incompetence. When live freight doesn't get stocked, it comes down on them, yet most of them refuse to lift a finger to help get the freight on the floor. Managers also like to hold vendettas and use their power to manipulate and harass associates far beyond how a regular boss would._x000D__x000D_The company itself is going down the hole. Walmart is trying to be Amazon, minus the $15 an hour starting pay rate. This is a mistake, because they will always function best as a brick and mortar store. _x000D__x000D_The Walton family may not be aware of this, but they themselves are contributing to the future downfall of the once great retail titan. They're dedication to the bottom line trumps all. In order to further fill their fat pockets, they demand hour cuts, mass firings and anything else that can cut corners to make a quick buck.

All we are is a payroll number that they want to loose to save a buck. Associates that have built this company are now having their jobs ""reconfigured"" and are left with no options but to quit or take the bad jobs that even mgt won't do.

Nerve wracking and extremely stressful,"I would never recommend this corporation for a job. There is little to no advancement now that they are trying to downsize managers. No one’s job is safe anymore as they push forward to more robots, less people. Working with the public is like working with children. Everyone feels entitled and treats you like you are dirt. Management will lie straight to your face just to get away from you. They push impossible workloads on the workers, while they sit in an office drinking coffee or on their phones. They are constantly coming up with ways to push long term workers out the door so they can hire Joe Schmo off the street for less money. Turnover is insane. Once people realize that the corporation isn’t all that the media makes it out to be, they find the door. There is no accepting of doctors’ notes, don’t EVER get sick, and don’t expect to ever spend a holiday with your family again. Run. Run as fast as you can away from them.",1,Current Employee,Department Manager ,Pennsylvania,5/15/19,2019,5,15

Now the new hires are paid better than the people who have been there a while. It is a good place to start in the workforce but it is not easy to advance in pay.

Money before everything else,"Over the last few years WalMart has phased almost all full time positions, most benefits, and is trying to keep employees below 30 hours a week to prevent qualifying for insurance coverage.  They have eliminated several positions and allocated the work to other employees, including management.  Most managers at the store level are attempting to do their best for themselves and their employees that they can, but corporate is automating work and overloading current employees to inflate their multi-billion dollar profits.  The only livable wages at Walmart are in the salaried (Assistant Manager and above) positions, but those employees are routinely expected to work 60+ hour work weeks to make up for the lack of employees at the floor level._x000D_In Missouri, at least, the ""health insurance"" offered is a $300 HFA account and a $6,000 deductible to qualify for $2,000 of coverage.",1,Former Employee,"Associate, Pharmacy Technician, CSM ",Missouri,5/14/19,2019,5,14

I wanted to grow more and more, show them what I got. They didn't give me a chance to really grow to my full potential. Main reason I left is because, I couldn't pay my bills! The only reason why I had long hours is because I had long brakes, hated that. The most they give you is 32 hours so they don't have to pay for benefits, or so the rumor was told amung with staff and managers.

Fast Paced Company,I find Walmart to be a very fast paced business. They have many opportunities for their associates.

"Good benefits, heavy management oversight","Walmart had good benefits; pto, 401(k) match, health insurance, etc. They also do a decent job of matching hours to work needs so that there's not a lot of time standing around, and, in general, there's people present when the work is. I also appreciated the lunch policy where the pharmacy would close if there's only 1 pharmacist so the pharmacist could get a lunch. That said, Walmart asks a lot of you, there's not really any room to slack off. Upper management was always poking their nose in asking why things weren't getting done, do more of this, we need more of that. _x000D_If you get a good Market Manager and get a good store this could be a great place to work.",3,Former Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,"Pueblo, CO",5/14/19,2019,5,14

I had enough PPTO (protected paid time off) to cover it and they took me out of the system as soon as I called out. Never received a call about being terminated. Never gave me a chance to put my PPTO request in the system on my next shift. If you're looking for something while you go to school or something it's great.

I always admired the way Walmart and our associates contributed to the different charities how they came together to help the community of Washington during the tornado. _x000D__x000D__x000D_My typical day started when I punched in. Went to my assigned register where I would scan products, converse with customers, bag groceries and products.

Typical Day in the Warehouse,"A typical day would consist of having to ship out around 160,000 to 180,000 cases within a 12 hour day on our weekend shift, which I work.  As the shipping manager, I would have to organize the staffing in order to complete the schedule.  This includes assigning around 50 associates task for the day.  Some would load pallets on trailers, and other load conveyable freight that would be stacked off the line, into the trailers.  The day will often be confronted with challenges with something along the lines of associates leaving work unscheduled or a maintenance issue arising, which would possibly prevent the daily workload from being completed.  When such instances come up, you have to adapt and move resources around to ensure that the business would not fail in completing its daily expectations.",4,Current Employee,Manager ,"Douglas, GA",5/13/19,2019,5,13

I would recommend working here.",4,Former Employee,person of prominence and nobility ,"Picayune, MS",5/13/19,2019,5,13
"Decent Job, Sub-Par Workforce",Any individual job at Walmart is not that bad. Most are relatively easy. The biggest issue is trying to do your job while having to make up for the lack of effort from co-workers. Difficult to want to wake up and go to work where you know no one else cares to successfully accomplish anything.,3,Current Employee,CAP2 Team Supervisor ,"Xenia, OH",5/13/19,2019,5,13

"Good for a job, not for a career","If you were full time and you worked in the right department, great. If you weren't full-time, good luck getting hours. Also enjoy being put into a department that you aren't trained for. My first day, I went to do CBL's(Computer Based Learning) and was told that because the maintenance staff called out, I would have to be on maintenance... by myself... with no training. They fully believe in the sink or swim scenario and aren't afraid to throw you in the water to see which one you choose. Now the sales associates, most of them are great. You get a few that don't work unless someone important is around but for the most part, everyone busts tail. You will make friends that you can share struggles with. But on the management level, hmm... they are there just make sure it ""looks"" good. The products are sometimes put in the wrong place on purpose, which can lead to the customer getting the wrong pricing, and can also lead to inventory believing we don't have an item, but we do!",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pooler, GA",5/13/19,2019,5,13
Amazing first job.,Walmart gave me experience in a field I had never been in (accounting) and taught me everything I needed to do the Job. Management was helpful and kind.

Let get real retail is an awful job.,"Everything is subpar, if you work there long enough you'll end up knowing more than most of your managers. They loosely follow policy and use it to benefit themselves. They also change scheduling and do not notify you, well they will send a late voicemail notifying they changed it and that you should check it, even though I believe you need to be on the clock in order to take place. Also poor communication skills. The ppto earned is worthless at the rate you accrue it, also feels like it affected how you earn regular pto for part-timers. Basically, fix the way it is accrued and hold higher tier workforce members accountable.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,TN,5/13/19,2019,5,13

Do it their way or the highway,"If you are 1 minute late you are written up. Don't believe what the policies are they change daily according to the management. Osha requires 2 20 minute breaks an a 30 minute lunch, if you leave at 6.01 hours and don't take a lunch you are written up. If they are shutting down early the take away your last break. If they want to change Something they do you are expected to comply regardless of your opinions or suggestions.With the new pay policy someone who has worked there for 14 years as myself now makes less than a person who has been there for 3 years.

An okay place to work,"Working at Walmart is not really all that terrible but depending what department you are in you can run into things that make it dreadful to come to work. Besides some of the older associates, I have to say that most associates I come across describe it as ""just a job"". A typical day at work for me is never knowing when I will get to go home for the day. I am a personal shopper and we are very very busy at my store so I will come in at 4 am and sometimes not get off until 4 or 5  in the afternoon. I can't make plans due to this and it is honestly EXHAUSTING. But when I was a cashier, life was a breeze. I had my share of difficult customers but I always remained kind and tried to be understanding. When customers would ask where stuff is, I have never been one to tell them ""this isn't my department so I do not know"". Just help them find it instead of being a lazy bum. It is incredibly hard to find associates in there (not so much since online grocery started since we are ALWAYS out on the floor) so JUST HELP THEM. You can literally look up the item on the Walmart app and it often gives a location. Also, just learn where stuff is in your store. The culture is a kind of like high school honestly. Everyone forms groups of people they like to hang out with. I would assume this happens anywhere. Management is practically useless because you can never find them but some departments are easier to find managers in such as Produce and Meat. Forget about the regular grocery aisles though. The most enjoyable part is honestly going home and knowing you have an off day.  But everyone is different - more...",3,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Carrollton, GA",5/13/19,2019,5,13

Interesting place to work,I worked at walmart for 5 years on overnight. I enjoyed my coworkers and some of the management staff. Moving up in the company was hard when I worked there because they did not teach people how to do managers job or the duties they had to take care of. From my understanding that has changed and now they have a program that changes that. As for the work enviroment it was difficult but manageable. And the managers were quite reasonable and fair and understanding.,4,Former Employee,STOCKER/DEPARTMENT MANAGER ,"Kissimmee, FL",5/13/19,2019,5,13

Because I do my job, don't kiss up and go home I'm the target my team members turn to when they mess up. My supervisor knows who's really at fault, but discards that because of blatant favoritism.

"Great for hourly, salary is taken advantage of","I know some of my issues are with my stores specifically, but much of what I heard around the overnight ASM role from a number of stores is that it is the role that gets abused more often than others. Supposed to have a fixed schedule of 4 on, 3 off, 12 hr days. In reality it is more like 4 to 5 on and 14 hour days. O/N also receives 4 fewer PTO days than day shift managers because they are supposed to work fewer hours each week, which is not the case. Salaried is also paid about 20% less than a similar narional retailer._x000D__x000D_From what I could see, hourly associates get taken well care of, but I could also see a lack of caring from many of my fellow managers. Its understandable that they are the largest retailer and require associates to meet certain levels of productivity but more and more is being expected with fewer and fewer people. _x000D__x000D_My ultimate reason for leaving was that I was tasked with unrealistic goals with minimal staffing and when I attempted to talk to my immediate manager for guidance I was insulted and berated rather than offered coaching and support (newly transferred to store which operated differently).

Certain things I don’t agree with there like you have to shave some time off if you get over time that’s not fair if you worked mores than 40 hours or 40 hours plus you should be in titled to get your over time that’s just not fair not to but that some thing like paid time off and pto they don’t treat you right with that either but I would tell anybody if you can put up with a lil drama which that’s everywhere you go theses days it’s a good job they just change if a lot of stuff since I used to work there people say they just snot fair anymore but my lady work there still now and they get bonus every 3 or 6 months with all the benefits that’s they have and a lot more other stuff so it’s a good place to work if you have never worked there and would like a change they have all kinds of positions open you can do and after your 6 months at your department you worked at you can apply to work in another department and it keeps going like that so by it’s all done you can work all over the store if you want to the fresh area pays the most that I know of right now and that he deli produce dairy bakery and the meat department. They just recently gave the whole store a raise to 11 a hour because some associate were getting under paid like the kart pushers,5,Former Employee,Deli Worker ,"Carrollton, GA",5/13/19,2019,5,13

Hardworking Company,"Going into work every day, I had a task to follow. Such as starting at 7am, CVP, scan outs on the shelf, OSCA report, section work, and capping the bins. Majority of the time, I always got  everything done in one order. The other part of the time, management may have had other tasks to do like projects on the floor for seasonal events. I learned a lot working for Walmart. For example, how to be patient, how to have time management, and how to deal with customers who are not happy. I enjoyed working at this company although it came with multiple responsibilities.",5,Former Employee,Dept. Manager ,Baytown,5/13/19,2019,5,13
Job is ok,"Job is ok for a starter, but management doesn't treat their workers right. Workers are constantly talked down upon, CSMs get away with it if there's nobody around. Now that they don't have a Zone Manager to talk to them, they get away with anything and everything. _x000D_Manager isn't too bad when you first meet him, but you'll eventually grow to dislike him. _x000D__x000D_I've seen Walmart fire coworkers for little to no reason, even if they performed well or were trying very hard.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Mexia, TX",5/13/19,2019,5,13
You are no more than a number there.,My direct supervisor was a good man.i was bullies and made an example of on a weekly basis.

Great place to work,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. I was always night shift so I got really cool CSMs working with me, though sometimes they didn't do anything but stand on their phone. For the most part, working there was fun, but when the manager was in a mood, it literally affected everyone and there was a lot of drama. I worked the max amount of hours I could as a part-timer per week and my paychecks were pretty good for a college student with a few bills. One other negative thing about working there is that if you show that you work hard and can do a lot of work, they will expect you to do everything, even things not in your job group.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"West Columbia, SC",5/13/19,2019,5,13
management is the worse!,"Management only interacts with those they get along with._x000D_Never have time to talk. And when they actually do. It's a make it fast attitude, I don't have time demeanor! And during that time don't actually give you eye contact or take you serious._x000D_Not very friendly at all. And most departmentment managers are rude and just have a nasty attitude. No career advancement at all! Unless your liked or kissing butt.They pick and choose who they want. Even if they are not right for the position. They will find a way or reason to fire those they they don't like or refuse to tolerate.They fail to see that it's not your position that makes you. It's the person behind the position. They are so ignorant. And stuck on their authority. That they fail to understand the concept of lead by example. As much as I love working at Walmart. I must say! It's the worst place I have ever worked at. There is soooo much more! But I don't think I'd have enough space on here to go on and on.

not the cup of tea,"so lets get this straight you hire someone change their schedule multiple times, constantly change what a person needs to do, send a person home sick don't except the doctors note and fire them because other managers said they don't want someone puking all over the store while they work. oh lets not forget attempting to withhold final pay check, last I checked that is a crime.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Ocala, FL",5/13/19,2019,5,13

It’s very demanding job At times very mentally stressing  and challenging.,3,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker/cashier/zoning ,"Cape Coral, FL",5/13/19,2019,5,13
Walmart Corporate,The individuals that are not working at store/club level have no clue as to how the associates are really treated. In addition the individual that decided to change the policy to reflect hourly associates PTO obviously never worked in the field. Why would you tell associates the new PTO is basically like sick time. If you call out and have enough time you could use those hours to remove the absence you recieved. But if it takes 6 months to receive 8 hours!!! Your associates have already lost. Turn over was high before now it will be really high. If you call out on a Friday Sat or Sunday its 2 points Holiday its 3. But let me ask you this..... why are we the only ones working Holidays while Corporate enjoys their thanksgiving Dinner?? No holiday pay. But if you call out its 3 points REALLY Walmart. Why to show how you care about your associates. Remember it takes 6 months for 8 hours. And everyone began with a 0 - ZERO balance.,1,Former Employee,Training Facilitator ,"Nashville, TN",5/13/19,2019,5,13

While I worked there I learned grocery, hardware, Automotive, Sporting goods, and toys stocking and bin areas. Plenty of work so your never bored, if you get done you move on to help your coworkers, or they come to help you get done. I don't think anything was hard about the job really just some days you had a lot of work and may have to get help from a coworker to get done.

Good side part time job,"Pretty good company to work for, but as I am half stocked and half cashier, I believe there should be some raise for perfor.ing both positions well, on top of that being trained for yet another position in the store. Although laid back a little bit, the store seems to get things done quite well. Hardest part is some customers, but that's based on demographics on where one lives. I definitely learned though that team work is essential in getting incredibly big tasks done. On the contrary though, you could be doing the most work yet getting paid the same as the less work driven associate. All in all, I don't mind the workplace and there's something about it I quite like.",4,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Arlington, TX",5/13/19,2019,5,13
hard place to work,Walmart is hard to work at. There is a lot of hours and not a lot of people. The management promote people that are great workers over others that bust there back. If you get hurt they talk you out or talk around seeing someone for your injury. You may see the general manager once a month for a group meeting on shifts that aren't during the day. Even if there are issues he won't come in to support workers.,1,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Cheyenne, WY",5/13/19,2019,5,13
Simple job but a physical one as well!,Day starts in mid afternoon. You come in and unload the General merchandise truck on average takes roughly 2hrs. Sort merchandise by department on to pallets or on to carts.(consumables). Take those carts over to the grocery dock area and combine the product that comes in the grocery mix pallets. Then assigned an aisle and proceed to put out. Management for my particular store is decent in my opinion. But Walmart doesn't test for drugs during employment hiring and some hires show this lack of testing. _x000D__x000D_5 point attendance system seems to be challenging to some people._x000D_Starting pay is ok but could be better if they want to bring in better people to serve they're customers. 40 hours is pretty much garanteed in this position as there is a grocery truck everyday.,3,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Toledo, OH",5/13/19,2019,5,13

Work environment was hectic and very stressful but still organized,A typical day at work was restless and we had to move as fast as possible.

Retail is not a good place to work.,"A typical day, depending on the store you're stationed at, would see most common sales associate working multiple departments due to under-staffing. As a result, the customer service throughout the store tends to suffer because most departments only have 1 or no assocates in them. There is also a severe lack of leadership from management as they're quick to bark out orders to the lowly sales floor associate and walking onward to another part of the store where they're typically not doing nearly as much work as they should be. If they're stopped by a customer for assistance, they very seldom assist and instead delegate them to the nearest sales associate. Need to call out because you're very sick or your child is sick? You'll get a penalty (maximum 5 allowed in a 6-month period) called an occurrence. These penalties can be approved by the personnel coordinator and removed if you don't have enough ""protected PTO"" to cover it to block the penalty but there's no point in asking them to do so because they'll decline without management approval who also will not approve.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Georgia,5/12/19,2019,5,12

"Two words.......""Corporate America""",Wal-Mart is a great place to work if you're at a store that has a great manager. Otherwise you are overworked and under paid. Nothing is ever recognized with individual merit if recognized at all. They push you like a robot and treat you like a number. Its all about the numbers to salaried managers and you are replaceable as much as the next guy. The training is horrible there is favoritism and a lot of inner store gossip and drama as is all big box places. Rules and policy only seem to be adhered to when there is a visit from corporate or an employee violates. However the consequences and expectations always greater than what is realistic. High turnover but not as bad since they raised the starting wage to 11.00 an hour.,3,Current Employee,Cap 1 Supervisor ,"Albuquerque, NM",5/12/19,2019,5,12

A small band of employees overworked by out of touch corporate,"A typical day at work for me could vary radically depending upon my assigned task for the day. The degree of variation certainly was not a negative, however, and served to help round out my skill set as a supervisor. My duties could range from doing accounting work, to freight,to more specialized service roles and even minor repairs and troubleshooting with some equipment in the span of a single day. In retrospect I learned a great deal about planning and coordinating with others and on my own to make a better work environment for everyone. With regards to on the management above me, they do truly do their best with what they have. The trouble with what they have--and incidentally the hardest part of the job--was the overall lack of incentives and supplies to retain workers at the store. Coupled with poor leadership above the store level, these issues compounded to the point where the staffing would be so scarce that the work load would be highly stressful. That being said, I did truly enjoy working with many of the people around me and that sense of camaraderie will be missed. Another enjoyable aspect of the job was interacting with people in a way to help them in any capacity, sometimes even trading jokes and stories with people shopping when they were up for it. I suppose the most honest assessment I can give is that the people I worked with most closely at the store worked diligently in the face of some daunting circumstances and they were enjoyable to be around and work with; the experience was greatly soured by a less than stellar corporate vision and direction.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Bellingham, MA 02019",5/12/19,2019,5,12

Company policies in need of change,"If you can handle walking non stop for 10 hours and being pushed to go faster, you may like this job. I began working for Jet in February. I had high hopes of working my way up and building a lasting career with them. When you first start you are allowed 5 absences. These are referred to as points. If you go over within the first 90 days, you are terminated. I can respect and understand having company policies in place, however there are times when rules can and should be bent. I had used up my 5 points rather quickly due to finding a shoe that could take my feet between 5 to 12 miles of constant walking on cement floors. I was actually enjoying the job. One night they put me in shipping, for the entire 10 hours. You have to realize that some of these boxes weigh up to 50 pounds and are so big you literally cannot handle them in a manner that is comfortable. My arms were hurting so bad I was in tears. The next day I could not move let alone lift my arms. The pain was real. I called, then messaged HR to let them know there was no way I could work. I was told I had no points to spare. Unfortunately I could only do what I can do and I did not go in. Sure enough I was terminated. I find it sad that a company cannot look at the individual and take into consideration a situation that could have been forgiven. I believe that if every member of the office working staff would be required to work in the warehouse for 10 hours, 40 hours a week, they would soon change their attendance policies. It is clear that when they start telling employees how their safety and well being is priority, - more...",3,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Sparks, NV",5/11/19,2019,5,11

Their alright,Wal-Mart is a decent place to work if you are maybe a high school student. I would not suggest making a career out of it.

They do not accept doctors notes.,2,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Ooltewah, TN",5/10/19,2019,5,10
"Good for money, thats it",I loved some of my coworkers at walmart. a few people made it enjoyable for me. but over-all the authority figures weren't the best.

I love my job however there is no work/ family balance,I have learned so much from being with this company for 14 years.  The benefits are great for my family.  I love what I do and Iam good at it.  However scheduling is what has me seeking elsewhere in hopes that I find a company that allows me to have a consistent schedule for my family structure.  I can't raise my children (10 and 3) the way i feel they need with the schedule that Walmart has given me.

Fast paced but super understaffed,"There's always a need for change in our system, and management not only doesn't do it, but doesn't seem to be bothered by their upset workers and customers. You get scheduled from time to time outside your availability or maximum/minimum required hours. Management will USE YOU to cover or help in areas that are above your pay grade. Not to mention that part is illegal. It's poor management, no bonuses, and getting treated poorly by some managers and most customers that really makes it not worth your time applying.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"San Marcos, CA",5/10/19,2019,5,10

"It's okay, but beware.  Always have an exit plan.","Walmart is an okay first job. However, it really depends what location you work at, or if your managers are cool or not. In the time that i have been there, upper management has gotten more strict overall, and has added pressure to the individual stores.

Walmart,Since working at walmart i believe grocery stores to be purgatory on earth. the training was minimal and unhelpful. often times i got pulled from my own position to cover a job i was never trained on how to do. very stressful for that reason and due to the customer is always right mentality.

Good pay if your on salary but you will sacrifice any life you had.,Very unhealthy work environment.  The position has caused many people their physical and mental wellness.  The processes home office puts in place change on a monthly basis and are rarely ever successful.  So no one really knows what they are doing half of the time.  With such a big company if they actually employed and gave enough hours to the people that are needed to run the store sales would go up tremendously because shelves would actually be stocked etc but they don’t year after year they are getting rid of more and more key positions and people.  Store managers among others get fired and stepped down all of the time if they can no longer create miracles 365 days a year.  I could go on but I think you get the picture.,1,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Happy Valley, OR",5/10/19,2019,5,10

She let me work till meal break then said before you go to meal come see me in the office. She fired me. Never looked at me told me to sign papers. I went to her mgr then district manager and they repeated what she had said. Corporate was no help either.  I tried reapplying after 6 months and they won't hire me back. They state other associates say I treated them badly. However when I go into th store my associates ask me when I'm  coming back. I think this is unfair as the only reason on my record is absence.

A decent work place that often picked the pace randomly and had stressful moments.,Wal-Mart is a decent store to work at with decent pay and wages but there are times where management could have been better. The stress can be unnerving some days depending on the day and often than not it's as if the day drags on with no end in sight.

My Walmart was very depressing and discreditng,"I was one of the ""lucky"" brave souls to push carts. In my interview, I was promised water and unlimited breaks during harsh conditions and stressful situations, etc. Also recently finding out that I was hypoglycemic, I was granted an extra 5-10 minute break on top of my 15 min break or 1 lunch. But my management was very uncomphrendable and ""forget""of what they had promised.  Not even to mention how they'd gladly recognize employees for the dumbest of things such as fixing at mat that was crooked or wearing their badge. Meanwhile I'm sweating my a** off bringing wheelchairs to older people that are almost unconscious and awaiting an ambulance and I get no recognition whatsoever. There's days I'd skip my last break as a closer to ensure that every cart was put up so overnight didn't have to work even harder. And that would most of the time be me, myself, and I, alone in one of the biggest Walmart parking lots  in my district. Over time work just became unbearable, I became depressed, lost over 40lbs, (I promise oml) and just became careless about everything I loved before. I lost friends and missed family events because of lack of schedule flexibility. Went through lots of tragedies without sympathy or leverage. Management talks to you like you're fresh off the short bus and degrades you even when you're trying your best alone. The pay was amazing but definitely not worth the abuse. Even being the most helpful, polite, down to earth person that you can be, it will never be what they're looking for, they're more wrapped up in getting to know the other new mangers better than their - more...",1,Former Employee,Cartpusher ,"Marion, IL",5/9/19,2019,5,9

Every scenario is different, but it can definitely work out in your favor, Walmart is a pretty relaxed, laid-back, self-orientated job, You can really focus on you, and not deal with too much stress, because it’s very self-oriented as far as your personal working experience, you can really build yourself along different positions you try.",4,Former Employee,CASHIER/SCO Host ,"Irvine, CA",5/9/19,2019,5,9
People good upper management bad,"Being a salary manager we forced to do what we do not want to. we are to run a business and instead of listening to what we have to say to them, they ignore us.

Depending on the store and management,"For the first 2 1/2 years I worked at walmart as a cashier from (2014-2016) I enjoyed it, I had funny and cool coworkers along with some nice managers which made working there good regardless of some customers. Then towards ending of 2016 to beginning 2017 when new management came everything went down hill, walmart started to change some of their policies from attendance, uniforms, cutting hours. But working where you don’t speak or understand spanish is difficult! They were rude and disrespectful and some of the managers had favoritism towards some of the employees. Certain holidays or days they would feed us food, desserts and treats. Depending on the manager if you need to change your schedule or get days off you can. When it came to holidays is when you can take advantage of overtime or times when the store was pack with customers. Being a cashier was stressful at times when the lines was super long, customers would bring up things that didn’t have a price tag on it, customers card didn’t work, or saw a different price for an item which had to get approval from the csm. When the lines were long was a hard tasks when you needed management where there were sometimes like 2 available and like 5 cashiers flashing their light. The occurrences for late or no show was I think 9 and they weren’t so hard on you. Fast paced but it helped time go by quick only if you had straight customers coming through your line. Sometimes having a long line made you take your breaks or lunch a little late",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Hialeah, FL",5/9/19,2019,5,9
Management Sucked Corporate's Peepee,"Yeah, you know, maybe if Walmart wasn't so busy bullying their suppliers and employees equally, they'd have time to stick their sleazeball womanizer management into personality improvement programs instead of letting them retaliate against workers by dress coding them when they just don't want to drive 4 hours to work at an understaffed Walmart across the state.

If certain people dont like you, you will never advance. If you dont kiss butt or play managers pet it will be very hard. You cant just be an employee who shows up, works hard follow policies & get respected. & The minors are the ones who get babied the most! I was trained in 7 areas & around holiday time i was dragged into so many areas in a single shift & every single person who got hired on for seasonal i trained & got used & abused like crazy & could never make managers happy because i was one person & was needed in multiple areas due to being understaffed / lazy staffed. & They ended up going from 9 pts in a 6 month period to 5 pts for attendance & all these other rules, & you get watched daily & a survey done on you which makes it even more stressful because some people do not want to engage with you at all & makes you look bad! & They barely give hours after the holiday because so many get hired on & then its not needed & then you cant even afford your bills & to make ends meet. The only nice thing is, is being able to have 9 minutes to be late after your scheduled time. Was told i would become a CSM which is why i was multi-trained & multiple others were told the same & never happened for me nor them & they’re still with the company , they - more...",1,Former Employee,Multiple Positions ,Unknown,5/9/19,2019,5,9

Fast Paced and can be stressfull,"A typical day would depend on store traffic. On slower days, mgmt. would often try to find busy work for cashiers when they would be overstaffed.

It's Walmart...,"Honestly, if it wasn't for such bad management it would probably be a good place to work at. The coworkers are awesome. But again, management doesn't actually care about its associates. It claims it does and ""it's listening,""  but this is not the case. _x000D__x000D_I was embarrassed to work at a Walmart, but I really needed the money at the time so I eventually got over it. The customers are probably the worst that an associate will meet. You do get some good ones._x000D__x000D_Overall, don't work here unless you really need the money.

Overview,"A typical clock in at 9pm followed by about 10 to 20 minutes of running on the cash register. I would do reshop, collecting misplaced items throughout the store followed by categorizing reshop items by department. Myself and other cashiers would take turns running the register and putting reshop items back/ filling out claims until everything was done. _x000D_Management is typically orderly and fair, hearing out issues and comments and working to assist in solving problems. _x000D_The hardest part of working is when there is a lot of work but limited workers. Managers expect the work of five people to be completed by only two which causes conflict as sometimes there is sometimes rushed work or there are complaints by management. _x000D_Enjoyable times are when coworkers come together to assist one another to help work get done quicker and more efficiently, and when we interact and talk to make time go by faster and to lift spirits.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Tappahannock, VA",5/8/19,2019,5,8
Management very poorly trained on how to interact with associates,"Constructive criticism comes in the form of belittling you not at all helpful in any way. Managers are very poorly trained & downright lazy, some obviously don't know how to be a manager. Too many dept managers who do not know how to assign work.

A job that provides financial stability but unnecessary stress,"Working at Walmart provided a decent level of financial stability for me; however, it added an unnecessary amount of stress.

Don't work here if your trying to make a living or need benefits.,"At first I was getting 40 hours a week. Then we we're all cut back, got between 30-33 which I guess was good compared to others. They keep you at part time so your not eligible for benefits. Right!? Who needs those!! A lot of drama with particular employees. Dept. I was in was poorly managed.

"Work to start, work to move up, don't stay.","Wal-Mart is a wonderful place to start a career. You get promoted in as little as six months, if you're patient skilled, and hard working enough. But in order to get promoted, someone has to like you, and people can promote others based on solely that. A store can have as many managers as it needs (decided by the market) and having too many cooks in the kitchen usually creates more problems than it solves. Every day, a member of management would come up to me and absolutely contradict what the previous member of management said yesterday. While some managers prove immediately that they know what they're talking about, others will prove the opposite. One of my assistant managers worked in the same area for years and didn't know how to operate/complete daily tasks within that area. Assistant managers get paid about 60k a year, plus raises, and it's not an entry level job. Communication is part of their job and Wal-Mart really fails with it. Don't stay in Wal-Mart.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Brooklyn, CT",5/8/19,2019,5,8
Great job if you enjoy physical work,"I worked here about a year and a half while I was in college and enjoyed it for the most part. I met some great coworkers, most management was friendly, and I learned my job very well. I worked second shift which was a bummer at times, due to the hours. Since my team was always low on people, you could always pick up hours if you wanted and work full time. After a while though, the job felt robotic, doing the same thing everyday. I liked being in one touch the most since I could work on my own, though it's very physical work and a lot of continuous lifting and pulling carts & pallets. Being on the truck line and stocking freight is okay, but the supervisors really get on you about time limits and getting things done. It's difficult when you don't have the people, but they have the same expectations no  matter what. I wanted to switch positions, but could never get off that team, which is the reason I left. It's difficult to leave cap 2 and hard to move up, even if you're a good worker. The hardest part of the job was basically the physical stress of keeping up.",3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Lewisburg, PA",5/8/19,2019,5,8

It’s okay,"CAP TEAM - CAP TEAM 2 was nothing less than the hardest workers of the store. Im not saying that to sound stubborn or stuck up, but it is the brutal truth. As a CAP Team 2 , unload the trucks that were delivered from the warehouses and stock the merchandise. We literally unload and stock everything that you see or buy in Walmart including groceries. Trucks, ranging from 1000-3000 + pieces, are delivered daily and must be unloaded within 2 hours in order to maintain the satisfactory of the store. Afer the trucks are unloaded we are assigned certain parts of the store which we stock until everything has been worked and / or taken to the back. All which must be done before the shi fis over. It's not as hard as it sounds, it is just a lot of work to do. If you like to be busy all day like i do then you could fit perfectly at Walmart Cap 2.

Management makes or breaks your overall experience,"In my opinion managers are chosen based on who can talk well not work well. The hard workers are held in their positions because its hard to find motivated people who actually work with a since of urgency and competency. So this leads to a deserving employee moving on to other companies with hopes of being recognize and promoted. The health and 401k benefits are great, if you can afford them. If you have a family hopefully your spouse has a job because the starting pay rate is good for single life not family life.

If you want to just collect a paycheck for doing nothing just get the job and you are golden because there is absolutely 0 accountability anywhere.

management has no clue what they are doing,They run you into the ground 11hr days only 2 20 minute breaks. Unrealistic expectations that management can't even meet yet we are held to that standard.,1,Current Employee,Loader ,"St. James, MO",5/6/19,2019,5,6

Very clique oriented at the store,"If you ever work in a Walmart,  it can be a good place,  as long as managers never play favorites and follow protocols for advancement.  Promotion of friends is a common practice,  but they don't tend to cross the line on conflict of interest. _x000D__x000D_The pay is not conducive to long term stays with this company.  The longer you stay, the less value you feel,  unless you promote, and in some stores, you better be friends with the boss to get it or you will get used._x000D__x000D_Some stores really are by the book. And they do what is truly right by promoting the right people to the right places.  I was unfortunately in a store that didn't practice this on a consistent basis.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"McAlester, OK",5/6/19,2019,5,6
Great customer service and productive place to work.,"Working in the tire and lube department for Walmart is a very busy place. Customers depend on you to make sure you are checking their vehicle the correctly, and doing everything you can to make sure the customer is satisfy with the work you did.",4,Current Employee,Technician ,"Breaux Bridge, LA",5/6/19,2019,5,6
"Started out ok, but then got worse.",Between the inconsistent management and co-workers who were to busy standing around talking trash about others it used to be a good place to work.  The management teams that now run these stores are to busy ignoring issues and playing their own games to see that people who work hard and are trying to keep their heads about them are going to lose it.  The pay is not enough to support a single person much less people who have families.  Home office is more concerned on how to get rid of associates then how to keep them and the customer happy.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Peoria, IL",5/6/19,2019,5,6
Horrible Experience,Supervisors not on the same page.  Discrimination of overweight people.  Negative talk of employees to other employees not in management position.

Does NOT follow company policy,"Sorry place to work, poor decisions made by home office. You get less than 20 minutes to eat lunch.

Walmart culture,Walmart can be a fun place to work also highly stressful as a normal associate I never had any real trouble with management.

A 16 year associate,I have worked for this company for 16 years. Job promotions are not based on what you know..... It’s who you know!!! Management tell you to apply for a position already knowing who they are goin to choose. It doesn’t matter how many years or experience  you have with Walmart.. It’s simply being in the click with management!!!  Walmart use to be a family based place to work and associates use to care.. Now it’s just a place to earn a check.. Sad to say that but its true!!,3,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Wilmington, NC",5/5/19,2019,5,5
DC is up and down,"The Walmart Distribution Center is a great place to work if you need money; you can make up to 22/h plus incentives. The work is hard, but doable. The managers are horrible, and not doable. There’s a grey area between doing the best you can do and doing what’s expected of you that you constantly have to fall into or you won’t like the consequences. For example, the managers will get on you for only doing what’s expected of you but will not applaude you or recognize when you do the best you can do. I have been working there for 2 years constantly outperformering my coworkers and giving my all every night just to have the people in the grey area get picked for the easiest jobs such as wrapping, chase work, cleaning, and training. It’s a very frustrating environment in which one who always goes above and beyond will not feel at home. If you want a regular job where laziness and avergeness are applauded, by all means go for it. But if you’re one of those people who want to show the world what you can do, and what kind of person you are and how hard you can work for goals, go to another corporation.",3,Current Employee,Order Picker ,"Robert, LA",5/5/19,2019,5,5
Unorganized management,This review is only for one store REGION 5 store #2667 Dallas Texas_x000D_Management is terrible & they expect you to do a lot more than they pay.

Micromanaging and disorganization run rampant,"Work is not complicated in and of itself, however an abundance of low-level and middle management as well as a lack of communication make it difficult to work efficiently. Furthermore, management blames its own poor decisions on its employees and subsequently effectively ostracizes otherwise competent people, as well as establishing a combative relationship between themselves and the workers at large.",3,Current Employee,Maintenance ,"Elizabeth, CO",5/5/19,2019,5,5
Hectic to say the least,"You were expected to work over three other departments, and good luck getting help from your coworkers. The department would hire high school students that had no interest in labor and customer service.",3,Former Employee,Photo Technician ,"Bonham, TX",5/4/19,2019,5,4
Worked well with me,"Most days were pretty good, and when I started having troubles with my depression, they worked with me. I only really liked one of the supervisors, didn't really know the managers. I really liked working on cap team two (before everyone started dropping like flies) and cashiering. On cap team two, we all worked together to get the job done. I also liked how both jobs made me busy and there wasn't a lot of time off. What I didn't like was that there was a time limit on the cap team two job and I often couldn't do what needed to be done in time.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Sterling, CO",5/4/19,2019,5,4
Poorly Managed,"If you are searching, continue to search! Regardless of your skill set you will do better and be appreciated elsewhere. Management is horrible!

Sorry to say they just dont care about people there,To many managers have there favorites. With there new system unless you work all hours. I use to get 30 hours a week but since they started this new system many people have quite because they have kids or other obligations in life besides Walmart and they began to not work at all around your hours leaving you with under 20 hours a week which after 11 years not acceptable. So was forced you might say to find a new job so I did not lose my home and could pay bills. Personally  I see a fall in the kingdom there with all that is going on. Been there many years so were others and this place is just going down hill every year  I was there.,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Festus, MO",5/4/19,2019,5,4
"Hate it , people get away with murder",Walmart isn't what it use to be.

And people who do their job get told they need to do more.,1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Walker, LA",5/4/19,2019,5,4
Good place to work for a little while,"Walmart has good benefits. Working there is pretty good. It really depends who you work with, and how much management stays on slacking people. Sometimes good workers have to pick up the slack of bad workers, which causes them to be burnt out. But if you are a good associate, you can move up in the company.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Support Manager ,"Columbia, SC",5/4/19,2019,5,4

Enjoyed being a people greeter,Could be a fun place if the management was fun to work with they never smiled or spoke to any one.  People greeters have to stand for st least 7 to 8 hours a day they didn’t believe in anyone sitting down when working in lawn and garden provided no shade stood in the hot weather,2,Former Employee,People greeter ,"New Braunfels, TX",5/4/19,2019,5,4
It was a job,It was a place of employment where I was used and abused.

Used to be great,"Was a great company when I started 10 years ago. Now, good luck getting your own truck and any weekends off. I had my truck taken off of me after 7 years with the company and was forces into a slip seat situation. Depending on where you run out of, wait time can be a lot and miles can be few. I finally left after 2 straight months of averaging 300 miles per day. I may have stayed, but In those same two months I couldn't even get the manager to talk with me. He would just hide in his office. The equipment is maintained very well the pay is good if you can get the miles or activities and a first-year driver will get 5 weeks between PTO and safety days. I was at 8 weeks. They micromanage everything you do and have cameras in the truck. The camera is outward facing but it reflect off of the windshield so they can still see you. This is not the same company I hired on with and had turned into a job I dreaded going to every week.",2,Former Employee,OTR Truck Driver ,"Shelby, NC",5/4/19,2019,5,4

Not for a career,Work load is too high for the amount of people employed yet they company still cuts hours and jobs so that stock holders and CEOs can make millions. Management is constantly threatened by market managers about having to stay over and have days off cancelled so as to punish those who do not meet impossible goals . Salary increases are few and they want management to give associates “solid” ratings which is usually 2% increase.,3,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Easley, SC",5/3/19,2019,5,3
"Stressful, Poor Management","The higher management at Walmart have no idea what they are doing. They are reactive to everything and not proactive.  Turnover is high, morale is poor.  They only hold those who actually work accountable and the slackers get a free ride.  The company likes to look good in the public eye on the news with giving out money but behind the scenes they do not treat their employees well.  You work all holidays. Department managers even have to come into work Christmas Night.  Nobody gets to do the job they are suppose to do because they are busy finishing someone else’s job.  I can go on and on but I think this is enough to get my point across.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,Florida,5/3/19,2019,5,3
Please read before you apply,"When I started the managers and he staff talked up the job and said it was the best place to work. They have ok osh benefits the health insurance is expensive just for a household of 2. And that was a pain to get in the first place. Then they promise you 10 hour days 4 days a week...that is a huge lie! Then when that is brought up they say ""well there is nothing we can do about that, which I do not believe. So they work you anywhere from 12 to the limit which is 16 hours a day, so there is no life balance while you work during the Week. And when you are off on the weekends your body is in constant pain. If you get hurt on the job they either treat you like you are lying or try to push the fault and blame on you even when it is not always preventable, which ends in you getting a point on your ptl which is like a write up.

Working at Walmart...,"Working at Walmart takes a special person. Especially the one I had worked at because it was considered to be in the poorer side of town. All the sketchy people would go there, and all the Burningman goers would be there as well. And it's even crazier when it's the beginning of the month because all the foodstamp recipients are around. This job will literally test your patience with handling people. You've got to be able to move quick, and have enough patience to deal with literally thousands of customers a day. Most management employees here were quite kind, helpful and polite, but just like any job, there were some who seemed to just think they were better than anyone else. Thankfully there were only like one or two of those.. The hardest part of this job are the customers who think they're so entitled that they shouldn't have to wait in the same line as foodstamp recipients and people who don't have enough money when they shop that they need to return a few items from their purchases. The most enjoyable part is when I got to see the regular customers who always return and are always buying vegetables and fruits for their young children. The children were always so polite and friendly, and they always remember our names.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Reno, NV",5/3/19,2019,5,3

The hardest part of the job would have to be just taking things personal, and sometimes caring too much. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people.

Don’t get sick,Don’t get sick or get sent home because you will be fired within a snap of a finger.

Awful,After catching the flu I put in all of the required paper work for the time I would be out of work 3 days at the most and my manager instead told me he was just going to fire me because he had no need for employees that couldn't show up to work,1,Former Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Silsbee, TX",5/2/19,2019,5,2
Very Stressful,I have worked at Walmart for 4 years my first two years was OK but as time moved on things have gotten horrible. Management don't care about the third shift at all we are always responsible for cleaning up after other shifts and our complaints go unanswered . The job requires you to do so much and when you are not able to finish you hear the complaints from the other shift managers when we never have enough people to cover the night load. By the time I leave in the morning I'm  stressed out because I'm expected to do three departments in one night with no help holidays included and it's just not fair for one person to be expected to do so much the company needs improvement they want to keep there workers.,3,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Wilmington, NC",5/2/19,2019,5,2
No outside life,Honestly I enjoyed my time at Walmart in the beginning. Then my favorite manager left and everything went down hill. My off days got switched around and because of that I never got to see my boyfriend! I didn’t have my own life anymore Walmart consumed it! Then I put in to get my points taken off because of a (work related) injury and they still denied taking my points off! I’m still paying for the drs today! I also may need surgery! My managers and store managers where amazing but honestly Walmart itself isn’t a place I would want to work for! I seems good because of the competitive pay but I stood there 8-9 hours a day in one spot! Everyone hates the self checkout host! I also had to take on csm  responsibilities when I wasn’t one! I tried to move up to become a csm and I couldn’t even do that because of my injury! The system of Walmart is messed up and they don’t take time to understand hourly associates. They assume the store managers can handle that but they have to much on their plate as well! It’s just a very stressful job all together!,3,Former Employee,Self Checkout Host ,"West Monroe, LA",5/2/19,2019,5,2
Really fun place to work with few downsides.,"I actually really enjoyed working at Walmart. I was allowed to be myself and everyday was fast paced so it never got boring. I also felt I got a lot of training. I worked there for only a year but at the end I could cover just about any floor position. The employees are super sweet and helpful too. It became like a family, I still have a lot of friends I made working together at Walmart. _x000D__x000D_There were a few downsides though, there wasn't ever enough employees so us floor associates usually got called to cashier. And when that happens it usually makes you behind on your own tasks. I noticed that a lot of the managers didn't communicate with other managers, so you'd have 2 or 3 managers all telling you do to different things and never knowing which one to listen to. But usually if you go to your direct manager they will help you.",4,Former Employee,Floor Associate ,"Blaine, MN",5/2/19,2019,5,2

Depressing,Walnart is a large company that does not treat their employers like real people with lives. They recently passed a new point which makes it easier to fire people.

Stay Away,Sam Walton is spinning in his grave. There are wayyy too many managers telling you opposing things to do and complaining when you dont finish tasks. Permanently short staffed.

Want to leave before I'm stuck there forever....,"Cake decorator at Walmart. The ONLY cake decorator at my Walmart, for an entire year! Hiring people suck and if you show you CAN do a job by yourself, they will give you no help at all and leave you ALONE FOR A YEAR.

Ive been there long enough (7-8-ish years!) and as some people on here have already mentioned, their new ""policy"", a.k.a.

"Stressful, with very little opportunity to move up","To begin, I worked for Walmart for 2 years and made the same amount of money as those that had just came into the job within the last 2 months I was there. I voiced my concerns to management, but they didnt care and told me there was nothing that they could do about that. Follow that up with management playing favorites and promoting those that they want to promote, and it was just an unhealthy, stress filled environment. Don't get me wrong, my direct supervisors were great. Then they hired a new second supervisor after that one stepped down. He had no idea what he was doing and when trying to help him he would get me coached which eventually led me leave the company. I would have loved to stay honestly, as I hate moving jobs, and I try to excel at anything that I do. Despite this, it wasnt enough for Walmart to want to try and retain me. I'll miss some of the coworkers that I had, and thats probably the only good thing I have left to say about the experience.",1,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Auburn, AL",5/1/19,2019,5,1

Yet nobody can do it in the times alloted, most cheat and still have diamonds showing but management says nothing to them because they have been there awhile and if you mention it they tell you that you should coach them. Over night stocking has turned into over night zoning and although the whole store gets zoned YOU neeed to speed up, YOU are taking too long, YOU are too slow, etc., etc., Though others are only pulling one item up, ignoring the fact that an item is in the wrong place, leaving returns behind items, ignoring the items facing number and leaving diamonds all over the aisle, and obviously working at half your pace, not sweating like you and obviously much more relaxed at their pace, YOU are the problem.

Fine place if you can work in chaos,This company has made some of the worst changes possible in 2018-2019. The worker no longer has a feeling of accomplishment nor do you feel valued by management. Lack of readily available schedules from home/phone have led to no call no shows due to employees not being informed in a timely manner. Scheduling outside an employees availability and then holding it against them with the new point system has led to firing long time associates.

High Risk High Reward,"Yearly Low Employee Retention Rates cause rampant low morale. The Cold-side shift is cramp and overworked, leading to an unsafe environment to work in, which often contributes to employee loss due to time requests off, injury, or termination. Dry side employees are often pulled from their side to work the cold-side shifts. Hiring rates are lower than retention rates. If this rate continues, it would be hard to see this warehouse continuing at this location. A shame because Walmart NEEDS successful warehouses. Positives? Good pay in relation to similar work. Benefits. Mix of positive staff and non-positive staff. When I started having health problems in relation to cold side, I found Walmart's accommodation policy requires their workers to file with a third party instead of directly with HR. After my request for an accommodation was denied I felt some members of management in cold side tried to influence me to quit my job instead of seek termination so as to protect the company's interests.

A lot of work not enough people,It has gotten to the point where the only thing I like about my job is the hours I don’t like coming in anymore. This location is very unorganized currently looking for another job at the moment. I’m tired of being blamed because work isn’t getting done & I'm tired of my availability changing because of THEIR needs.

Started nice but Management,"The recent overhaul of the attendance policy took away any part-time employee under 3 years paid time off away.

Save yourself the stress,"At first, I'd actually enjoyed working for Walmart. I've been an overnight stocker and CAP 2 associate. The longer I stayed, the more I felt the benefits they offered were like a bribe to get you to stay and deal with their constantly changing bull.

Management was very unresponsive and ignorant.,"I adored my actual work at Wal-Mart. And it paid pretty well. However, management routinely turned a blind eye to a specific worker who verbally assaulted other associates. When bringing this up to them, they told me simply to stay away from him and not listen to him. The issue with this is that on O/N Maintenance, we must work closely together. A friend of mine has informed me that this is continuing since I've quit the job. Management also demanded that O/N Maintenance also do all of the Stockman job description, meaning we had very little time for various special projects they also demanded we got done.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance ,"Blackfoot, ID",4/28/19,2019,4,28

Review,"Overall I would have to say that when I worked for walmart in the late 90's they were very family oriented. This time around being a single parent with three school aged children and a mother who was terminally ill, they did not provide myself and my family with any support. When my mother passed away I didn't even receive a card or anything not only from my department which was pharmacy, I also got nothing from the store manager as well.",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Mount Pleasant, SC",4/28/19,2019,4,28

So much favoritism going on in the Online Grocery Pickup department,"When OGP got a new manager, she turned the whole place into an extremely stressful work environment. Our pickup lot only has space for six cars and half the time we had just about double that. She would hire about ten new people but none of them worked the shift that we needed (closing). she also hired her best friend and promised her a management position just after two weeks of working there (Walmart policy says you need to work for at least 6 months before stepping up) and even with that it was a problem because it was a conflict of interest; of course she would have a bias towards hiring her best friend so they could work together. When she was gone, she would leave her best friend in charge and we would be late on every pick and customers would be angry and she would just leave at her scheduled time, leaving the entire mess to be picked up by the minors with no department manager, sometimes leaving up to two hours after scheduled time and being called “lazy and just not wanting to do the job” the next day if we left hours after we were supposed to and not having finished. We would have to call for help from other departments because two people (us closers) can’t handle several hundred late picks and multiple customers outside complaining about the long wait.  She also had absolutely little to no respect for minors. Walmart policy is to give minors in high school their school activity days off, she would reject half of them because she wouldn’t have someone to close that day (I wonder why). She had even rejected our graduation days because “[she’s] trying to run a business - more...",3,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Salt Lake City, UT",4/28/19,2019,4,28
Started out great,"I began working there in 2010 and we had a Manager at that time who would bend over backwards for his employees and really went out of his way to ensure we were treated fairly and felt respected. 3 big things changed for the worse: 1. that Manager left to go work for another company and his replacement was someone who had no business in that role. 2. the overall culture and dynamic of the corporate leadership changed, the emphasis shifted to profit instead of customers and employees. 3. we changed to a warehouse that was closer to our location but was small and could not handle our orders. Pallets were never organized as they were supposed to be which essentially doubled our task times, along with damaged products (heavy things on top of light things, etc) and there was no effort whatsoever from any of the managers or supervisors to fix the situation. The problem with Walmart is that the local managers are given no control over their own stores, everything comes from the top down with no regard to store-level concerns, staffing, management, etc. Moreover I missed out on numerous pay raises because I had worked there for a long time. I was there 7.5 years and making just pennies more than brand new people with no experience. The problem is that nobody gets the company wide raises unless they are new enough and make below a certain wage already. Those who have been there for years are often left out. The only way to ever move up with pay raises is to quit and come back and hope you get in with the ""new crowd."" Outside of the amazing benefits package, I really have nothing good - more...",1,Former Employee,Cashier-3 months ,"Fargo, ND",4/28/19,2019,4,28

Fast pace and always changing,Management in most Walmarts are good but always put too much work on your plate. Delegating is primary key to not being over worked if you have the staff in your area.

The work environment is not great, the management do not care about problems that occur with hours or trying to be more flexible with people’s schedules. Working at Walmart feels as if you don’t actually work at the position you signed up for. At one point you can be on a cash register an the next they will throw you outside to push carts without any sort of heads up before coming in to change clothes.

Good associtates and team players to work with.,A typical day at work is walking into 5-6 trucks waiting to be checked in. It usually takes the first 2 hours to catch up on all the vender's arriving.

Then UPS Fedex and Fedex espress arrive and I check in all packages through handheld computer and then deliver to appropriate departments in the store.

Miserable place to work,"Your basic a slave work horse. They fire people to save money then keep a few people to operate abs stock the entire store, it doesn't matter what Department you work in, you will pull freight to the floor and stock every department so they can save money by not hiring more help.  So customers needing help in a specific department will wait longer just received that help because if you work in hardware you could be stocking groceries on the other side and when the customer calls for help they have to wait for you to take your freight back because you can not leave freight on the floor. before you can go help them. then you get yelled at for not having the stock put up fast enough then when you finish stocking on the grocery side then you have to go stock on the other side of the store. Maybe 3-4 people stock the entire General Merchandise side of the store. Not to Mention constantly having to stop putting up freight to help Customers find an item that you have no idea where is but you are not allowed to tell the customer that you don't know you have to just walk around looking for the item which takes more time and we receive no education along the items but we are not allowed to tell the customer this the customers think we have been trained on the products we carry in the store.

Two weeks past and I started a new job. Then about ONE MONTH LATER I received a call from another upper manager asking why I haven't shown up to work.

The actual company itself is horrible and doesn't care at all about it's employees. Retail workers are, after all, very easy to replace. They take more and more from their employees every year and there's no longer any incentive to work there beyond simply having to have a job. Insurance gets worse but more expensive every year. As everyone saw on the news, pay was increased but hours were decreased to make up for that. As everyone knows, there's always EXTREMELY limited staff and that comes directly from HOME OFFICE.

I was just about to get promoted but the at the last second they allowed the previous manager an extra week to come back, when they were gone for 3 months. The work day was stressful as they always wanted more from you even when you were working hard to begin with. The management didn't have a clue to what the associates were doing.

I then moved up to department manager and quickly became Assistant Manager. At the time I worked for them I didn't realize how much I would miss it when I left.,4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Las Vegas, NV",4/23/19,2019,4,23
Poor management,My store manager was rude and only spoke to certain employees. There was a lot of favoritism when it came to hours and who got approved for days requested off. They also don't accept doctor's notes which is insane.,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Greenville, NC",4/23/19,2019,4,23

Working,Its Stressful working for walmart. Management is very Favorited and you can not move up in the company unless you know someone. the pay isnt that great and the hardest part of the job is wondering if you going to be fired because you or a family member is sick and you need to take time off.,2,Former Employee,Sporting Goods Sales Associate ,"North Adams, MA",4/23/19,2019,4,23
Walmart,it wasnt my thing they just break your back then when it breaks they get somebody else to fill your slot. i didnt think they cared about the employees that works for them,2,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Tampa, FL",4/23/19,2019,4,23
Harsh yet hard working,"Initially I did not intend to work at Walmart. However,I am glad they gave me the opportunity. It gave me a chance to get into the work force. I did not work there long. I had quit because I was moving. One of the hardest parts of being in the overnight shift was the returns. There is no way you can get all the returns done on your own. Especially with how you have to run a register AND focus on the returns. The busiest nights by far have been Friday and Saturday nights. And after midnight,everyone goes in late night for alcohol which we are not authorized to sell after midnight. The one part I enjoyed was being able to hold conversations with many people. I met so many nice people when I worked. The workplace normally wants you to be fast paced. Also,you NEVER get any of your breaks or lunch on time during the busy parts of the night. The one thing I do know is management was very understanding. I give them my respect for being very kind and understanding when I handed them my badge and vest because I was moving. I learned a little on the register but I also learned a very important detail. Never do nights for your very first job. I learned my lesson on that. Granted,they work best for my reliable transportation. They do not work best for me. They did a number on my sleep habits for sure. The worst part about the benefits you'd want is that you don't get them for 3-6 months! Some people need benefits within their first month! As for a normal day at work,normally its either at self check out for an hour then to the register by the cigars and cigarettes for most of the night. - more...",2,Former Employee,Overnight Cashier ,"Douglasville, GA",4/23/19,2019,4,23
Sometimes it is fast paced and sometimes it is slow paced,I would not recommend anyone to go work there. They don't treat their associates with respect and they will have you do others jobs rather the job is of higher pay job or not and only pay you for what your job title has to offer.,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Moses Lake, WA",4/23/19,2019,4,23
Productive workplace,Walmart is a fun place to work with a great team.A typical day at work includes unloading packages onto shelves and assisting customers. Management is very helpful. Hardest part of the job is the many distractions while working. The most enjoyable part is always having something to do.,5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Balch Springs, TX 75180",4/23/19,2019,4,23

Ok,Working at Walmart was ok. It was when I was younger and did not have a lot of responsibilities. I was refused regular hours. I worked just short of full time hours although they did not schedule me for full time so they did not have to provide benefits / additional compensation.,2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Customer Service ,"Chandler, AZ",4/23/19,2019,4,23

Fun place to work,"Although it didn't provide much life/work balance it was still a fun place to work because I was a avid shopper. Working here allowed me to see the new trends and understand why the store functioned the way it did. Unfortunately, they were always short handed and therefore the work load wasn't pleasant. I did learn however, the best zoning technique for maximum productivity.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Fredericksburg, VA",4/23/19,2019,4,23
