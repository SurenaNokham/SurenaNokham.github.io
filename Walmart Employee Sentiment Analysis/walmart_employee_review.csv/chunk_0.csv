As a team lead I was never trained on anything, I had to learn everything on my own and I even had to teach some of the coaches how to do certain things that as coaches, they should know what to do.

Very flexible. Great base pay for no prior experience. Great career opportunity,"A typical day at work was clocking in and putting up my stuff, go to my department and get assigned as a dispenser or a shopper or a backroom associate. Usually a dispenser. I would take out order when they came, id scan the orders and take it out to their cars and load up the groceries. You don't have to verbally interact a ton with people if you don't want to, but you most definitely will have to interact with people multiple times a day, unless you're a backroom associate. You get 2 paid fifteen minute breaks and an hour unpaid lunch. Base pay of $15 per hour. BASE. I think thats pretty cool. I would dispense for around two hours, go to break, dispense for two hours, go to lunch, dispense for two hours, go to break, dispense for 2 hours, go home.

They don't know Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves ,"Don't waste your time here like I did. Seven years for nothing. The only thing Walmart cares about is themselves and their money. Do us both a favor and avoid anything to do with this company. It's hot in the warehouse in the summer and cold in the winter. Pitiful raises, tons of work expected but no overtime or compensation.

It's straight,I enjoyed working at Walmart. I was very happy my job and the compensation but I quickly learned that Walmart had some policies that would and did eventually hurt a disabled worker there which really surprised with Walmart being one of the most well known employers of disabled individuals. It was because of these policies and biased behavior from the store manager that I was no longer able to stay with the company.,5,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Raeford, NC",8/7/23,2023,8,7

Never had supervision ,"I was a food and Consumables Associate, at age 16. My bosses were always doing something ""more important"" than telling me what to do or they didn't even work when I did. I almost never had coworkers, or I was training someone new. I don't believe that a 16 year old with 3 months experience should be training new hires.

Poor Management ,The management was the biggest problem. No associates were comfortable enough to speak up to anyone who was higher then them of the because manager.

All of the managers just protect each other with their poor actions and nothing ever changes.

Great hours and pay/ messy team leads ,I work with remodel. From day 1 it has been an unorganized mess. The team leads for remodel don’t communicate with each other clearly and so they’ll tell you to do one thing and turn around and make you undo what you just did which is double work due to their miscommunication. They don’t have the materials they need for remodel which delays finishing but they’ll take it out in the remodel group. They will micromanage you while giving you an ugly face and then call another lead on the phone and talk nasty about you/co workers while you’re struggling to put a shelf up instead of actually helping.,2,Current Employee,Remodel Associate ,"Bartlett, TN",8/4/23,2023,8,4

Bad management. Good work but bad standards about time,I’ve never had a good experience with management. They are almost always unkind and not appreciative of the work the regular associates do. Another issue is the point system. Doctors notes do not matter the Walmart. If you miss work for a health reason you’ll be pointed and rarely can it be removed. Management doesnt care if you had to go to the doctor for any reason. Once your reach 5 points within 6 months you lose your job. Sedgwick takes a long time to get back with you and rarely actually helps you unless you have been there for a certain amount of time. New employees should take caution about what’s going on in their life outside of work. The job of stocking is great but the time limit the managers give you and the attitude they give you make it miserable. ,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Siloam Springs, AR",8/3/23,2023,8,3

I refused at first, but he insisted. As I walked away, I realized that even though my job was simple, it was important. I was able to help someone in need and make a difference in their day.

Gotta Start Somewhere,Was a cart pusher at a Walmart in Arizona for a couple summers. As a college student it got the job done but it's a chaotic work environment where most of the time at least at the location I worked at it wasn't managed all too great. Unfortunately my exit to the company was merely because much of the lack of control I felt while working. As far as the actual work though it was very straight forward and being a cart pusher was nice as I had only one task at hand at all times. Obviously not my dream job but for starting out I say it was not bad. ,3,Former Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Walmart, AZ",7/31/23,2023,7,31

"Chaotic workplace, heavily dependent on current Management","The system of how walmart functions on it’s own is great, but is heavily limited on the management and people guiding it. Do management research before applying to a store in your area since that will largely affect the work quality in that area. The first management I had above me valued customers over speed, and the second valued speed and ethic over customers. I have Autism (primarily high functioning), and the second management after everyone was switched out completely disregarded my disability and kept moving me around areas in an attempt to increase work efficiency.

An Easy Job That Management Makes Unbearable ,"OGP is such a simple job if you have common sense and basic tech skills for the handhelds and if they weren't run on a skeleton crew. Be prepared to do a lot of work with no raises or bonuses for better work while coworkers doing a fraction of the job are paid the same. The management would rather gossip about bad workers and complain that nobody does their job instead of doing THEIR job and punishing those who don't do work. Instead, they'll expect competent workers to pick up the slack and if you start to complain they'll switch from being borderline unprofessionally friendly with you to treating you like you're the scum of the earth . I'd suggest keeping to yourself and doing the bare minimum to keep out of the eyes of your coworkers and management. If you can do that, you'll slide by and keep a job whose wages won't fight the inflation that you'll be changing the price tags for.",2,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Murphysboro, IL",7/30/23,2023,7,30

"Seems enticing at first, the longer you stay the more problems will become apparent","Favoritism is huge here, they have a ridiculous attendance policy where if you reach 5 occurrence points (which can accumulate very easily and quickly, such as being late due to weather, calling out for being sick, family care etc.) They can fire you, however if you are well liked amongst your coworkers and management you will likely be fine to accumulate well above 5 points and sometimes if you're liked enough, a manager will remove points for you. There are employees and managers that are protected due to being well liked despite consistently making horrifically inappropriate comments, while any employee that tries doing the right thing about that or being too ""for the customer"" gets a target on their back and will likely be fired down the road when management is given a chance, for example: the points system. This place is a mess in all sorts of ways, they are quick to accuse and judge the customer, even when the customer has a reasonable request and they like to play as part of a ""team"" and use all sorts of cult-like walmart lingo for normal job activities, such as ""zoning"" instead of ""facing."" NFC payments such as apple pay are not accepted here, and if you insist on paying with your phone they try to get you to download the app and use ""walmart pay"" instead which isn't using NFC technology, it's scanning a QR code.

a decent place to work but management is terrible for the most part ,"I am a shelf stocker at the Lehighton Walmart. Easy job for the most part, however, what ruined the experience for me was management. 2 of the team leads were great, but a different one was constantly accusing me of “disappearing” because i went to use the bathroom. I can name plenty of people who would disappear for an hour, not doing their job. But I got belittled for using the bathroom once during an 8 hour work day.

Backstabery at it’s best… nothing prepares you for Walmart politics,"The only way to advance with Walmart is to play their own unique brand of office politics. You need to figure out how to buy in to all the cheesy culture, while simultaneously showing you know it’s all about the bottom line and people are expendable. Don’t trust anyone, they will stab you in the back if you show any weakness. Don’t take time off, always stay late and come in early, be the first one to jump on a register and the first to stock shelves. If you have a new baby or a death in the family, DON’T take time off (puts a target on your back). Be prepared to be told “you suck” every day. They manage by exception and corporate management will NEVER tell you you are doing a good job, no matter how you are doing, you feel like the next word out of their mouth will be “you’re fired.” It won’t be, but it will feel like it. Don’t take it personally, their boss treats them the same way all the way up to the top.",1,Former Employee,ASSISTANT MANAGER ,"Dilworth, MN",7/26/23,2023,7,26

"Perfectly fine to get by with, but they only promote the worst employees for positions","Cashier work is alright, but it gets grading fast, especially since if you are a good cashier you will never be allowed to move up or to other positions.

There are such a wide variety of customers, but most are the most miserable abusive people you'll ever deal with.Lawn and garden is a decent spot between cashier work, outdoor/indoor associate work, and light knowledge on landscaping.

I have also taken issue with having to work all holidays and weekends. I am very aware that this is a “requirement” to work at Walmart, but it means I cannot celebrate these holidays and spend time with my family. I have never been happy here; customers like to be checked out by energized and enthused cashiers, but I have not been able to provide that. And some days, I am the only cashier available and that alone is infuriating. When I started, I was excited to have this job and to work for Walmart; now, I no longer am.

Ok short term,"Management doesn’t have your back, they claim there is no retaliation for using your PPTO but that’s not the case. Managers can and will retaliate for using your time whether an emergency arose or you had it planned with them well in advance you’d be gone. They tend to hold back their best workers and give false hope of advancement to placate you for awhile while keeping you in your role to help make them look good to their own managers. Meanwhile the poor workers are constantly transferred to other departments of their choosing because management doesn’t want their poor work to reflect on them. People with disabilities are rarely provided assistance for them. ",1,Former Employee,Loader ,"Hopkinsville, KY",7/25/23,2023,7,25

The corporate ppl don’t know how hard is to run a store in certain areas of the country like the northeast.,"The company and corporate don’t care if salary managers take vacation or not they just care the business run smooth and they make it difficult every time as they keep cutting hours to the hardest store run by good and great leaders who tried to do their job but some don’t even take days off and Walmart all it does is intimidate their managers by making it difficult for them to run stores. The company is not the same when Sam Walton was alive.  The company has not humanity anymore yes the pay is good but when you put all the hours in this company you really don’t see the pay as when you a salary manager you working everyday without days off or vacation you making probably $5 an hour!  This company is the worst to work for and that no one sees.  All the corporate people should go work for 1 month as managers in these stores Bayonne NJ, Secaucus NJ, North Bergen NJ, etc…. And see how hard is to run these store with so much volume, the shoppers this stores get and the wages they give!  All they want to see is metrics but metrics don’t work if you don’t have the associates help to do so and if you do t have wages you have no associates and they get overworked too.

It could be better ,"You would think retail wouldn’t be that stressful but it really is. There are unrealistic expectations in some areas of the store while other areas have almost none.  Walmart continues to find ways to take away from their associates. They gave quarterly bonuses then took those away, they offered degrees in healthcare, then took those away. They paid more in different areas of the store now they dropped the pay and it’s $16.00 across the board for associates and $21.00 for team leads.

Unfortunately the customers here were pretty hostile and rude compared to other places I've worked at. Some great coworkers, but some bad managers. The CSS was always chronically angry and unfriendly and regularly gave the workplace a negative vibe. But it seems most Walmarts always have that one manager. There are clear favorites, as the newbies would be left alone on check stands during rush while the favorites would be chatting up front.

The work was easy and pays okay but management at my store ruined this job,"Cap 1, Online grocery, and Third shift pay the most starting out at my store. The health benefits they offer come out of your paycheck after three months of work. You also get a measly 10% discount card after three months that can ONLY be used on general merchandise not groceries or food items. You get normal vacation PTO that has to be approved and protected PTO which you can use whenever you feel like it or in emergencies  Most of the job is fair work but be prepared to be moved to what ever department or job is needed at that time regardless of what you agreed to or signed up for. Management at my store was atrocious and inhuman at times and by far the worst part about the job. They do not care about you, you are merely a work horse no matter how far up you go in the store. You might even be talked down to at times no matter how you perform. This is an okay job to have to get to the next one and can do you justice for a short time.

Good salary and some decent people but safety was an issue,"The pay was decent for having to run multiple departments but safety was an issue. Pallets were always over 6 ft high or taller when it clearly has ""60"" on most of the pallets and they are ALWAYS double stacked, a huge safety issue because somebody could get crushed by one of the pallets falling over.

Where do I start,Walmart was fun to work at at first and then it slowly started getting worse. While I was pregnant I put in a request to change my hours from 9am-6pm to 1pm-10pm so it would be easier for people to pick me up and drop me off. I also asked for a weekend day off and none of that never happened which sucks since it’s hard for my to find a sitter for my 4 month old on weekends. And I’m still autistic so it’s hard for me to multitask especially when it’s in a fast paced environment like online grocery. They wanted me to go fast and pick the right items which is hard for me because I don’t like talking to strangers so it’s hard for me to ask people to move out of my way. So now if I don’t improve my first time pick rate and my speed by this Friday I might be getting fired👍🏻 Totally recommend if you want your mental health to down spiral,2,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Brooklyn, CT",7/24/23,2023,7,24

The experience is divided,"Some of the management still sticks to the core company values. They provide you with the tools you need to succeed and mentor you in a way that allows you to go above and beyond. Other management couldn't care. They cut corners and short people to get numbers that look good for their store. They offer little to no support and will throw you under the bus to make themselves look good. This will differ from store to store, but there will usually be a bit of both in each. The company as a whole has good intentions.

Bad Management,Management never does their job and sleeps at the workplace. People have left due to being burned out as stockers. I am overnight and it seems everyone is doing more work then they are supposed to. We are tasked with doing the managers job that they refuse to do. Its a mess and thats why everyone leaves this job. The money is good but the physical labor grades on you. As a full-time worker I never was given any vacation time in their system and that was actually illegal. Becareful if you work for this company they don't value you at all. If you work here please have a better job lined up within 6 months to a year. The labor will drive you up a wall.,2,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Dallas, GA",7/24/23,2023,7,24

Good place to work to get experience with people,"The management team depending on what team you're apart of doesn't care about mental illness. I've experienced that working there, with depression. If you're too stressed they don't care, and still expect too much for you to get done. The associates are fine working with as long as you're in a team, sometimes the management will put you in a department that requires two or more people to get the job done, it's ridiculous. The times to get a department don't make sense either, if you have 19 hours of freight and your by yourself you can't finish it in the eight hours your there. They have too much of high expectations, and treat people like dirt or expect them to work like robots. If you want to get a job that puts your foot in the door for working with people or in stocking, it's a decent job with too much expectations.

Company expects work done on bare minimum staffing and the associates that do show up (so many call ins) suffer as a result. Wages are not equal to cost of living in most areas.

Have alot of back issues since working there.,4,Former Employee,Walmart recieving and stocker ,"Logansport, IN",7/22/23,2023,7,22
It’s alright ,"Good pay, work full time and you get tones of hours, they’ll work with your schedule. However super strict on their attendance policy you will get fired if you go over.",4,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"San Marcos, TX",7/22/23,2023,7,22

I would NEVER go back and or recommend anyone to the store (2523) I was at perhaps a another but the job itself was great,"What is the best part of working at the company?The job itself I loved. I did Online Grocery as well as stocking and enjoyed doing it. The coaches and team leads are what really made it unbearable. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?All the Coaches and Leads and even the store manager you could tell didn’t want to be there and it showed through how they acted, treated and responded to people and situations. They would make you half do your job so it could be quicker but then get mad when our departments are a mess. Also they never have enough printers, TCs or batteries so you can’t even do your job sometimes What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic. If you aren’t a cool kid and entertain and validate the coaches and leads good luck. It’s a popularity contest for sure. What is a typical day like for you at the company?IF your team lead and coach show up, generally pretty smooth. Without one or the other it gets really hectic. Hope you have everything you need  like a printer or TC otherwise you will have to go look for a coach which is not as easy as you think it would be.",1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Brea, CA",7/22/23,2023,7,22

Stocking the floors and the Managements ,not very good and great with communication skills and meagerly lack of team work along with showing row models to everyone to show them the rights and wrongs of doing things and management and team leads takes things out on you or who ever for now reasons for someone else's faults or wrongs and much more things too as well etc.,2,Former Employee,3rd shift stocker ,"New London, WI",7/22/23,2023,7,22
Warehouse as a whole,The human resource manager is horrible. The managers show favoritism. The company doesn't care about you when it comes to your personal life or health issues (if any arise). All of the jobs are fairly easy with great pay. The only job that is demanding really is order filling. The pay for it is great though however you will pay for it in the long run with back issues.  ,2,Former Employee,Multiple Positions ,"Monroe, GA",7/22/23,2023,7,22
You're just a number to management.,"You get assinged a number when youre hired, and they use that to identify you. They dont seem to care about employees as much as they say they do.

Okay place to work,"Reliable if looking for short term work. Compensation is reasonable, it’s more than some other retail chains. The attendance policy is enforced for some.

Only thanksgiving and Christmas days off, the rest of the year it is open.",4,Former Employee,Online Grocery Associate ,South Carolina,7/22/23,2023,7,22

Horrible scheduling and bad managemnet,"Managers never check schedules will constantly tell you to do something, but if a higher up asks why they will lie and say they never told you that. Only time they follow policy is when corporate is making a visit. They hire people that don't want to work and won't make them work and will through that work load onto the ones that do work. The schedule is usually messed up sometimes even to the point no help to do the tasks that are given within a certain time frame.",2,Current Employee,Tire and Lube Technician ,"Rocky Mount, VA",7/22/23,2023,7,22
Super hard work tons of heavy lifting,I had to pick up grills and help move them every day.

"Great people, not a great schedule all the time","I'm a OGP team lead and although everyone else it took years to get to that point, I did it in under 6 months from hire date. My employees work for me, I jump in and help them with whatever they or the store needs & am constantly multi tasking. Picking, staging, phone calls, meetings, nil pick reports & errors, returns, claims, dispensing, prepping, SFS(ship from store) On a rotation I get 4-5 closing shifts which is my one negative. My coach is very tough & the job is very fast paced because there is always something to do or another department that could use help during slow evenings.",4,Current Employee,Team Lead OGP ,"Pittsburgh, PA",7/22/23,2023,7,22
Overall pretty decent!,"The people you work with make the biggest difference, so approaching the job with the right mindset is essential to making it feel like a decent place to work. At my location, the managers are actually pretty cool and take their job responsibilities seriously. However, in my position, there are times when I get stressed, which is bound to happen in retail, especially dealing with difficult customers. Additionally, we often need to cover other shifts, which can be challenging but also adds a sense of novelty and prevents burnout. The benefits provided are a significant factor that keeps you going strong and I suppose the biggest thing I learned here is a few life skills which are essential for communicating with your team in order to get the work required from you done. Hardest part is time management of what needs to get done vs prioritizing the customers needs and the lack consistency of store to store in what's expected from you can be a hassle to deal with rather than going by the book (which really depends for those who you work with being essential).",4,Current Employee,Entertainment TA ,"St. Croix Falls, WI",7/22/23,2023,7,22
Horrible ,Idk you get paid and that’s about it. You’ll never have a set or consistent schedule. You’re lucky if you get a good lead. Customers always suck. They like to pick favorites. ,1,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Mountain Home, ID",7/22/23,2023,7,22

By far the WORST place to work hands down!!!,"Do yourself a favor and accept a job ANYWHERE else. They use phrases like ""family oriented"" and ""work-life"" balance freely to lure you in. You will be promised a lot and led to believe you will advance and be promoted but only the managers pets and favorites will get any consideration. You end up doing all the work but management gets ALL the credit. Unless you are a member of the management team you pretty much don't matter at all. Look at all the perks this corporation has taken from its hourly employees but management gets huge bonuses and other perks. I wasted 25 years of my life working and sacrificing and once I got severely injured and filed workers comp I had a target on my back. I never will regret leaving this mess of a company, they care about nothing accept managers and their bottom line. The only reason I stayed so long was because my town had limited options for employment but I am here to tell you to relocate if Walmart is your only choice.

Bad Job,"Working at Walmart was an absolute nightmare. From day one, it was clear that this company cared very little about its employees and was more concerned with cutting costs and maximizing profits. I felt like just another cog in the machine, constantly pushed to do more with less support and resources.First and foremost, the pay was abysmal. I struggled to make ends meet with the meager wages they offered, even though I worked long hours and did my best to provide excellent customer service. It's disheartening to see the company's executives earning exorbitant salaries while the rest of us struggled to make a living.The working conditions were equally appalling. The store was often understaffed, leaving employees overwhelmed with tasks and unable to provide adequate assistance to customers.

Toxic management  and poor training,"I worked at Walmart as an overnight stocker. The management is very unprofessional and Toxic. The on site training is almost non existent, you are put with someone to shadow with, and it's a hit or miss whether you will learn what you need to know or not. You are expected to know how to do things and know terms that you are not taught. The expectations are strange and almost unrealistic, sometimes I even thought they were making my job harder by limiting me like not allowing me to use the right tools to get the job done or taking away help and giving me an unrealistic time limit. My personal experience with the work environment is not very good, a lot of people will spread rumors about each other and it's hard not to get roped into it. Only pros I can think of is the pay, insurance, and payed time off. Other than that I would recommend giving it a shot for a little bit.

Decent pay for the work,"I enjoyed most of my time with Walmart. I joined the ODP (previously OGP) department in its infancy and saw it develop into great popularity at this location. The work volume fluctuates frequently, with some hours slowed to the point of insanity, while others are so busy you are working non stop. Unfortunately when things are slow you often get put on boring tasks throughout the store, which is exacerbated by chronic overstaffing. Management was always kind and helpful, as well as the other staff. Also keep in mind that you will likely have to work outdoors in extreme heat or cold, rain or snow and while there was clothing provided for these situations, it could still be very unpleasant. In addition, training can be lacking when dealing with customers, as they will ask complex questions about their orders which you wont be able to answer.",4,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Hartford, WI",7/20/23,2023,7,20

Walmart is a mess!!,"You are hired to do a job in specific department(s). They pay online shoppers and stockers (cap 1, 2 and 3) more per hour than regular floor associates... BUT you usually spend 1/4 to 1/2 your day doing the stocker and shopper jobs and you don't get compensated for doing their job... which is very unethical -- hire the people needed in those position or pay everyone the same amount!!! Then some team leads/coaches whine because your assigned task/job didn't get done in a timely manner. Starting pay is slightly better ($14) than minimum wage ($12) for a floor associate, with about a 1.5% increase per year. The increases don't seem to be based on productivity or anything because all the associates (that I know of) get the same increase. When the base pay increased from $11 (I think is what it was in 2020) and hour to $14; I ended up making the same per hour as employees who'd been there for almost 10 years because they didn't just add the $3 to their pay. If they were making $13 an hour they went to $14; if they already made $14 or more an hour they didn't get anything.You get an employee discount after 3 months on the job for most things but it usually just covers taxes; but that's a Company wide decision not the specific store.The Walmart I work for is very willing to work with odd available work schedules and my manager is great.",2,Current Employee,Associate ,"Blue Springs, MO",7/20/23,2023,7,20

For good workers generally there is opportunity for advancement in this company. The pay is usually pretty competitive depending on the area you work and where you live.

One was a bit of a micromanager and not even our department Lead but tolerable. Over time more and more responsibilities were added with no additional compensation. A ""promotion"" was just more work for the same pay. The rushes were fun and made time fly. Unfortunately, customers could be very rude and entitled and there wouldn't be back up from management especially at night before closing. They had to be tracked down physically to ask for help with anything.

"Good Company, Bad Leaders","Walmart gets a lot of bad rep for it's employee culture. Truthfully, the company itself isn't terrible. All the resources you need are there, lots of room for improvement on personal and professional skills, and Walmart DEFINITELY has room for growth within the company, all in exchange for your patience. The downside to Walmart is that the management and leaders within the company are some of the most poor performers in the service and retail industry. To give them credit, the managers that care work a ton. 50-60 work weeks in a retail store is no joke when you're dealing with managing 10+ associates a day, scheduling issues, a constant stream of HR complaints by associates, plus dealing with hundreds of rude customers on top of it all.Speaking as a former manager for Walmart, I'd say that the one thing the company needs to focus on is actually giving decent salaries to the store level associates, and not to those ""Market"" ""District"" and ""Divisional"" managers that get insane bonuses and salaries for doing nothing other than regurgitating metrics down the ladders throat, and stomp down on those down the chain for ""poor performance."" Without a doubt in my mind, after meeting many of these upper levels of leadership, I can comfortably say that all they do in a work day is make phone calls, answer and send out emails, emphasize ""trainings"" that nobody needs, and never really be down to earth with what's going on at the store level.There is an obvious disconnect from leadership beyond the store level.

Honest Pay and Benefits for honest work. Staffing struggles cripple experience.,"Work isn't too hard, pay is fair for the work involved. Staying long enough to trigger benefits including discount card can really boost net income.That said, if the store is suffering from low staff, there is always much to do in the store. Managers won't shy from squeezing normally hard-working employees leading to burnouts. Individual/department success is not rewarded. At least in my experience, high success lead to less staffing despite higher profits and costumer satisfaction. Often pulling employees to cover other departments.

Like being back in high school ,Very disappointing experience. Unrealistic job expectations. No human compassion. No recognition for positive performance. Excessive scrutiny and criticism for minor job infractions. Very clickish. Was like being back in high school. Hard work didn’t matter it is all who you know. Many people even with longevity treated poorly but feel trapped. No help for things going on badly. They will relate a process for effect to resolve things but all meet with dead end roads. Everyone there seems miserable but people feel like they have no one to turn to to change the unethical behavior. Management looks away or participates in bad behavior workers just have to tolerate it or be without work. No one knows what to do. I was told it was much different and better years ago but has declined significantly. After my experience I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. I did not expect what I experienced at all. ,1,Former Employee,Digital Shopper ,"Evans Mills, NY",7/16/23,2023,7,16
its a job if your willing to sacrifice everything to make it to the top,Walmart is a great company but at the end of the day you don't see the ins and outs of the company. The company cares more about money then people you are a number. You will be looked down upon if you have a family and expect to spend time with them especially if you are in management. You will be looked over for positions if you can answer the dumb interview questions about tell me about a time when. so it does not matter if you are an amazing worker or not it will not get you anywhere.

"Might be better in a larger area, but I doubt it. ","Our store is in a small town, making it one of the largest employers in the area, and yet we are constantly understaffed. They expect all associates to do the job of two or three people while not even being paid a living wage for one position. Due to the lack of staff, nothing gets done properly, and then some big wigs will plan a visit and it’s ALL HANDS ON DECK to fix everything in the store in 2 days so that they think that’s how the store always is. And if that means you work “over time” they’ll make you take longer lunches to bring your total hours back under the over time limit for the week. Management is extremely abusive. There are only a small handful of quality team leads and coaches, everyone else is just on a power trip. Forget advancement. You gotta be related to, or best friends with, someone already in management to even be considered, regardless of qualifications.The majority of employees don’t even last 3 months, and anyone who does has had their soul crushed. Requests for time off are constantly denied, even if requested weeks/months in advance. Stating “No coverage” or “No Available Hours”.

Stressful and tense workplace. Expectations exceed job positions,"While working at Walmart I was expected to go out of my way and become a manager without any of the benefits. I was given the stresses of lower management from our store managers. I was expected to lead my team while not being compensated for my efforts. This greatly influenced how I feel about the company. I was expected to pick up positions where they couldn't hire anybody. The motto is do more for less and walmart makes sure to milk any of their workers to the last drop. Walmart also trains the management to have little to no empathy, I suffered a loss in my family while working there and they scolded me for needing to take time off to grieve.

It was unpredictable which was kind of the exciting part of every night shift. They always put me in different aisles where they need people for the shift. My least favorite are definitely produce and dairy section because I always lifted a lot of heavy boxes and racks of products which cause my back pain. It was like my back was about to be permanently injured since my physical strength isn't the strongest at all. Other than that the frozen and grocery section were my favorite. This was the easiest job I had where I just have to stock all the products throughout the night and to not be slow.*What you learned?- I learned the hard work of working in a grocery store. I learned a lot of terms and just basically how it difficult it was. I will not take the groceries for granted. I also learn  to never underestimate everything, to not get too ahead of myself, and the importance of teamwork and communication. The importance of my body and well-being. That I have limitations.*Management?-Well, it was bad and good. Good because of how cool and chill the team leads were to me. They were straight forward and honest. I like all of them.

"Management delegates tasks to underpaid employees. Shortcuts taken everywhere, but SOPs and training are thorough",Expect to be thrown into your job with little training. CBLs or Computer Based Learning is how every single employee is trained for every single position and necessary SOPs. Cashiers have it rough.

Mostly because all Salaried tasks were delegated to Hourly Supervisors - I was the only one for awhile. Employee attitude varies but most employees make the most of the job.

Horrible work place that loves to bring their employees down,"As soon as you walk in for work they expect you to be clocked in right away, even if you are 10-15 minuets early.  I have learned that management always have each others backs and throw their employees under the bus if productivity is low, and that HR will do little to nothing for the employees and label you as the problem in the work place if you complain about management. The workplace was fine by all account and the people I've worked with were the best. The hardest part of the job was never knowing what you had to do next, and when you as management or a supervisor they would ignore you or give you a vague answer on what you should be doing, or they would tell you ""you should already know what you should be doing"".

Walmart is a bustling store with a constant flow of inventory, and it keeps me on my toes. From unloading trucks to sorting and categorizing merchandise, every day presents new challenges and opportunities to showcase my organizational skills.One of the most rewarding aspects of being a handler is the sense of accomplishment that comes from seeing the store well-stocked and prepared for customers. It's satisfying to know that my efforts directly contribute to the overall efficiency of the store and help create a positive shopping experience for customers.Teamwork plays a crucial role in the success of a Walmart store, and I appreciate the supportive and collaborative work environment. My colleagues are always willing to lend a hand or share their knowledge, making it easier to adapt and excel in my role. The camaraderie among the team fosters a sense of belonging and motivates me to perform my best.While the job can be physically demanding at times, it has also helped me build my stamina and endurance. Handling heavy items and being on my feet for extended periods have improved my physical fitness.

My favorite job so far,"I (21F) am currently orderfilling for the DC in Mankato, MN and I can easily say this has been my favorite place to work out of the 5 jobs I've had. The benefits especially for those in their 20s and 30s are spectacular and our management here actually cares about their team and shows that every day you come in. The coworkers have high morale and they're wonderful to talk to. The only reason I give 4 stars overall is because the two paid breaks feel very short for a 10 hour day. I work the 1st shift which was a massive adjustment from previously working evenings in fast food for nearly 6 years as well. It's a physical career which is something I personally really enjoy about it; that's not for everyone though, just like working in an environment as cold as -20°F isn't for everyone. If you come to your DC with a good attitude and work hard while you're there, typically you end up loving where you're at. This particular DC has tons of opportunities to cross-train in different areas like loading, wrap, and receiving as well which is something I'd recommend doing if you plan to work in a position like orderfilling for a while (it WILL eventually wear down on your body no matter which area you orderfill in). Safety is a huge priority here, too, which is something I rarely saw taken seriously at my other jobs.",4,Current Employee,DD Orderfiller ,"Mankato, MN",7/7/23,2023,7,7

"Horrible Experience, Worked there for nearly 15 years","Working as an associate at walmart is not that bad,  you will be a number on a sheet and no one will care about whether you live or die, but the pay is okay and if you can get hours its not that bad.   Working in management, which I did for most of my time working for this company, is horrible!  You will be asked to do immoral things from upper management and regional management.  You will be told that you ""must"" fire older workers, to be replaced with younger and cheaper labor.  This is a souless corporation who will never have the interest of the worker in mind.  If you are a salaried manager, they expect you to be on call 24/7 with no excuses.

Understaffed and poor food safety ,"If your a good employee expect to pick up the slack from others. The person who runs the department (coach) doesn’t want more than two people to be behind the deli (cutting the meat/cheeses, taking out rotisseries, frying food, making sandwiches, doing online orders.) This is very difficult for only two people to do. You will probably get scheduled with one other person and will be expected to close the deli at 8pm and have everything cleaned my 10pm. Unable to have any sort of water or soda and lunch boxes due to “contamination”. Other staff have a hard time pulling food when it expires in the hot case. They have an ineffective system for attendance. If your sick you can’t be around food, so you call in to avoid spreading it, but you only have 5 points (attendance system) so be careful you could get fired for trying to prevent getting people sick. Make sure to take a leave of absence if you think you’ll go past 5 points. You won’t get much help with the filing the loa as well. If you’re gonna work at Walmart Deli only do so if actually staffed because you will work your tail feather off trying to keep up. Also there’s no specific trainer so expect to learn things from others and yourself. Good luck.",1,Current Employee,Deli/Bakery Associate ,"Shawano, WI",7/7/23,2023,7,7

Most managers do not consider things that they should or shouldn't be saying.

The PTO and PPTO is nice but if the system makes an error and you get a point when you use your PPTO, they don’t fix it!! Also apparently if you use too much protected pto, you can get in trouble. And it’s supposed to be protected so you don’t get points. The managers play favorites and if you’re not one of the favorites you are working like a dog your whole shift while other people get to walk around doing nothing the whole shift.

They overwork even the most productive workers/overachievers.,Managers overworked even the most productive workers/overachievers to make up for the work they themselves failed to do ahead of time. And workers were often expected to get a job that takes 2-3 people by themselves within 15 minutes. 2 supervisors quit because of poor treatment from management and another coworker quit because they were the only one stocking up the freezer in their area and the boxes just kept piling up because one person can't keep up with it all. They also push back your lunch break by hours because they prioritize production. Another coworker skips their lunch break entirely in order to get home on time everyday because they make you stay til everything's done but also refuses to pay overtime.

Workplace ,Walmart is good to work for. It's just climbing up the ladder is kind of a waste of time. To many employees walking around with phones and ear buds in ears.

A Routine Yet Mixed Experience,"Working in Walmart's Electronics Department was an experience that offered both positives and negatives. While the job itself was fairly routine and the breaks were enjoyable, the management aspect left much to be desired.Let's start with the routine nature of the work. The daily tasks in the Electronics Department were fairly predictable, which provided a sense of stability. Stocking shelves, assisting customers with their inquiries, and ensuring the products were well-organized were the primary responsibilities. If you appreciate a structured work environment where you can develop a routine, this department could be a good fit for you.One of the highlights of working in this department was the breaks. Walmart generally provides adequate break times, which allowed employees to rest, recharge, and grab a quick snack. These breaks were essential, especially during busy periods, as they offered a chance to momentarily step away from the constant hustle and bustle of the department.However, the management at Walmart's Electronics Department left much to be desired. Communication between management and employees often felt lacking. Important updates and changes were not consistently relayed, which resulted in confusion and missed opportunities for growth. Additionally, the support and guidance from management were not always readily available, leading to a sense of frustration among employees.Moreover, the lack of a clear career path or advancement opportunities within the department was disappointing.

If you don’t already have a national certification, you do on-the-clock training modules and they’ll pay for your exam.A 15 minute break is always allowed as long as you take it at a good time and not during a rush hour.This is the most efficient pharmacy I’ve worked in, because they use handhelds so you can move around more as you work and do many things at the tip of your fingertips.There’s a bathroom built in to the pharmacy which is definitely a plus so you don’t have to take extra time going to the back or front of the store.My entire team was very welcoming.

Yeah they’ve upped their rate of pay over the years, ESPECIALLY to entice people to want to work for them during the Pandemic but you better believe their accountants are crunching numbers left and right to make up for that pay increase.  Whether it be laying half their warehouse workforce off, or not paying you holiday pay to work on Thanksgiving, or giving you an even crappier health insurance package than the previous year What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Working Asset Protection, basically having to be the police but getting zero respect from anyone INCLUDING Management.  Bringing safety and compliance issues to the attention of management just for it to be ignored.  Basically having to do EVERYTHING to keep the warehouse OSHA compliant but only getting paid as much are a regular floor associate What is the work environment and culture like at the company?A cult for the people that do enough sucking up and butt kissing.

Horrible Work Place,"Managers and corporate do not care for their employees. They do everything possible to not have to help employees in many situations. Overwork employees. Accuse employees of stealing time and then steal money and time from employees that have been earned by having them ""fix"" their time sheets. They expect their employees to be team players, have them work other departments and then penalize them when their numbers don't look good in their original department due to the employees being pulled in many different directions. Many times employees have had to go without their 15 min breaks AND their lunch due to being short staffed. If an employee happened to make overtime, their higher-ups would have them take longer breaks to not have to pay the overtime to their employees. Managers were very unprofessional and often times, did not help neither their employees or their customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out to go home.

Occasionally fun however….,"Whenever I first started at this Walmart, I was excited to come in everyday but unfortunately I started to hate coming in at all. If you worked front end like I did you would be thrown on candy with some unfair time limits because your coach will have a temper tantrum because it’s still there (Candy is one of, if not the longest department to run plus aisle easily gets overcrowded which makes it longer to work.)The coach treats you disrespectfully and doesn’t like giving days off. The team leads will seem nice at first but as time passes you’ll figure how much you can actually trust them which is…..0. A lot of people have left this job because this coach and team leads and I don’t blame them. The true people that you can trust are the coworkers who you’ll become best friends with. They will be the light of your day when the days are rough. The coach expects you to treat customers great to get good reviews but wants to treat you poorly which discourages you.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Lexington, NC",7/1/23,2023,7,1

The good managers, if they even move up the ladder at all, are often fired or pushed into quitting for promoting worker health over sheer profits.

They DO NOT care about your well being at all. I traveled a hour to work there, crossing a bridge included. I asked could I go home early due to the terrible weather and I was told “ I don’t really like leaving your other employee by herself.” The next night I was working alone by MYSELF. Definitely felt like some employees mattered more than others. I also heard my team lead gossiping about how I wasn’t moving fast enough when I was the only one willing to work that department.

Awsome co-workers- BAD managers,I loved working with my coworkers the benefits were great and the pay was decent at the time though they could have paid more and after I left they did increase their pay really well. The management of this particular store was awful and the worst I have ever dealt with. My direct manager played favoritism and was hardly ever working and when he did work he left early. I was stuck up front all day during covid with the plastic barriers that you had to yell through and I would go home with a sore throat because the manager's favorites never had to switch out with the people that he didn't like. The other pharmacist in the pharmacy were amazing I loved every floater that came in. But if you could get rid of the manager in the lead it would have been way better. The store manager also heard I was having an issue with his manager and did nothing about it. When I handed in my two weeks notice HR pretended like they wanted to help me right then and there but I said no you guys didn't help me 6 months ago so why would I want to stay. HR then proceeded to say sorry and if there's anything that they could do. I left got a new job much happier.,4,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,1606 s signal butte rd mesa az ,6/30/23,2023,6,30

Just No,"This is probably the worst place that I've ever worked. Walmart has a way of taking the good in people, and beating it out of them. After learning my job, the only other thing I learned was that I never worked hard enough, and I never stretched myself thin enough. They will have you rushing, and working a job that should take two people to do. I OFTEN had to meet debtlines by skipping when to normally take a break/lunch, and I would work 7.5hrs to meet these debtlines, then take my 1hr lunch, and two 15min breaks, and leave for the day. If I were to take my breaks at their normal times, management would be breathing down my neck, because I wasn't finished with my debtlines. I was offered a dept manager position multiple times, but always turned it down, because in the span of the 3yrs I worked at walmart, I must've had 7 different dept managers. Some of which, I admired, had great work ethics, respected customers and employees, tried their best to meet quotas, and could not see why they were fired/demoted. Do NOT work at walmart.

(They wanted to make Sundays mandatory even for those who view Sundays in a highly religious regard.)

Consistent hours bad management,"I loved the consistency when it came to my schedule and the departments I was in. Management didn’t train me properly because she was leaving her position. Higher up management was toxic, they spend the majority of time in HR talking and not showing a level of professionalism that they should (unless higher management than them showed up). My significant other works at another Walmart and I’ve heard how it’s significantly better, I guess I had bad luck picking the Walmart that I did. We were understaffed and I was told to work harder even when we knowingly were in need of several more people at the store.

Refusal to give me hours and incompetent management,"It was great at first with actual credit was given to hard workers but slowly got worse with management changes. From giving us unrealistic times for jobs and having us to break our backs to accomplish said task to making stupid decisions that cost us a lot of money, I didn't have plans to leave anytime soon because realistically it had pretty good pay and benefits. However, I had actually left because they refused to schedule me when my schedule was wiped. When I tried to come in because of course I need to pay bills they threatened a coaching and points added to my record. The last straw was when they directly wiped my hours from my schedule again.

Wanna go to the bathroom but someone already went? Productivity discussion is your result. OGP understaffed? Raise order count is the Walmart way.

More emphasis and urgency was placed on getting new product out on the floor opposed to proper food safety procedures like product rotation, storage of overstock, sanitizing, cleaning and maintenance.

Well I know to not work at Walmart again. ,"The management team is pretty sweet and understanding. So were some of my coworkers. Although the team leads are demanding and careless. When you work at Walmart as a digital shopper you start to realize that Walmart employees such as the team leads and trainers give off a very careless vibe. They care when it comes to getting the products quickly but not about the person that has to get the products or the rest of the customers in the store. They expect you to find the products even if the store is not organized properly. They don't care about your health, they give points if late, don't show up, and other things. I couldn't come to work several times because I just started and It took a big toll on my body. I couldn't walk at home so I know I wouldn't be able to help at that big store. The food in the hot and ready station is always undercooked, mostly chicken. I got sick several times. All in all, I wouldn't want to work or shop there. There's sanitary issues that need to be solved within the food/raw meat areas. As a digital shopper, you are most likely to do more jobs than what you are supposed to. Such as going all the way to the back to find what you're looking for when there are employees that are supposed to keep the shelves stacked. All these things you are doing are timed by the way. If you have a healthy body full of stamina and a nonchalant attitude when it comes to being picked on then you will fit in perfectly. Also let me not forget how cheap they are when it comes to benefits.

I used to be a big team player now I just don't care anymore.,What is the best part of working at the company?Most of the people you work with are niceWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?You're treated as though you have to do the job of eight people.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The managers mostly don't care about you. They never appreciate anything you accomplish.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Boring and uneventful I have said I don't want to be in my department and they told me I have to wait for a replacement. Two months later still no replacement.,1,Former Employee,Toys Sales Associate ,"Sherwood, OR",6/26/23,2023,6,26
Not a bad job,"I never held Walmart in high esteem as a place to work, but they've stepped up with years of pressure from shoppers and criticism. Pay has increased. They offer some benefits that smaller companies can't or won't, like 401(k) and they'll match up to 6%. They'll work with your schedule.  Training is ongoing.  You're going to work with some idiots, but the point system weeds them out. ",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pomona, CA",6/26/23,2023,6,26
The management is terrible. ,Terrible place to work if you’re actually a hard worker and looking to move up. They make the good workers carry the lazy ones (including management) for the same base pay. ,1,Former Employee,Retail Associate/stocker ,"Salinas, CA store #5751",6/26/23,2023,6,26
fast paced,"keep on trucking, consistent schedule, hours vary, most days are a struggle but the pay is the best around. always moving their managers around and having to hire new ones. unrealistic expectations, lack of forethought, but the 2 paid breaks and 30 min lunch and high pay..... it definitely has a couterbalancing set of ups and downs.",3,Current Employee,Recieving Associate ,"Harrisonville, MO",6/26/23,2023,6,26
Lazy and draining,"I do my best but at this point, its just a check. The employees including management do not want to make the work environment better.

Terrible work place,"My work from home system they sent home with me kept have malfunctions so I couldn’t work for over 4 months, then I had a baby with a lot of health issues and they made it impossible to file time off or anything to do with FMLA. They’re a big company that won’t give two cr*ps about what happens to you or your family. Wouldn’t work with me on my health issues or my pumping schedule. Just terrible terrible terrible do not recommend working for them at all. One team lead will tell you one thing and then five minutes later another would tell you something else. Training for your position is also terrible don’t expect to learn what your supposed to do effectively as it’s just a big guessing game to the people training you as well. Good luck.

Keep an open mind. ,What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits are great. They work with your schedule. They’re great about accepting days off request as long as they’re turned in well ahead of schedule being made. The pay is good and when we get to have those regular customers that make you feel like you’re an important asset to the company….yea they’re the ones we miss the most. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?It’s only stressful if you don’t do your job the right way from the start. Walmart is a day to day repetitive job which makes it very easy. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The culture is a mixture of everyone who’s anyone and the work environment is fast paced but depending on leadership beginning with your store manager and ending with your hourly associates sometimes they are the ones who can discourage you. Management has a tendency of making associates feel uncomfortable but then there are those who make you feel welcome. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy from the moment you walk in but depending on the type of associate you are it can be from the moment you step out of your vehicle.,5,Former Employee,Front End Team Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",6/25/23,2023,6,25

Money isn't everything ,"It took over 6 weeks to even begin on boarding and they don't  tell you anything during that time. Benefits are the same as everywhere else, pay is a bit higher though. They have no on call because  you are tied to your stores. You must always answer your phone, or risk being written up( notorious for 1-3am emergencies). Ancient equipment with mold and toxic spores(free training to identify), policy isn't inforced for monthly cleanings, Ordering system crashes weekly due to poor layer UI, store managers(coaches/leads)want mothing to do with you since you're asking them to pull product. They promised raises and resended it after check budgets. Positive light is start whenever want and finish after 4-6 calls a day (minus a PE daily), pay is decently priced at 31 tech 2 and 40 for tech 3, but they will have their pounds of flesh for it.My hope is like the last time they went inhouse, it burns out.

It is a very stressful place with managers who make you feel like you must walk on eggshells,"Every year since I have started they have removed more and more incentives. They don't give holiday pay, the managers make everyone feel like they are worthless. They don't allow people to have specified days off or they cut your hours and make it impossible to juggle life and work. It is a very stressful place because you are expected to live only for the company and never have a sick day. They belittle you and punish you for using your points. If you need specific days of they won't give you a schedule anymore and they coach good workers for ever having a bad day. They overlook bad work constantly as long as the person kisses the managers feet. It has become a very depressing and corrupt place to work.

Average ,"Most jobs within the logistics field will require a level of understanding that can’t be deterred because it’s backed by actual data. The most common is that you will work long hours, you will be required to work overtime, and most of the time, hard work goes unnoticed because you really can’t incentivize it.

Not like it used to be,The in store experience was one of the main reasons I worked retail. The interactions with customers and getting to know the regular customers.

Money,Walmart pays you and expects you to work. They give you nothing you work for everything. Management often are yes people and don’t know their role. It is a political environment and if you stand up for company policy management will find a way to fire you. The only time policy is applied is when it protects the company. Majority of people only work at Walmart due to pay not because it’s a company that values their employees. They lie about their work environment and “family” type caring. Walmart has not been Sam’s Walmart for years.

There's room for improvement. ,"Working as an overnight employee at Walmart is a unique experience that comes with its fair share of challenges and stress. As someone who has endured the nocturnal shifts, I can attest to the demanding nature of this environment. While there are certain aspects that Walmart could improve upon, there are also commendable aspects worth mentioning.The overnight workload at Walmart is often overwhelming. The limited number of staff members during these hours means that you are often responsible for multiple tasks simultaneously. Stocking shelves, organizing merchandise, and ensuring cleanliness of the store become your primary objectives. The workload is intense, and the pressure to meet tight deadlines can be burdensome.One of the most stressful aspects of working overnight at Walmart is the lack of proper staffing. The absence of adequate personnel can make it challenging to handle unexpected situations and provide quality customer service. This puts a considerable burden on the shoulders of the few individuals present, leading to increased stress levels and diminished efficiency. It would greatly benefit Walmart to address this issue by providing sufficient staffing during overnight shifts.",2,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Virginia Beach, VA",6/23/23,2023,6,23

Now they work on a skeleton crew with management expecting the same amount of work to be done. We could never keep up with the freight load for long because there would be a ton of 2 truck nights even during the slow period of the year. Hours constantly cut in order to make up for the excessive overtime earlier in the year because management cares more about their bonus than how the store runs. Management also plays favorites that never get in trouble meanwhile everyone else is constantly written up for performance. It is easy to move up since there is constantly people stepping down and being fired.

The new coach (our department lead) is implementing stupid, unnecessary changes to our work place. His way of getting stuff done isn't working out it's killing us. Employee morale is very low and people are quitting. If Walmart corporate wanted to do the right thing, they would get rid of the coach and bring back our old one. But they won't. Regular employees have no voice and it's a constant uphill battle with management. Our managers are loud, rude, and never help. They pick favorites. They trash-talk employees.

What was my breaking point was a daily introspect by staff and costumers about my personal life. I am apart of the LGBTQ+ community and I was constantly harassed with questions regarding my ""true"" identity and things of that nature.

Mixed bag,"Depends on which Walmart you work for, specifically. Ours is reputed as a friendly, large, clean WM by the customers; here's the other side of the story:I generally like/am neutral towards the majority of my coworkers, but the turnover rate is so unbelievably high it's hard to get attached/form acquaintanceships with anyone who hasn't been here long-term. The typical reasons for turnover are often the attendance point system/lack of PPTO (if you've been here a while), or severe lack of decent hands-on training (short-term/temp employees). The latter in particular is one of my biggest beefs with the company as a whole--they do some online stuff with newbies, then just chuck them to the wolves. Then, when the newbies need help/get stuck, they have no one to turn to, to figure out what to do-- they're surrounded by fellow newbies, managers are usually pulled in every which way and the more experienced cashiers are shoved onto SCOs, leaving the defenseless newbs to deal with impatient customers and having no clue how to resolve the issue. WM, IMHO, needs to take training tips from Lowes'--they not only trained me for a week online, but also had someone by my side for at LEAST 2-3 weeks til I got comfortable and KNEW what I was doing, or in case I had any questions or concerns. A good training session and set of managers will encourage both and will stay with their employees to make sure they KNOW the material and KNOW HOW TO PUT IT INTO PRACTICE. WM does none of that, and cares more about its money and bribing customers to give a ""good rating,"" rather than improving EVERYONE'S - more...",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Somerset, PA",6/22/23,2023,6,22
Tip baiting ,If you want to deliver trunk loads of groceries for Walmart for almost free then this is the job for you! All tips are almost always revoked after the delivery is completed.

Customers would ruin the store on purpose so there was not much incentive to try to keep the store clean. Except, when the managers/team leads told us to. We never got graded or tracked on individual performance on keeping the store clean but when we were together (2 or more people working a pallet or freight), we would try to be quick, especially if team leads or managers were hawking us, trying to make sure we do work but there was no incentive, regular stockers became team leads, by just stocking more, not stocking more properly.",3,Former Employee,Stocker Associate ,"Chamblee, GA",6/21/23,2023,6,21

Trying to get management to accommodate you is like pulling teeth, it's very frustrating.There is also a lot of drama amongst the other employees.

Micro managing mangers,Terrible place to work. The managers are always watching your every move. When you don't do as expected they berate you instead of training you to do better. Onboarding training for all jobs is done on a computer and it needs to be done in a certain amount of time sometimes when you are not even on the clock because you were so busy doing your assignments. Which ironically is against one of their own policies regarding doing work off the clock. You ask management to let you go to the computer room to work on your onboarding and they give you more assignments to accomplish instead.,1,Former Employee,Ops Associate ,"Appleton, WI",6/19/23,2023,6,19

Tell you what you want to hear when you ask want or need something and then it never happens. No one communicates to you at all to let you know what’s going on.

Focused more on numbers and goals than it's employees.,"Walmart is a great place to work if you thrive under pressure in a fast-paced environment with unrealistic expectations. For the last three years (since Covid hit) the average workload and production goals have skyrocketed while the total employee count plummeted and has continued to hold at unsustainable levels with high turnover. Most trainees don't stay past their on-boarding period or wind up burned out or quitting within the first six months. Those that don't either wind up fired due to entirely human mistakes accruing too many reprimands or they stay and contribute to the toxic, constantly stressed work environment. Management is a constant revolving door of transfers, so you never get to know who you work for very long before they switch out, and most of the time they only care about bonus goals. The same can be said for upper management as well, if they're even around often enough for you to get in contact with them. Every area in the warehouse is somehow understaffed and has been for years, so if you don't like mandatory overtime don't apply. Overall, it's a decent place to gain some experience in the warehouse and logistics sector but unless you thrive under extreme pressure doing two to three people's work to faultless standards, this may not be the place for you.",1,Former Employee,Warehouse Equipment Specialist/Certified Forklift Operator ,"Franklin County, KS",6/19/23,2023,6,19

"Started off fine after my transfer, but it got bad quick.","I transferred to this Walmart from the store located in Brookfield, Missouri, which was actually quite nice. It was smaller, but had a much tighter-knit team. When I transferred to the Irmo location, everything started off fine. It was busier, which I expected going into a larger store, and the management seemed comparable to the group I worked with. However, over the past year, things have gotten worse. My front-end team was actually quite pleasant, and I got along with many of my teammates. The only major player in my disdain for this store was my front-end coach. At first, they were pretty nice, going as far as to help me when I needed it. However, it wasn't until recently that I learned that they had been gaslighting not only me, but some of the cart staff as well. Combine that with Walmart's screwy attendance policy, and you can understand why people were leaving in droves. I do not appreciate being gaslit, nor does anyone else. It doesn't help that there doesn't seem to be any proper training put in place, as when I was given the secondary position of daytime maintenance, I went into it almost entirely blind. It was the skeleton crew that worked maintenance that helped me get a grasp on what I needed to do and how to do it. Did my coach help with any of that? Naaaaaah, of course not.It's perfectly fine to shop at this store, as it's generally a friendly store. However, if you want to apply for this store, be wary of which position you apply for. Whatever you do, don't aim for the front-end. Choose another department.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Irmo, SC",6/19/23,2023,6,19
There are better places to work ,"What is the best part of working at the company?Working at the Walmart at the location of Beach Blvd/Imperial in the city of La Habra was ridiculous and, by far, the worst of my life. Store management is only interested in promoting those who they think ( or will) have inappropriate relationships with them. If you want to a advance in the company at this location, don't expect to get there on your education, experience or work record, they want to see what you are willing to do for them personally...Managers watch as thieves steal large TV's and expensive items and repeated refuse to prosecute the few that the costumers detain. Then they fire hardworking employees to cover their own mistakes and incompetent actions. It is little surprise that this location has seen so many faces come and go in the last few years. Real store management is non-existent and upper management seem to be unwilling to care.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Co-workers are usually friendly What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Give the boss what he wants off the clock and you might get something What is a typical day like for you at the company?Managers who are morons and customers that are thieves",1,Current Employee,Customer Service ,"La Habra, CA",6/19/23,2023,6,19
"Great job to get in shape, compete, and earn good money. ","What is the best part of working at the company?While I cannot speak for other positions at WM, the orderfiller position at 7055 was one of the best jobs I've ever had. I LOVED the incentive-based pay, the competition and reading of the ""top 5 orderfillers"", the total compensation, and the physical work. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?4 a.m. start times were tough, but always feeling like you had a gun to your head in terms of achieving maximum rate, was tough as well. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Exactly like you'd think. Lots of corporate rah-rah stuff. You actually had to sing a silly little ""go Walmart"" cheer. However, the people that actually succeeded and thrived in the orderfiller position created a culture of absolute DOGS! To be a part of that elite group was fun. There were a lot of horses attached to a very large cart, but very few were doing most of the pulling. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Up EARLY. Clock in. Get assignment. Group Stretch and morning meeting. Get equipment. Start filling orders. Fill orders as fast as you safely can. RUN to and from first break. Stretch again (not as a group).  Get ""in the pick"" again. Fill equipment's fuel as necessary throughout the day. Orderfill hard and fast. Run to and from lunch break. Stretch. Orderfill again, now losing steam. Run to and from last break.

They worked me as a team lead and gave me team lead functions on my device but refused to give me the pay or the title and said they “didn’t give merit raises” for those who worked harder and had more responsibility. It is impossible to get a day off even if requested months in advance and everyone who works there are completely rude. ,1,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Brandon, FL",6/18/23,2023,6,18

Great pay but stressful days,The process and duties aren't hard to memorize or do. But management constantly places you in other departments of the store which leads you to be behind on your department and actual job then hold you accountable for things that didn't get done in your department and don't consider the other tasks you've done outside of your department as a reason you were behind.

Can never get a straight answer.,At first it seemed like it would be a great place to work. Training was decent but being thrown onto the floor not knowing what to do and how you could mess up was greater than being prepared. The pay was supposed to be increased for almost the whole duration of my time there but only went up when it was our raise time. We would always get the excuse of they're working on it or anything to try to keep people hanging on. The turnover rate is probably the worst I have seen. Don't even think about wanting to take PTO or anything because they have you fill out 3 -4 different forms/email and have to get approvals for all just to take a day off. They do not treat all their employees the same. If one does something they get fired but if a senior does it then they find a way to keep them. There is no stability in that place. Associates yell and get mad when you can't assist them or are being told to use the self report form instead of you just creating it for them. Honestly the list goes on and on about the cons.

Good place for a first job,I worked for walmart for 5 years and transferred to many positions in the store. If you do your job and stay in your area then you're pretty golden no matter what you do. Very much just a number or warm body not much encouragement to advance unless you want to be all up in your managers business and following then around. Tons of favoritism and not much involvement in teaching the younger people how to do the job. Promotions are all about who likes who not who's the one who will do the job properly or is the most hardworking. After the restructure not much incentive to grow or get promoted. Alot of things other associates get away with or don't do and you or your coworkers have to do their job more times then not. Not enough covered or expected to run a department on a skeleton crew. Flexibility at my store was top notch my people lead was great I loved her she helped me with a lot. Overall though for first job it's great but a career no I wouldn't suggest. My team lead and coach was always spread too thin between departments and it felt like they had no work life balance or had time for issues that needed to be addressed.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Murfreesboro, TN",6/15/23,2023,6,15

They don’t even interview new higher’s, basically if you have a pulse you get the job, the turnover rate is absolutely insane.

Easy job as a placeholder until you find a better career.,"What is the best part of working at the company?The pay is relatively ok compared to other retail/entry jobs with no qualifications. The attendance/call out system is fairly lenient. There's pto that you start accruing after 3 months that you're allowed to use whenever you want. It can be used to cover attendance points from calling out, even on ""key event dates."" The work can be a lot but most days, as long as you actually work consistently, it's pretty easy.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The managers tend to be angry all the time, probably from corporate stressing out the store manager which gets passed to the assistant managers and goes all the way down to the associates. It always seems to be understaffed and they still expect everything to get done.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The managers have ""favorites"" and half of your coworkers are lazy bums. It's hard to blame the managers for treating their employees like lazy kids, which a lot of the workers are, but it's frustrating when you're a full grown adult and do your job the best you can. It's very hard to receive any recognition for doing a good job.What is a typical day like for you at the company?We clock in, have a meeting with the whole crew and supervisor to discuss job assignment for that day. We go to our assigned department and get to work stocking. Breaks every two hours with an hour lunch.

No you miss a day even with a drs excuse it’s still counted as 1 point an you could get to 5 if you left early that was 1/2 a point if you were late that’s 1/2 a point. A no call no show is 2 points an well before I knew we were on the points I had already racked up 4 so I had court an didn’t tell them 3 weeks ahead of time so I was scheduled that day an it was go to work an he held in contempt or miss work an be fired!

"Good work, bad people","If you want to be mentally broken down for having a positive outlook and attitude, work at your local Walmart! They will give you too many tasks not assigned to you initially hired job position, managers do not listen to employee concerns, there is a massive lack of communication and training is non-existent. The list could go on and on. If the structures were improved upon instead of changed every 6 months, maybe the environment would change. Since I’ve worked for the company the work environment has only gotten more toxic and even physically dangerous. No one is given proper training. If any training is given, it seems to be ignored. Long-term employees want to quit over the continued deterioration of any structure. Managers never thank the work you do and point out what you could’ve done on top of all your pre-existent work. Injuries happen and management does not care and the safety issues persist. Walmart sucks away all my will to live. But the pay is nice if you don’t mind losing your humanity in the process.

Changing for the worse,"Your experience will depend on your pharmacy's market director. If you get one that is a troublemaker, I'd suggest finding another job. There is too much emphasis on trying to please people who just want to complain. Patients are not held accountable for disrespectful behavior towards pharmacy staff. There is favoritism for certain stores over others, which leads to resources and support being allocated unfairly. There are too many practice restrictions for pharmacists. You are not allowed to use your professional judgement or your interpretation of the law to decide whether or not to dispense a prescription. That is determined by your pharmacy manager and the market director. Management will get upset if you dispense 118 mL of tylenol solution to someone vs.120 mL that doctor specified on a prescription without calling for clarification. The job itself would be good if upper management did not interfere with pharmacists' ability to practice pharmacy. Overall, don't ever give management anything they can give you grief about. And don't bother going to the ethics department to complain. They are management, and will only side with management whenever a complaint arises.",2,Former Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,Southern California region,6/12/23,2023,6,12

Used to be a great job,I have worked with this company for 15 years as a pharmacy technician. Compared to other chains it’s not bad. There is somewhat adequate staffing. Unfortunately Walmart does not value long term employees anymore. I am maxed out on salary and will never get another raise. We also lost our my share bonuses. We were getting a Covid bonus for awhile. We were told that the new “wage investment” would equal to the amount we were getting in that bonus. It was nowhere near that amount. Walmart also no longer wants us to focus on filling prescriptions; they want us to focus on just vaccines.

Very stressful place to work.,"It doesn’t matter how hard you work or what you can do, unless you’re one of managements favorites you will never get an opportunity to advance in the company. It also doesn’t matter how long you’ve been with the company either because if they don’t like you or don’t want you around they’ll figure out a way to get rid of you. If you need a day off you have to fight bone and tooth for it because they’ll try to give you every excuse why they can’t give you time off. If you are having any kind of work related issues and you try to get them resolved by going to management, forget it because all they will do is turn there head unless it gets worse then they’ll pretend that they tried addressing the issue and resolving the problem when it’s too late. If you try to go to ethics over any issue concerning management, they will find out no matter if you did a report anonymous and they will retaliate and there’s no way to prove it because of how cricked they all are. They over work you to the point where you’re over exhausted and your managers never around to help take care of the department so you get to try to hold everything together but not get paid for it and you never get appreciated for the work you do.

Lack of Care for the Employee,"14 years proved to me that Most Companies Care nothing for the Employee and Walmart stands among the top.  I can honestly say Walmart is a better choice than Amazon but the lack of care in the work environment is equal to say the least.Despite what they advertise about Employee respect, if your responsible and your time management stands out as above average you DO NOT get recognized.

Felt isolated the first couple of months by employees.  Hard to make friends, felt like most didn't want to talk or be their or do their jobs.  The amount of theft that happens there can make someone feel disheartened.  Hard to want to do a good job and maintain store appearance with ripped packages and empty containers everywhere, everyday.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Not a good experience.  I was unhappy there most of the time.  They are flexible in letting you try different positions but after a waiting period, and the store discount doesn't start for three months probably to see if you can deal with the people and the workers for that long, but Walmart+ membership starts right away.  What is a typical day like for you at the company?Come in, figure out what I'm doing for that day, do the job, answer people's questions, clean up spills, defect stolen merchandise.

Demanding work environment,"I would like to say Walmart has changed my life and opened many doors for me. I could not thank the company more for hiring me as a Floor area manager fresh out of college. The company does has dark side such as not being a family friendly job.  Managers within the distribution center will work long hours and expect to meet KPI goals.  The company does not pay you overtime as a salaried member, which is expected, but the 15-16 hour days get old quickly.  Upper management applies more administrative work to area managers without removing some of the work load; on the other hand , the company has amazing benefits and one of the best cultural environment I have worked for.  I have worked for Nike. and the difference is night and day.  Walmart has diversity programs, feed associates once a month, and celebrates national holidays for all races.  This company demands alot from area managers , but I am grateful for all it has done for me.  The pay is decent.  Area managers are started at a base salary of 60,000 with a target bonus of 16% of your salary.

not so great,"If there is one thing I can say about Wal-Mart it's that they don't want anyone who thinks for themselves.  If you truly want to progress and are passionate about making a difference they will find any way they can to prevent you from moving up.  There is more interpersonal relationship promotions than any place I have ever worked in my entire life, it's about who you know or sleep with.  Cover ups for managers sleeping with employees, managers rubbing bonuses, which the regular employee is no longer allowed to get, in employees faces.  Having to work with unmotivated minors/young adults is one of the biggest downfalls as you will likely have to pick up the extra work of 3-10 others to make up for it.

Ogp.,"I worked at Walmart for 6 months in the OGP department. Before that I had never worked in this environment beforehand. But I was welcomed with open arms from staff, managers, and bosses. After the first few months/weeks, you could definitely tell ""who was the favorite"" according to management in my department. The people I met in my department are amazing people, others not so much. Management doesn't care if you are sick or call in sick, they want you to put in PTO if you are sick. Tell me how you are supposed to do that if you are sick?? Now the point system is ridiculous... now I do know that other companies are worse. If everyone was treated fairly and the child-like behavior wasn't there especially from grown adults. I would still have my job today.

Its a paycheck,"Walmart used to be a much better company to work for. Now its as though Walmart no longer cares about the customer or the associate. Pros- Hourly pay rate is usually higher than state minimum. Cons - Point based absence system. At 5 in 6 months they can fire you. Or - if you're a favorite, they can clear them for you. Generally point clearing isnt reserved for good associates though.  Retaining employees is difficult now, so they tend to bend over backwards to keep the bad employees.Zero accountability.  This falls in line with the first con, but reaches further. Walmart no longer holds anyone accountable, except the good employees.  Bad employees create more work for others or ignore policy and its ignored. If a good associate were to do the same, they get coached. Gone are the days of Walmart being happy with limited availability- now they want it all. This company wants you to eat, sleep and breathe Walmart.

There's no incentive to stay, especially when you barely get paid much more than associates hired after working so long. They do not want to work with you when you're sick or injured, unless you have the PPTO or tenure. Managers can be pretty toxic no matter what store you go to.

Don’t bother.,"Worked here for years and enjoyed it very much. Recent store management changes has proven that the store is going down the drain. Associates and even customers are complaining about poor management and lack of actual help. But that’s to be expected when dragging people from their departments to go do the work of someone else who happens to also be doing the work of somebody else. Oh and don’t forget the need to have a job/project that takes 3 people to do, but MUST be done by 1 person and MUST be done quickly. However you must also help customers and do everything else you should have had done. As stated don’t bother.

"Good people, bad people. Innovation and chronically understaffed. ","If you can get them, they have good benefits. The medical is decent. Dental is about as good as you can expect. Vision and other insurances are pretty good. The stock plan and education benefits are excellent. Corporate policy and decisions consistently keeps the store understaffed and expects you to do multiple peoples jobs. Especially middle management, Team leads are expected to do 5 peoples jobs for 1 1/2 peoples pay. As with any job that has customers, you always get the mix of good and bad. I personally had good supervisors to help me handle them, but I heard horror stories. You learn to identify the people who are here to punch the card and get paid for standing around, and who actually will work. Unfortunately, there is more of the former and less of the latter. The basic problem is that it all stays the same. Same issues, same communication problems, same BS; different face or policy. It gets worse, the bigger the store.Walmart is always searching for the ""One Best Way"".

They don't see you as a person, you're just another replaceable worker made to do anything they want even if it's above your pay grade and will take every opportunity to step on you.

The establishment does NOT take any notes from doctors even if you have a note saying you cannot work for a certain amount of time OR you have restrictions on work.

"Good to start, better to end.","Walmart offers many opportunities for people who are stagnant, struggling, or wanting more job experience - unfortunately, their stellar benefits come with a drawback. Working at Walmart is one of the circles of h-e-double hockey sticks. Be prepared for understaffed teams, verbal cruelty from customers, discrimination (in the area I was working at), mistreatment, working full shifts without any managers, being forced to work multiple jobs without fair compensation, and much more. While they do have amazing benefits (multiple types of insurance, free streaming services and Walmart +, employee discounts, free college for a few degrees, etc.) they all come at a price - they're meant to keep you trapped at Walmart. Have you ever entered a Walmart and wondered why there are so many retirement age / disabled people working there? It's because they desperately need the benefits Walmart offers, and will never quit, even if they're being mistreated. Great first job if you have thick skin and the ability to deal with mean, insulting, awful customers - I worked in customer service. Every employee is tired, very few enjoy their job, and we all are underpaid. If it's between Walmart and McDonald's, take Walmart. When you have no other options, the benefits are worth it.

maybe,"While Walmart pays well in Logistics, its management and staffing leave much to be desired. Management keeps giving more and more work to the same people.  Making the associates burn out, and getting tired of doing favors. The managers just chill in their office after the start-up meeting until there is a problem. That is not what a manager should do in my mind. And I do not understand that new outside hire managers make more than the new managers that come from the floor. Why is that? Where is the incentive? Hiring people that you have to have a translator for, having a bilingual person on staff but then getting mad when their main job wasn't done on time. When they were hired to do a completely different job than translating. The associate learned another language to read books honestly not to just be a translator. But they never cared to ask about that. Translators do not make more money even though if they didn't speak or sign the language that they learned the department wouldn't have run efficiently. I don't know what place needs but it needs people that care not people that just care about numbers. It's hard to move up if you have a specialty job. Because they do not want to train people to do their job. It would hurt their numbers. It does have its pros like a discount card, paying for certain colleges, and a paycheck. But once you really get into it it makes you wonder if it is really worth putting up with the bull when the things you care about mean nothing to them.

No,"As an employee at Walmart's Online Grocery Pickup (OGP) department, I am compelled to share my overwhelmingly negative experience working in this role. From the moment I joined, it became evident that this position was nothing short of a nightmare. Here's why Walmart's OGP turned out to be the worst job I've ever had:Poor Management: The management at Walmart's OGP department was simply atrocious. The supervisors were disorganized, ineffective, and lacked any form of leadership skills. They were often absent when needed, leaving employees stranded with no guidance. Their constant incompetence resulted in chaotic work environments, endless delays, and frustrated customers.Unrealistic Expectations: Walmart expects OGP employees to perform miracles. The workload is unreasonably high, and there is never enough staff to handle it. The pressure to meet strict delivery deadlines without adequate support is not only overwhelming but also detrimental to the well-being of the employees. This excessive workload leads to stress, burnout, and a lack of work-life balance.Insufficient Training: Walmart's OGP provides minimal training to new hires, if any at all. Employees are expected to learn on the job, which only exacerbates the already chaotic work environment. Lack of proper training not only leads to mistakes but also compromises the quality of service provided to customers. It's frustrating to be held accountable for errors that could have been avoided with adequate training.Inadequate Staffing: The OGP department is consistently understaffed.

"Good people, Trash pay, trash job","The job is pretty straightforward and there’s nothing hard about it from a mental standpoint. However, the pay is it necessarily worth the amount of effort that you put in. During my time there I worked in the dairy section, stocking everything from yogurt to eggs and juice. You’re constantly in a freezer or refrigerator tossing around boxes pulling out things that need to go out to restock the shelves. The job is OK but not some thing anybody would want to do long-term in my opinion. If you’re in college, or you’re just trying to make ends meet until you find something better then the job is fine. You’re opening boxes and walking back-and-forth to put things where they need to go all day. If you have a good team, then the job is smooth but if it’s short staffed, then it can be a little stressful. Management will look at you to make more things happen until they hire more folks. In my store we had three people resign from my section in the same week due to college graduations. As a result, the store manager called all the leads and coaches into my department to work freight that had piled up. The employee discount is trash. 10% off most things which doesn’t even eliminate the taxes. You also be called to any part of the store that is short staffed to help assist other departments, and do things outside of the scope of what you were initially hired for.  Meh It’s a job.

Fun and helpful coworkers. ,What is the best part of working at the company?Nice coworkers. Decent pay. Work was not too difficult once you get used to it.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Being yelled at. Being rushed. Cleaning up after customers while they were still in the store. The stealing.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Most of it was decent. Just a one bad apple who thought being in charge meant it was okay to be abusive.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Walk to work.

Unorganized and bad management ,I worked here for a little over a year. If you were on the floor you were expected to go outside your department to stock numerous carts with no direction. The place was always in a mess and there was no great leadership. HR was so condescending when you brought an issue to them (such as SA). The tiny discount you got with the awful pay just wasn’t worth it. ,3,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Port Clinton, OH",6/5/23,2023,6,5

Time,The normal day is time management if you have a lot to do it’s best to knock out the most time consuming task. I’ve worked at 4 different stores and floated over a dozen stores the constant issue is how tasks get delegated. Management consistently go over one another like a power trip thing because every task is important for one reason or another when essentially the job is stock shelves and barely assist the customer. If you work in one department you are expected to stay in said department and not wonder off into a different part of the store. Be mindful of your breaks because the two 15 minute breaks are on the clock meaning you are paid for it so you can be written up for stealing time. The other issue with the company is the fact you have to go through Sedgwick for any type of leave and Walmart doesn’t directly take sick notes and you have a five point system implemented over a rolling 6 months. So if you have children or tending to a loved one that’s not the best. You get a half a point for being 10 minutes late and/or 10 minutes over the time you scheduled. You also get a full point for a call. If you get a no call no show that’s 1 full point plus a full point for missing your shift.,3,Former Employee,Cap Team Supervisor ,"Boone, NC",6/5/23,2023,6,5

Teamwork & Management,Ask for working there we first had to get trained by somebody looking at Walmart automotive we work in three different divisions for the oil change and also we work in the tire division we do train with the oil first it depends on how fast your learning skills are if you can ask to go to the tires I have work with the oil for a couple months and I didn't have any time to go train for the tires because of their hires are coming in so I think the managermint was also the manager of the store the whole store was the manager of our department but I don't think that was well chosen if anything automotive of Walmart when there is a lot of people coming in as customers to get their oil change the timing was very slow I'm working on one person's car but that's just my opinion other than that I still love working there maybe because I love what I was doing,3,Former Employee,Automotive Technician ,Brea CA,6/5/23,2023,6,5

The job is easy, but can be stressful due to unprovoked hostility from customers and management. Benefits were ok. There was a 90 day wait from the time you start at full time, the catch is that you must average 40 hours a week and maintain it to acquire those benefits. HR would try to schedule you so that you would hit just below the average to keep you from getting the benefits.Management had very little concern for the employee’s personal and family life. Several were fired over absences due to family emergencies during my time there. I was insulted by a manager at one point for not speaking “clearly”.Working for Walmart was not a pleasant experience. Would not recommend unless you are in serious need of the benefits, and even then, it will be a constant fight to maintain the minimum requirements to gain them due to shady acts by HR.

They are a facility ran from corporate offices by email. There is no individuality with the managers. They are all programmed to manipulate and gaslight.

Poor management and favoritism ,"Out of all the jobs I have had, this is by far the least enjoyable one. Overworked with little help and management is nowhere to be seen throughout the night. Management has their little circle of friends that they allow to do whatever they want with no repercussion whilst others are punished for doing the same thing. It feels like high-school all over again with how much drama and gossip amongst management and associates about other associates goes around, even when they're right in front of them. Overall, very poor management and not worth losing and destroying not only mental health, but physical health as well for a job that overworks you.",1,Current Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Myrtle Beach, SC",6/3/23,2023,6,3

The company offers its employees a comprehensive benefits package, including health insurance, retirement plans, and discounts on products.However, Walmart has faced criticism for its labor practices, particularly around issues such as low wages, limited opportunities for advancement, and scheduling practices that can make it difficult for employees to balance work and personal commitments.Overall, working at Walmart can be a good option",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Chicago, IL",6/3/23,2023,6,3

Decent pay and benefits and its a job and thats reality in today's world. Should have gone into optometry ,"What is the best part of working at the company?Good benefits like 401K match up to 6% after so many years.   Healthcare for family was like 700 per 2 weeks.  PTO was high because they rolled vaca and sick pay into pto.  After 5 yrs I got around 208 hours of PTO.  OT we got a differential of 5$ but not sure if that has changed.   Bonus is good if you hit ALL their targets which can be done but requires a lot of work and being on top of it.  Up to 24K/yr bonis for PIC but the average payout for PIC is around 12-15k/yr.   Staff RPh gets around 3-4k on average.  Computer requires a lot of man hours which WM has cut back a lot since 2016.  Their system is nice because it's built on safety so it does things slowly and there are a lot of steps from drop off to check out hence a lot of man hrs are needed to make the process smooth.  Yearly raised was 1 or 2% until 2018 then yrly raises became 25 cents, yes 25 cents, that's an extra 500$ before tax so you can take your family out to a nice buffet in Vegas for 3 people ONCE per yearWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Surveys and negative comments.   You must keep survey points up and every negative comment requires the PIC and RPh on duty to call the customer and apologize and promising never to do that again.  What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Work environment would be great if they would add 20 to 30 hrs on top of what their baseline tech hours is.

Toxic and hostile work environment ,"The upper management treats the other management horrible. Which makes everyone tense and afraid to be in trouble for not working hard enough even if you’re working your very hardest. If employees have issues and tell the management, they retaliate and keep everything amongst themselves just so they don’t risk looking bad. They don’t ever do anything to help the associates or make them feel appreciated. Anything brought forward by an associate is ignored and pushed aside. It even goes as far as watching a fellow associate getting a knife pulled on him by a team lead and nothing was ever done about it by upper management.

Not fun as a newbie,"So far I’ve only been here for a week and I’m struggling really bad. At the customer service desk there’s a lot of rules and policies that you need to know and follow. Since I’ve been working I’ve been left at the desk by myself for at least an hour at a time and it’s very tough. It’s the hardest when you’re by yourself and no one else is around you and your team lead is running around so you can’t ask for help and you have to call a team lead and ask them to come over and help you. Not only does it get annoying to them but it kinda makes me feel a little embarrassed and like I can’t do my job even though I literally just started. I just wish they would think about how that feels to employees first. But I think after I get everything down being there by myself shouldn’t be a problem I’m just not ready now. Other than that it’s laid back for the most part and you have a lot of responsibility like making sure you take the time your supposed to on breaks and clock out on time because no one’s really keeping a super close eye on you all the time like that.

"If Management Knows Your Department, You Can Succeed","A normal day usually involves following a pretty strict schedule for making fresh food or cutting lunch meats/cheeses for deli and bakery department shelves during peak times then removing the food when it's no longer fresh. You'll need good team work and great time management skills. This is a good job for people who want to do the same thing every day with no surprises. You're manager is supposed to help you fill everything when needed, but typically you won't need much help once you get used to the work.The only problems I had working this job were that when a person left the job, there were no replacements. Management refused to hire for deli and bakery. The tight schedule we maintained fell to shambles quickly. It became impossible to finish all of our tasks. We were constantly told to work harder to finish until the managers had to step in and see for themselves that they needed more workers, but in the end they still never fully replenished numbers for the department. I left frustrated. The potential we had for an easy job where you could just talk to customers, prep, cook, and clean up was basically ruined.

The part of the job I don’t like is the workload. There is a process that should be followed but at least where I am it is not. Working freight, answer the phone, helping customers, cleaning, zoning, cashiering, returning products to shelves, changing mods, price changes, help cover call outs, and taking care of our equipment are what is expected each day, but you are alone in your department having to balance all this and still take your mandatory 3 breaks. Trust when I say you love taking your breaks but I rarely am not interrupted during them.

Cashier ,"I am writing this job review to share my experience as a cashier at Walmart. I worked in this role for a considerable period, and I would like to provide an honest assessment of the position and the company as a whole.First and foremost, Walmart is a well-established retail giant known for its extensive range of products and widespread presence. As a cashier, I had the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of customers daily. This aspect of the job was truly rewarding as it allowed me to engage with people from different backgrounds and contribute to their shopping experience.The training process at Walmart was comprehensive and well-structured. I received thorough training on operating the cash register, handling transactions, and providing excellent customer service. The management team and supervisors were supportive, always available to answer questions and provide guidance whenever needed. They fostered a positive work environment, emphasizing teamwork and efficiency.One of the key aspects of being a cashier at Walmart is handling high volumes of transactions and maintaining accuracy. The fast-paced nature of the job required me to be attentive and efficient while scanning items and processing payments. This aspect could be challenging at times, especially during peak hours, but it helped me develop strong multitasking and time-management skills.Another positive aspect of working as a cashier at Walmart was the opportunity for career advancement.

Good place,"This is a review mainly for their curbside pick up option after having ordered online.  The online ordering system is pretty good and gives you options to select products that can be replaced.  There are different pick up time options available to suit your convenience.I checked into the app as I left my house.  If you have location services enabled, the app automatically alerts you to input the parking spot number when you reach the parking area.  The employees were found to be working hard delivering the purchases to several customers who were already parked.  One of them came to my car and I dint even have to roll down the window, they asked to see an ID to be displayed thru the glass.  He said the order will be out momentarily.  The wait time was the only downside.  I waited for almost 30 mins before the order started to be loaded into the trunk of my car.  Once the order was out, the employee was very quick, efficient and friendly.In these trying times, I did not mind the wait time because the employees were performing a tough and risky job that was done so well.

Terrible management ,"Notably picks favorites. The managers seem to be on power trips and treat you as below them. They expect you to have it all together after your first couple minutes of being there. Unreasonable expectations required. If you’re lucky, you can get by with just doing your work and they won’t bother you. However, that ties in with them picking favorites so just don’t be one of the unlucky ones. Pros: the benefits you can take advantage ofPotential advancement in your schooling levelCons: the place just needs to do better as a whole ",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Cornelia, GA",5/29/23,2023,5,29

Nice and manageable job. Management is the only issue,"Typical day: Viz-pick at least 2x a day ( beginning of your shift & before you go on your lunch or before the end of your shift.)Zone the shelves Replenish the shelves(if needed)Work palletsUnload truck(varies)Help customers(Occasionally)Claim expired or broken goodsClean and sanitize work area Clock out Things i learned: make sure that you are ALWAYS doing something. Even if its something as small a zoning, make sure that you're doing something bc you don't want to give management any more reason to fire you.Make sure that you request your Protected Paid Time Off( PPTO) or Paid Time Off(PTO) either the same day as you requested it or the day before you are going to leave. Ik that's bad or backwards bc you would think that it would be smart to put it in advance. However, putting it in advance gives you a higher chance for your request to get denied by someone in management. By putting it in at the last minute, the system automatically grants your request. The only way this method won't work is if you don't have enough hours saved up for your request.the hardest part of the job: management can make the easiest jobs unbearably bad and/or stressful. Most times, many members in management are either on vacation or leaving early. You frequently get pulled to help another department while getting in trouble for not finishing your department's work.The most enjoyable part of the job: co-workers can help make the shift go by so much faster.",3,Current Employee,Team Associate ,"Augusta, GA",5/29/23,2023,5,29

The pay is not bad compared to other retail starting wages, but there is very little room for progression, and without much to really work towards, the job becomes extremely monotonous.",2,Current Employee,Stocking Associate ,"Concord, NH",5/28/23,2023,5,28

Managers have it made everyone else is nothing to them. ,What is the best part of working at the company?It's nothing to write home about.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?There are two classes managers and the underclass. If you want to be a number and nothing more apply right away. They send you home often for lack of work. It seems like the managers try to keep their labor costs as low as possible to boost their bonuses. They play favorites. There's no teamwork its every person for themselves.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Favoritism is prevalent and it's a negative environment with everyone out for themselves. Seniority is used for making promotion decisions. This makes for an environment where management is lazy and they put pressure on the underclass.What is a typical day like for you at the company?It's  a real grind.

It’s fine. It’s Walmart.,It’s Walmart. What do you expect? That’s what you get. Management can be frustrating and breathing down your back. Costumers are generally okay but a few will be stinkers.

Reasonable Job for Those Looking for a Start in Retail,"It's hardly the worst retail environment to work for, but in general the corporate management expects more and more productivity out of less and less employees. Perpetual staffing issues and lackluster incentives are pushing out some of the older, more reliable associates and that's beginning to catch up with the company. I could see someone beginning their retail career here to get some experience and the discount card is nice, but I would suggest exploring different employment options until Walmart home office decides to better staff the store or alternatively raise the wages to meet the increased workload and lack of incentives for regular associates.

"The pay is descent, but not worth so much time lost with my kids.","What is the best part of working at the company?The benefits package is great and so is the salary for not having much experience or a grad degree. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?There is NO work life balance. Salary means they own you and expect you to stay until the job gets done. If you have small kids, I strongly recommend you do NOT accept a Coach position at Walmart. Last minute pickup from daycare arrangements are made at least 3 times a week and on average I see my kids 10 hours a week if lucky and they suffer emotionally because of it. This company does not care at all about salary members of management and working every single weekend. Next, the expectations are unrealistic if your store is not performing well. Be careful about which store you chose to work at. Your store manager can make or break the experience. Last, AP Coaches get jerked around and hugely taken advantage of by store managers that discriminate against AP because part of our job involves includes sitting at a desk. AP should have NEVER been put under the store managers because some store managers think they can do what they feel like instead of us doing our jobs.

Decent work but bad management,Honestly this job isn't the worst. You get a lot of opportunities to succeed and the work is easy with nice pay. The problem lies with Walmart's corporate and store management. At least at my store it was horrible. It felt like I was back in high school again with senseless drama and cartoonishly mean managers. Favoritism and poor treatment around the whole store. Corporate decisions often made us feel overworked and caused disruptions in the workplace.

Get off Christmas but if you want paid have to use your own pto. They say holiday pay is built into pto but if that's the case you get no vacation time really. They got rid of sick time and if you had any you were basically screwed. For a big company it's not a good atmosphere. Last thing the anti union meetings are absolutely hilarious.

Management does not care about their employees.,"I picked up a cashiering job at Walmart as a second job. I put the days that I was available to work. Little did I know that saying I was available on Friday nights meant that I would be scheduled EVERY single Friday night. Every Sunday a nine hour shift that was right in the middle of the day so it ruined every Sunday. I talked to my Coach and she said she would look into it. I asked her a couple weeks later and she said she never did. I then submitted an availability change form to try and change my schedule so I had some work/family balance on weekends and she didn't approve it. They were always late on giving you your break and I never got out of there on time at the end of my shift. In fact, they would ask me to start shutting down registers when my shift ended. The last straw was when their Loss Prevention Officer stopped me when I was on my way to break after seeing me go through the self check out line and asked if I was going on break and if he could look in my bag. I showed him and he clearly saw it was a couple food items for my break and the receipt right in the bag. He then went on to ask me for my receipt and when I showed him again that it was in my bag, he dug his hand in the bag to pull out the receipt to check it.

Wasn’t worth the pay when I worked there, but I’ve seen they are hiring for a decent wage now.",4,Former Employee,Dairy Stocker ,"Lebanon, TN",5/22/23,2023,5,22
Management has a lot of room for improvement.,"The management there besides the HR lady is awful, disrespectful and treats everyone like they’re doing something wrong when they don’t train you. They said unfortunately we gotta learn the job on the fly and when you don’t do something right they say it in the meetings and when you say you don’t know any different they don’t care. ",1,Former Employee,Deli/ Baker/ stocker ,"Paola, KS",5/22/23,2023,5,22
Bad,No training. Bunch of red flags about how they are against unions. Low pay. It’s not great. Maybe if you have no other options. I wouldn’t recommend. ,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,Ohio,5/22/23,2023,5,22
Occurrence rules not fair,"When working here, you better know someone in the main office, because the assistant management and up like to frown upon the front end and are always complaining to the CSM’s about having too many people on the clock. Because it affects their bonus, no one else gets bonuses for the hard work. The interview process is difficult, they don’t answer your questions, they barely answer phones in the office, occurrence process is complicated and no one can determine if an emergency will arise or how long it’ll take, 5 days for a 12 month period is not fair to anyone in that situation. THE FRONT end struggles the most, can’t have too many associates on the clock because it affects upper managements bonus. Too many bosses trying to micromanage. ",1,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"La Marque, TX",5/22/23,2023,5,22
Horrible Managers,"While a decent place to work, management was exhausting with their constant helicoptering staff. Rather than be entrusted to working your department you are typically treated like a child (unless you know management which I did.). I watched several employees be handed the worst tasks consistently over others who simply stood about and did nothing. If you want to suceed at walmart, don't lift a finger. If you like to really work however, you're better going someplace else",2,Former Employee,Self Checkout Associate ,Ames Ia,5/22/23,2023,5,22
Somewhat relaxed work environment but management was not very helpful ,"I was able to choose the shift that I worked which was very handy.

"Diverse, fast-paced workplace","Walmart is a great company to work for, I worked for a few years as a student and it is great as a first job.

Don't waste your time,"I liked working there until management started decided to fire almost everyone from the department and takes their sweet time rehiring people.

Don’t tell them you can wait for a break,"I was a cashier as a freshman in college. Because I was pretty young, I could go a little longer between breaks, so I told management this to give the older people a chance to get to break a little faster. What I didn’t realize, was that gave them a reason to just completely skip me entirely. I had to fight to go on break sometimes because it was well over 2 hours since I should have gone to lunch. I hardly had time between classes and getting to my shift, I never could get any homework or papers done.

"Cut and dry, you get what you get.","The kind of workplace where someone who has been there for 20 years can stand around and do nothing while your manager yells at you to work faster. Benefits are reasonable if not ideal, IF they allow you to be listed as full time to be eligible for them. All in all: it’s a job. At times it’ll be annoying, but nobody will ever fire you for not getting things done. You could get away with being lazy, but so can all your coworkers.

Was good is now bad,Ive worked here for over two years over all it was an alright experience but they literally tricked me into being moved up front to cashier where they are now forcing employees to pester customers to give them 5 stars which gives all the managers a higher bonus. Only reason why people stay at this store up front is because one of the team leads makes the experience bearable.,2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lake Saint Louis, MO",5/21/23,2023,5,21

From my experiences, I know that working for Walmart allows you to be yourself without feeling judged. With 37 million customers served globally every day, Walmart brings together people from all different walks of life. Working for Walmart also means taking regular breaks, with full-time workers being given two 15 minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch break for their 9 hour shifts. This level of care for workers is quite unique in my experience.

Stable work but no advancement,"Walmart is a great place to work if you need a stable job and don't mind working in a retail store.However, don't expect easy advancement, because Management plays favorites to the extreme. The best path to a promotion is to befriend your managers and constantly ask for a promotion. Hard workers who focus on the task at hand and not on chatting with every manager that walks by will only be rewarded with more and harder work to do.Stores are constantly understaffed and constantly hiring, so expect an environment where your coworkers can change month to month, and where morale is consistently low.Off time is supposed to be provided on a first come, first served basis, but can be denied for almost any reason, even with months in advance notice. Off time is also slowly accrued at about 15 minutes a day for PTO and 15 minutes a day for PPTO.Overall - Walmart is good for going to work and drawing a paycheck, but don't expect to enjoy it or advance.",3,Current Employee,Produce Associate ,"Madison, AL",5/20/23,2023,5,20

"Decent Pay, mediocre management, good benefits","Walmart gets too much criticism as a workplace, in my experience. Hearing about a number of other retail jobs, Walmart is actually pretty chill. The pay is as good as other retailers, but they are generally willing to give you more hours. Benefits are better, better priced anyway. Not to mention, they probably have the best break and lunch system. Associates bond through annoyance of customer service better than some other stores. Management is sometimes pretty bad, other times are alright. All of the usual annoyances apply at times, but comparably, really pretty decent.",4,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Ft.

Great subordinates; awful superiors and colleagues,The work here is not too bad. It’s minimal but at any moment can get stressful as with any Job. The positive is that the subordinate are usually pleasant some days are better than others but you learn each persons traits what makes them tick as you work with them and help them grow and eventually it’s a cakewalk. The issue lies in the colleagues and superiors. My superior in particular is quite demanding but doesn’t help at all and is very passive aggressive. I’ve brought up ethics issues that my colleague has shown or displayed and they are not big issues to her as it seems calling a coworker a monkey or bullying an associate into dyeing her hair are not big deals to her.

I can't stand it that the people who make decisions on how to do the job have never actually done the job so they have no idea what it's actually like.

Bad place to work!!!,"Over the course of the time I’ve been employed at Walmart, I’ve been nothing less of dissatisfied with this job. The overnights team is treated like garbage while Cap 2 is a bunch of unsupervised teenagers. The pay is fair and I do like the two breaks and a lunch. However, the level of disrespect my overnight team has been given over the past couple of years is nothing short of baffling. Upper management is unhelpful and uncaring towards us. Most of the coaches for overnights haven’t been the greatest either. They lack good planning and are often disorganized. They do not utilize associates in the areas where they shine. I highly recommend staying away from working overnights let alone working at Walmart.",1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Hermiston, OR",5/18/23,2023,5,18

Awful place that isn't worth the paycheck ,"Where do I even begin, most of the training is virtual and you get next to none hands on experience, you'll have 5 people training you on a single subject each offering different answers and they'll all be wrong. The system sets new employees up to fail from the start. They say no graphic tees for employees but then you'll notice all the female staff wearing graphic tees. It's constant hypocrisy like that that drove me up the wall. Management is utterly unhelpful as they'll take roughly 20 minutes to help out. There is an obnoxious amount of nepotism when it comes to being promoted, it's based on whoever management likes the most. If that doesn't bother you this will, you'll have no social life because of this job they'll schedule you as many days as inhumanly possible, don't even get me started on attempting to get some days off.

Not family oriented ,Walmart attendance runs off an unrealistic point system. This job is not for single parents. The managers are inconsistent and show much favoritism.

Started out well until management change,Walmart doesn’t value the benefit for their associates. Walmart prioritizes the coaches who make triple what a normal associate makes along with a bonus the size of my annual salary based off my performance. My time with walmart started good until they had management change and the new guy was absolutely unfit for the position. Treated people terribly and used his power to get what he wanted.

Highly Recommend Working Elsewhere,"I was first hired for Walmart back in 2014 and it was great! I loved my managers, my coworkers and the customers. I was appreciated for what I did and I felt that I could ask for time off when I needed it. I left temporarily from October of 2017 to June of 2018 for another job and I had to start over again as a new hire. I noticed a massive change in the ethics of the company. Suddenly, it wasn't about the well being of the associates but how to make the customers happy and to stuff the pockets of upper management. I noticed this much more when I was an hourly supervisor. I was under CONSTANT stress, I cried often, I ended up being diagnosed with anxiety because I was expected to work on the front line right in the middle of COVID. I took the job right before one of the busiest times of the year (Thanksgiving) and was thrust into being a manager. Then we had two months of down time after the holidays before everything changed once again as we were faced with COVID and all the new policies and procedures. Finally, I went back in early 2023 as a part time cashier because I needed more money. I was hired to work on the weekends 9-6 on top of my 8-5 job Monday through Friday. I soon learned it was all too much and asked if I could just work 5 hour shifts on the weekends instead of 8. I was approved for one week then denied because I was only employed for 2 months. Then I was constantly feeling like I wasn't able to meet up to their ridiculous demand of asking customers about taking surveys, which I learned was just what my store did; it was no company-wide.

Simple job but very disorganized,The job is easy if you’re okay with standing for 8 hours straight. Breaks are frequent (every two hours) and last long enough to get snacks and use the restroom.

Additionally, despite being promised two 15 minute paid breaks per shift, I regularly only received one. Despite being scheduled for a lunch break at 7:00pm, I was regularly not relieved until 7:30 or 8:00.

I like the bread,"I had the pleasure of working as a cashier at Walmart for the past two years, and I must say it has been a fulfilling experience overall. While every job has its ups and downs, Walmart provided me with numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth. Allow me to share my thoughts and impressions with you.Working as a cashier at Walmart allowed me to develop essential customer service skills. I had the chance to interact with a diverse range of customers, which greatly enhanced my communication and problem-solving abilities. The interactions were often fast-paced and demanding, but the experience taught me how to remain calm and composed even in challenging situations.One aspect that stood out to me was the team-oriented environment at Walmart. The management and fellow colleagues were always supportive and created a positive work atmosphere. Whenever I had questions or needed assistance, my supervisors and team members were readily available to lend a helping hand. It felt great to be part of a team that valued collaboration and encouraged personal growth.The company also places great emphasis on training and development. Walmart provided comprehensive training sessions, both during the onboarding process and periodically throughout my employment. The training programs were well-structured and ensured that I had a solid understanding of the company's policies, procedures, and the efficient operation of the cash register system. I always felt prepared and equipped to handle any situation that came my way.Furthermore, Walmart offers competitive pay and benefits. - more...",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Indianola, IA",5/15/23,2023,5,15

They don’t care about you… ,Worst place to work. Management is power hungry and they don’t care if you’re admitted to the hospital or a death in the family. They only care about your attendance and productivity. Which is never.  EVER enough.  Worked there for 8+ years.  There’s not enough space here to properly explain.  May the odds be ever in your favor. Also.  I was fired after all that time due to my attendance.  Even though they refused to take me off schedule while I was admitted in the hospital fighting for my life.    I was fired by someone I trained 6 years prior.  They found any way to get me since I got sick.   Eventually it was a blessing in disguise. But yeah.  Be ready to be worked like a dog and made to feel bad for needing a day off.

Walmart,"I wouldn’t recommend working here unless people you know personally in your area know the Walmart there has good treatment to employees. I am not pleased on how they treat their elderly employees, apparel workers, and I am not pleased by the favoritism. When I worked there I was paid only $12 an hour when I also worked outside of my position because they didn’t have anyone else on schedule for other areas of the store, in which one time I had to work in electronics but had no idea what I was doing and panicked, due to not even having the skill set to work in that area and embarrassing myself trying to help customers the best I can.

Quality work environment with attainable and achievable goals,The job is fairly easy as an overnight stocker. The overnight hours do you leave you tired but are given value through higher wage.

It's not the same at all walmarts,Walmart is a good company to work for if you are looking to advance quickly. Not all Walmarts are the same the biggest factor is the people. I loved working for Walmart with my store manager because he believed in me and allowed me to grow. The guidance he gave was incomparable to any I had ever seen throughout my life of working. He always stayed true to the moment and would give credit where it was due. He is the type of person to let you know your mistake and help you work to correct it permanently. Walmart is a great company and has endless opportunities.  But just like any great thing you must be willing to a assist in making it and keeping it great ROI the return on investment.  The cons of working with the store that I worked with is that people are going to always show they ate human and will do what they can to see you fail if you are doing better than them. To be a leader is to take accountability for all that you lead good and bad. And I also feel that being appreciated and not shown that you are replaceable also brings out the best in anyone. And they did not do this for my associates who worked very hard. There's a lot of pros and cons working for this company and it is definitely a back breaker. But once you've worked for Walmart successfully you can make it anywhere. ,3,Former Employee,Production Line/ Shipping Assistant Supervisor ,"San Jose, CA",5/14/23,2023,5,14

They don't stay true to your availability and constantly try to schedule you outside of it or will personally ask if you can work other days and times and sometimes ask you to work at different locations. They also do not train very well on the floor they toss you on there and basically expect you to know everything from some videos, reading, and answering questions from them. Sometimes leads or management will literally follow some associates around when they send them to break or to do go backs to make sure they don't take a minute longer on break or they expect go backs per L-cart you take to be done in 15 mins even when you got 3 different departments and don't really know where things go without looking up there location. They are rude to there employees and make us feel like we aren't human or that anything that isn't work related isn't valid. There bad at giving out breaks I tend to get close to or do hit my 5th hour very often.

I think most retail companies does that",4,Current Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Simi Valley, CA",5/14/23,2023,5,14
POOR rating,The HR department is very unprofessional and treat most people with no respect. The head of HR needs people skills and learn how to follow up. Once you’re hired you seem to be no existent. Very poor skills for a company this size and with employees that work so hard.

Customers dont matter, employees don't matter,  only struggling managers trying to save their own skin.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's a quantity over quality culture.

"Good pay, great benefits ","My time at 6038 was amazing. I would highly recommend any driver to consider Walmart as their next driving job. The PTO and the vast number of schedules they offer is nothing like any other trucking job. They’re not a trucking company, it’s a retail operation with trucks. Never pushed to do anything you legally can’t. Equipment it top notch, always clean and always ready to go in your start day. I would still be there had I not needed to be home more.

"Great short-term, less great long-term","Walmart is a great job to have if you are working summers or inbetween jobs. Pay is great for your starting responsibilities and most individuals working at walmart dont have god complexes. That being said everybody knows that loyalty to long-time workers has diminished but it's still sad to see. One you hit 6 months working at walmart you SHOULD get a full-time position but it is more likely that you will have to ask for a couple more months unless there are management that really like you. Additionally, once you've been working there for that period of time you will likely be crosstrained in order to complete job tasks for multiple ares of the store on the daily.As a home goods/homelines associate my day starts with organizing grocery with other associates for about 2 hours before I can begin tasks in my own department. Then if it's a busy day I will most likely be pulled multiple times throughout the day to work a cash register. If an associate in apparel quit/called out, I will most likely be working in apparel (dressing room, jewlery counter, organizing/cleaning, doing returns) for AT LEAST an hour to cover a lunch.It's demoralizing if you expect appreciation and only receive additional duties.BUTThe people who work at walmart are vastly different from eachother but as a whole are typically down to earth individuals who will make working at the company well worth it.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lampasas, TX",5/13/23,2023,5,13

Problems will be brought up my multiple people in the pharmacy as well as patients and nothin will be actuallly addressed or changed. They just act like they are listening to the concerns but would rather avoid confrontation or work together as a team to find solutions. If a solution ever is reached, they dont enforce them. If you have questions about pay or benefits you have to go searching for the info yourself in employer resources and calling company help desk because management doesnt know much about the positions they are managing.. Walmart doesnt care about how valueable an employee is to the team or to the patients. Amazing employees with extensive knowledge, skill and potential will get paid less than others in the same position who dont and cant do anywhere near the amount/quality of work just because theyve been at the company for less time.

Stressful and hateful ,"What is the best part of working at the company?Meeting new people and the benefits were decent. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The management at the store that I worked out was terrible. They had harassment going on and they never handled it. They were also incompetent and never appreciative. I enjoyed working there. I would’ve stayed if it wasn’t for the inept and hateful managers. Everything else about my job, I liked. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The work environment in our particular store was stressful, demanding and unappreciative. The management made it a culture of unkindness and they treat their employees terribly. This is why they hire all the time. It’s not because they can’t find good employees, they have them, they just don’t know how to treat people. Basic human decency would be nice. What is a typical day like for you at the company?We would start off with a meeting that would berate us for the day before.

Terrible,Walmart does not care about their associates at all. They will point you for any reason at all that you can't come to work. In the hospital they will give you attendance points and fire you. Don't accept doctors notes when you're sick. Well give attendance points if you can't make it to work due to a natural disaster. They do not care about your family or you being sick. If you're sick they tell you to come to work and wear a mask. They treat the minors way better than any adult working there. They do not properly train you for your role but will write you up if you do something wrong even though you have no idea that it's not the right thing to do. The management won't help you when you have a customer that's not acting right. They will stand around and laugh and not do anything.

Not Too Hard Physical Work / Upper Management Does Not Care About Employees,"I loved the people I worked with on a daily basis and even promoted a few times.

Management is trained to act like they are better and more important then everyone who works there. They give it orders and act on the ""do as I say, not as I do"". Meaning they'll fire anyone who does something then they themselves will do that same thing! Also beginning January 14, 2023 management at all Walmarts now have the power to fire anyone they wish for any reason they feel like giving out.Very important to not make anyone upset with you because there's no job security, you can get fired for looking at someone the wrong way. Only way to stay at Walmart is to know a manager personally, or brown nose.Want a good place to work? Look somewhere else.

Over-Night Stocking,"A typical night stocking at Walmart usually went something like this at my store:We'd always start out the night with a meeting with all the other stockers team leads, and coaches. The team leads are typically the only ones who speak, and they go over problems they may have noticed from previous nights, any updates on procedure/policy, whether previous nights have been up to standards, how many truck loads for the shift, and anyone who may need to stay over until the meeting is over. Typically meetings start ten minutes after the shift starts (yes you do get paid and can clock-in nine mins. early too) or when everyone is there, and last no more than 3-5mins. At the end a team lead will assign you to an area and task to start for the night. Depending on the workload planned out for you, you could be there for the entire shift or may more around the entire night.When you start it seems that you will be assigned to work in different areas frequently, so it does make it difficult to get adjusted to one part of the store at a time. Also the part of the store you're located in will generally make a difference for how much you are able to complete. Most team leads/coaches do awknowledge that some areas (chemicals, pets, dairy/frozen, ect.) can be more challenging than others (paper goods, toys, cosmetics). There are meant to be different standards for the minimum would should be able to get done in one shift. At times there can be management who are not as considerate of this, and will keep pushing you no matter how much you get done or how high your productivity is.The night - more...",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"New Boston, OH",5/10/23,2023,5,10

Mentally draining,When I started it was really slow and had areas of the store with little freight. Then my first solo night they moved me to a section with multiple pallets with 4 hours and to then help other associates who had less than me. Now getting coaching's for slow productivity even though I'm moved to newer areas everyday.,1,Current Employee,Stocker ,North Carolina,5/9/23,2023,5,9

Good and bad points,"I really like being a cashier and working with all of the customers. But, I don't like the management. They do not care about their workers. They don't listen to them, and they degrade them. We never hear a thank you, just bad things.Employee morale is poor and people are quitting right and left. I would not recommend this place for work for anyone. Also, there is a strict attendance policy. If you have more than 3.5 points, then you loose your hours.They don't take doctors excuses either. Hard place to work!!!!My advice: keep looking, just not here!!!!",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Auburn, IN",5/9/23,2023,5,9

Alright place…,"This place would not be that bad of a place to work for if the management wasn’t so bad. Some of the employees can be tolerable, but the management is not great. Managers will talk behind your back or talk about you to others in front of you. They will talk all they want but you talk for a minute and you get in trouble. They expect you to do lame tasks that aren’t always part of your job role. There are also way too many managers, I understand Wal-Mart is a big store or can be, but it doesn’t need over 10 managers. Also, having a 9 hour work day and an hour lunch is lame.",2,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Clifton Park, NY",5/9/23,2023,5,9
A Simple Occupation for Simple People,"The pay is worth the work. All you do is check receipts, zone, open protected doors and such.

Management was awful,"Working there was an over-all pleasure, customers were nice and my co-workers were all very friendly.

Honestly horrible ,"Walmart was tough to work for. Even when you complete your tasks and go above and beyond, management makes you feel like you could have done more. They expect miracles to happen in regards to task completion and and workload, even though they are severely understaffed. They enact a points system to track attendance and don't hold everybody to the same standards. Ex: fire one associate for hitting 5 points, but continually erase points for other associates. I really loved my job, my coworkers, and the customers,  but the management and upper management were very difficult to deal with and very unrealistic. If you can help it, just go with another company, avoid the famous ""Walmart  drama""",1,Former Employee,Deli/Bakery Associate ,"East Windsor, CT",5/9/23,2023,5,9

You can only look out for yourself because management don’t have your best interest at heart , even though they say they do.",1,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Canton, MS",5/9/23,2023,5,9
Awful management ,I know every store is different but it sounds like most are the same. Management told us every night how they wish to just fire us over and over again. Constantly yelled out for not doing enough even when super understaffed. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. ,1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Ogden, UT",5/9/23,2023,5,9
"Pay is good, treatment is terrible",Work here if you have no self respect. Pay is the same all throughout the warehouse despite the difference in job function. Managers don't care about employee satisfaction although they'll say they do. Pays higher than most warehouses but at the cost of your sanity.,2,Current Employee,Trainer ,"Pedricktown, NJ",5/9/23,2023,5,9

Previously I worked,"I worked at Walmart for a few years and had a mixed experience. On the positive side, the company has a strong emphasis on customer service and employee training, which was helpful for me as a new hire. Additionally, the company offers a wide range of benefits, including health insurance and employee discounts, which are definitely a plus.On the negative side, I found the workload to be quite demanding, especially during busy periods like holidays. The pace was fast and it was often difficult to keep up, which could be stressful at times. Additionally, the work environment could be quite chaotic and disorganized, which made it challenging to stay focused and efficient.Overall, I think Walmart can be a good place to work for people who enjoy a fast-paced, customer-oriented environment and are willing to put in the effort to keep up with the demands of the job. However, it may not be the best fit for everyone, and those who prefer a more structured or low-stress work environment may want to consider other options.",3,Former Employee,CSS ,"Powhatan County, VA",5/9/23,2023,5,9

Hours ,"It is a fine position, they offer good benefits and pay. The only issue is hour cuts, do not hire people who you only plan to give 5 hours a week to, the argument is that they are part time but if this was the issue Walmart should not be promoting flexible schedules, there is nothing flexible about having only 5 hours for 2 weeks.

Horrible place and leadership ,"They literally just hire a ton of people over the phone with no interviews. Most of the training is on the computer. They will barely give you much hands on training. I would come in to work everyday not knowing what stupid tasks they would give me. All handheld equipment and carts were usually tied up when I started my shift. Worst of all, your “leads” have attitudes! When you try to keep yourself busy when there is downtime, you’ll get yelled at cause you do something another lead tells you to do when it does get slow. Then when you wait for directions for what task to do next you’re quickly dismissed with smart remarks. Unless you need Walmart to pay your tuition, Look somewhere else. Most co workers were nice, leadership was one of the worst I ever seen.",1,Former Employee,Digital Personal Shopper ,"Willow Grove, PA",5/8/23,2023,5,8

"Very stressful, do not recommend ","If you want to be stressed out almost everyday  of the week and have to fight for your position, this is the job for you. The management is ridiculous, they will twist your words and make you feel dumb at times. The tasks they require you to do will take up most of your day just for another manager to make you redo what you’ve just done. I had hope for this job at first, going in hopeful and ready to only lasting 6 months due to their ridiculous demands and rudeness. Overall do not recommend this job to just anyone. ",2,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Plainview, TX",5/8/23,2023,5,8
Nothing good ,They over pay the new hire. While the older workers has to pull there work load plus there's. Making about what the new hire start out pay.

A decent job,"Overall not a bad first job. The pay is above minimum wage with no experience needed.

That happened a LOT.",4,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Grundy, VA",5/8/23,2023,5,8
Management was not supportive and company often retaliated ,"Their policies on when you are required to work were terrible, if you couldn't work a weekend day your next week would be cut short out of retaliation. I ultimately left because they cut my hours with no warning and my manager offered 0 support and made everyone's day miserable. To be full time you need to work 9 hour shifts (unpaid 1 hr. lunch) and work a day during the weekend, which means for terrible work life balance.",2,Former Employee,Cashier and Customer Service ,"Pella, IA",5/8/23,2023,5,8
Wouldn't recommend ,"Wouldn't recommend. Not a good atmosphere to work in. A lot of favoritism, pick me environment. And retaliation on employees when bringing issues to management. Also had ethical problems not diverse. ",1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Greer, SC",5/8/23,2023,5,8
An Unorganized Mess,"I applied to work for the night shift stocker and it was the most unorganized job I've ever had.

",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Maumelle, AR",5/8/23,2023,5,8
Long hours and radical schedule changes ,"My time at Walmart was great at first, thought I could “make a difference” in other associates jobs and lives. That’s me just talking to myself in my own head. There is so much work left over from 2 other shifts that I was constantly fighting to get the store ready for the next days business. If you don’t work during your dinner break you definitely won’t get done. There’s constant deliveries and vendors to attend to. You hope you have enough people to show up at the right times during your shift to get all the tasks done. My shift started at 8 PM and ONLY ENDED once the manager was satisfied with you leaving which is somewhere between 9:30 AM and noon the next day then you come back at 8 PM and do it all over again. I didn’t have weekends or any holidays off. So if you want to work 70-80 hours a week, walk about 15 miles a night, have no possibility of promotion because you are the work horse that constantly gets reprimanded for the tiniest things and needs a manager that can hold you till you are told you can go home like a kindergartener then this is the job for you!

Associate ,I love working there the first 10 years and when family quit running what Sam believe it went down here associate are just bodies they don't care about their employees  it's just get it done and no matter what the customer is always right that doesn't always true customer know if they want something bad enough just throw a fit and they will get their way manager don't stand with what is right and behind their employees ,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Sevierville, TN",5/8/23,2023,5,8

Needs to pay more money to overnight staff/ stock workers,Walmart does not pay enough.  The pay to employees needs to fit the description.

They are the heartbeat of the store.,1,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Team Lead ,"Sykesville, MD",5/8/23,2023,5,8
Horrible Management,"If you like being pushed around by people in higher positions, then this is the job for you. Favoritism is a huge problem with this company.

"Decent work, horrible management ","I moved here from the warehouse for more hours, I wish I would have stayed at the DC.

The Definition of Chaos in a Nutshell ,Working at work Walmart feels like you are a tourist in the safari. Is the best way I can compare it  during the busiest hours from my experience. Walmart looks like they have really good benefits but trying to find out from the managers is like looking Waldo. The pay is decent at Walmart but the work environment is on a whole different spectrum I can’t even comprehend. You will be stressed out with their point system if you clock in pass the grace period or clocking out early by accident and none of the managers don’t even bother assisting you to correct it. Working on the sale floor is more preferable than front end. ,1,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Secaucus, NJ",5/8/23,2023,5,8

I had an open door and that higher manager went and told the manager I had an open door about that I complained about him and his way of being a manager. There’s no confidentiality. There’s no hours we get sent home early everyday after 3 or 4 hours of work. Total hours a week are 12 at times. How can someone survive with that pay! It’s ridiculous. I’ve applied for various promotional positions but since I had an open door policy, no other department wants me because they want people that are robots and do as they say and people that don’t ever speak up against management even when management is wrong.

Terrible Management. They do not value their employees ,This is the worst place I have ever worked in my life. They treat you like you are a child and management is very disrespectful to employees.

Only apply if its the only option,"The store management here is laughable, you are more likely to be fired if you don't straighten up an aisle compared to getting the actual job finished. If you are on the 3rd shift, you will be overworked most nights, get ridiculed if you need to leave early, and have a fraction of a chance of getting any PTO request approved. This store will hire anyone with a pulse and just brush off any harassment that happens no matter what the employees do about it. If you do end up working here, just know that if management says ""get done what you can"" for a department, it translates to  ""halfway through the night we will be panicking because you didn't get a job done that requires at least 3 people"". My advice would be to explore your opportunities for other jobs before applying here.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Greenville, OH",5/7/23,2023,5,7
Horrible Workplace,This Walmart is a horrible place to work at. I've only been here for like 2 weeks and team leads and coaches are already yelling at me and not following Walmart policy and ignoring Walmart policies.

I had this happen to me and when I told them I had a second job that I work on my off days they said “lots of people have second jobs, we don’t make accommodations for that”.     They will move you to a new area and promise you that it won’t affect your time in seat (which is how you become eligible for promotions) but it will actually start your time in seat over.

Terrible communication and training.,First 2 weeks were pretty smooth and regular… Until they forgot I was a new employee and expected me to know how to do things as if I worked at Walmart before. Not a single associate I had liked my coach including my team lead so from the start there wasn’t much room for hospitality. After about the first month everyday I came in I couldn’t actually  get to do my job for half of my shift because we never had enough scanners so I had to find another task in another department to work on until someone went on lunch.

It's a good place for a first job or to just get your foot through the door but there is some down sides,"I actually liked working at walmart. It wasn't hard, pretty easy (except weekends). Overall it was a really good job. But there were some downside to working there. Down sides are the points system and work/life balance. If you missed days, you would get a point. Even if you called in sick or even at the event of an emergency, you will still get a point. Get 5 points and you will be fired. They also gotten more strict with listening to music or talking for a period of time with anyone. The Work life balance is rough when full time. Hard to get a mix of work and life. You will usually work more than be at home. I wish i had a 10 hour shift and get three days off but they did not offer that.

It's Walmart. The reputation precedes itself.,"The favoritism and nepotism is not hidden. 3/4 of the staff at my store are all friends with each other or related to one another. Lots of people getting management to hire their friends, family, whoever. When people are terrible at their job they drag their feet on getting rid of them. Expect to take on 2 to 3x normal work load if you have a lazy or bad employee working with you. Coworkers can stand around and talk, sit down and not do work, go on ridiculously long breaks over their allotted time, etc. Eventually I started having to do shifts alone when our area is meant to have 3 people. 1 person doing the job of 3 people and only getting paid as 1, for a s h i t wage for the work load. Academy Trainers many times don't even know all the ins and outs of their job and make you go to old managers or old coworkers to ask questions if they don't know how to do something or you need to learn how to do something.

Retaliation is a thing,"Management sticks with management here. Walmart preaches no retaliation, but there's retaliation and if you report it, all it does it makes it worse.

If you made under 18 at HO you were bumped up for cost of living, but those of us that made over that didn't get anything and are struggling just the same.

But most don’t do their job properly and prey on the people under them I can see why I’ve had so many different managers in such a short time.

Health and Wellness Division very poorly managed,"Walmart is no longer interested in hiring or keeping qualified workers. Lowest pay in the industry (both pharmacist and technician), some benefits are better than others in the industry. Typical Walmart employment is get hired, receive minimal training and then get thrown to the wolves. Constant staffing cuts in pharmacy and vision mean you can't actually train or be trained. Everyone above store level sits around and brainstorms ways to make store employees' lives miserable. Zero support from corporate on anything. Managers are simply there to serve as scapegoats if profits decrease by even 1%. Corporate not interested in pharmacy patient care/safety, only interested in profits and don't care if patients get hurt or not.

This seems to lead to many mistakes that hinder productivity down the line. -Turnover rate is high, not many people seem to stay long-term, a good chunk dip in and just disappear after a while -Can't really tell if pay is good or not, it seems inconsistent between employees even on the same shift from some discussions I've had with people who have been here about the same amount of time as me, and some make more for similar work and some make less-Management can be irritating at times, occasional sarcasm at your expense, doesn't seem to understand or doesn't care that the workload is more than you can handle at times and likes to give sarcastic answers to genuine questions more often than is preferable, they do however seem to take things like injuries very seriously-Recently 3rd shift has been getting extra tasks dumped on them under the guise of helping us hit our hours, not sure how the logic on that one works-Coworkers are good people for the most part.

Too many issues to list,"My biggest issue is the pay. They want to be competitive but instead of giving everyone a raise on top of what they already made.. they gave everyone the same pay so it wouldn’t matter if you worked here for 10 years or 1 day. There’s no growth in this company. If you aren’t willing to work 10 hour days to be a team lead, you’ll always just be a basic employee and never get anywhere with this company. Also, schedules are never correct and the point system is just dumb. If you don’t work full time you don’t get PTO either, only PPTO.

Good for younger person,It is a physically exhaustive job but if you’re a young kid or physically fit person the job should be pretty easy….you are on your own and don’t have to deal with managers breathing down your neck at all times…..low hours is the worst thing….overall good place to work as long as there is enough hours,3,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Wintersville, OH",5/1/23,2023,5,1
