Constant restructuring,"Worked here for 13 years,  I feel trapped that is why I stay.  The only thing consistent is the inconsistency.

New employment,I really enjoy working with the people I work with. Some of the department managers can be hard to get along with or talk to the other associates with inappropriate attitudes. Since only two people at our store are allowed to change schedule issues or grant request off its also a hassle.

Not Worth It,"A high workload and demand is placed upon you while they pay you very little and give you no appreciation for the work you do. The only way to get promoted here is not by doing your job and being good at it but to make sure you are managements favorite, so if you are someone who treats the job as a job and just gets things done don't expect to move up here, if you are someone who likes to talk to the boss and make them your friend then you will be all set.

Sucks,Worst place to work for.  The rumors are true.  Terrible atmosphere to work in.  Assistant-store manager were idiots.  Gave out our scarce supplies to other stores without realizing that we were also running low.  Depart managers didn’t know how to run their departments themselves.  One didn’t know how to make sandwiches nor use oven In the deli.  One barely showed up.  Another didn’t know what duties they were required to do by themselves.  All relied on lower non-managers employees to do their duties.  Procedures from the corporate office was ignored.  Attendance policies were ignored.  Medical restrictions from employees’ doctors were ignored.  Safety for employees were ignored.  Really depressing place to work in.  Stay away.,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Diamond Bar, CA",11/17/19,2019,11,17

Bad Work Experience,"At first Walmart was great but the pay is not enough to live off of. They do not advance pay or tittle, or compensate for there employees.

It's a great place to start out in the retail industry.,"I mostly enjoyed working at Walmart. It has it's pros and cons, but overall it is a good place to work. It can be stressful and demanding too at times. So getting used to your working environment is important. And also working with your supervisors, shift leads, and coworkers. You can work independently and also as a team. But getting along with others is crucial. As well as helping out customers whether it's in the electronics dept. or sporting goods or automotive or grocery depts. If you work in the frozen dept, you need to be able to handle 30 degree freezing temperatures and that dept. is one of the most demanding of all from my experience.

The pros and cons,"Some of the  managers are so nitpicky and  overly critical, even some of them are more reasonable.  They assume that everyone there is an illiterate idiot. One of them just gets bored and screws around with decent employees. If it was more busy they would be too preoccupied  with other tasks. I assume that running a grocery store is tough._x000D_The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers especially the customers. And you will lose weight from the strenuous activity of the role of the stocker. There are plenty of hours to offer a GM Stocker._x000D_The associates are generally okay except when it comes towards the end of the day some people get pretty cantankerous. They act like they are the managers. _x000D_The corporation changed their attendance  policy last February 2019 .

Quality of life is poor.,"Long hours, great pay, expect to work excessive hours without a thank you or good job. Treat people like they are disposable.

Great Managers and people surrounding you,"WalMart pushes its employees to cover multiple jobs because they cut out those other jobs in order to pay you more. They pay very fairly, and you get two 15 minute paid breaks and an hour unpaid break, and you can accrue pto and ppto in case you have to call out. The hardest part of the job is getting the job done in the time allotted because they'll have one person doing five people's jobs.

Top of the retail food chain.,Extremely fast paced at salary management level. Wal-Mart is at least 5 years ahead of all other brick and mortar retailers. The good - extremely structured and everyone is given the resources to succeed. The bad - highly political environment where long term success is based upon who you align yourself with. Everyone will need to pull out a “lifeline” at some point to save yourself. Also Wal-Mart is so large that you are just another employee who is easily replaced.,4,Former Employee,Store Director ,"Bentonville, AR",11/15/19,2019,11,15

The best culture worldwide,Walmart is a work place where it feels like family . The culture from the interview from actually getting hired is a great feeling .

"Overall a great place to work, my only concern is a low pay","Genuinely enjoy working here! there's a fast pace environment that may seem difficult to keep up with, however, you have a great team to back you up when the department falls behind. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the customer flow, sometimes there are very few dispensers that have to take care of 10+ customers at once, while other times there will be zero customers waiting on us. The only downside, in my opinion, is the wage. I wouldn't expect 100k/year, but making only 13.45$/hour is difficult to survive on, especially in such an expensive area of Colorado, if you plan on not working very much overtime or taking extra shifts, you can expect not being able to afford rent in any of the nearby apartments.",4,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Parker, CO",11/15/19,2019,11,15

"Productive and fun place to work, but also slacked in team work","Walking into Walmart as a costumer is a normal thing. Walking in as an associate you have more things to look for and observe. Management for one was pretty good. Having a good supervisor and manager, but the team work was just not all there. You would help your group out, but would get told to go do your job even when another associate is asking for it. Walmart is a team company. Paying and benefits were acceptable. The one thing I will say is if your a team your a team, work as a team, sale as a team, help like a team. I would say the most enjoyable part of fresh cap was helping around the deli and bakery and the backroom when things needed to be moved.

Don’t do it if you don’t have to!,"Been working for Walmart almost 4 years now and I haven’t the slightest idea how anyone’s stayed an associate for over that amount of time. Their practices are unfair to their regular associates, I haven’t met a single manager who actually goes “by the book”. And even if you’re full time you’re really part time. I’ve worked at one specific store but have had the opportunity of filling in at different stores  to help out and they ALL run their stores the same. Went on maternity leave and they gave my position away and no one answers the phones (Team Leads are never in their office) at the stores to get in contact with HR (Team Lead). I have a four month old I can’t support because of managements incompetence. Tried to transfer to a different store but it’s been almost 2 months since I’ve been trying to come back and they’re giving me the run around because I’m full time and they’re cutting a lot of hours AND positions.",2,Current Employee,Cashier/ Frozen Manager/ E-Commerce Associate ,"Houston, TX",11/14/19,2019,11,14

Started Out Fine but Became Terrible,"When I first working here, I was hard working, content with the job, though perhaps wanted a bit more pay. This was the second time I worked for this company and I had left on good terms from the last position to focus on schooling for a few months. After working in this position for about a week, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and her health was failing after a few months. I was depressed and as a result, I missed more days of work than I should have. I didn't want to do a job when I couldn't give 100%. When I told a manager about this, I was told to ""get over it"" for work and sent out to the floor. I stopped caring at this point. I missed even more days. I  always made sure to let them know if I would bot be there. When they did fire me, I only found out because I had been removed from the schedule and my discount card declined. Tried to go in and talk with them about it. They were always conveniently on lunch or off that day in HR. To this day,I still have yet to even get an email about my termination.

Good points and bad points,Working at Walmart has its good points and bad points. The company itself is okay to work for but I feel as though management cares more about making money than it does about its employees or its customers.

C.Y.A. and brown nose,"The store manager likes to pit the department managers against each other just to see what would happen. If you don't keep carefully documented notes of what you did, when, how long it took you and why it took you that long you could potentially find yourself in a writeup that you only vaguely remember the details so you are unable to defend yourself adequately. The basic structure and ideas are great but the Walmarts around here are all about brown-nosing and making sure that you stay on the good side of certain managers otherwise you could find yourself on the chopping block. It was not uncommon for the store I worked at to lose about 3-6 department managers a year most of them leaving or getting terminated around January - March. As long as you keep your head down and do the expected work without trying to do too much more, then you stand a chance at having a good time there without a bullseye on your back but once you step into a leadership or training position remember to always, C.Y.A.",1,Former Employee,Everything ,"Idaho Falls, ID",11/12/19,2019,11,12

Mentally and Physically Draining,"This job is by far the worst place I have worked for, including fast food. The management is ridiculous, there are assistant managers who act like the cool kids in high school and it’s rather disappointing. The hardest workers get work loads dropped on them and are constantly harassed. While slackers are overlooked. This job is physically and mentally exhausting. I do not recommend if you suffer from behavioral health issues. As a supervisor over the online grocery department, that is by far the worst part of the Walmart franchise. There is no care in the world and it is treated as a second business. If you work only for the money you’ll be alright. However, if you’re looking for a job to advance your experience. Look else where, Walmart is filled with favoritism, neglect and disorganization.",1,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Manchester, CT",11/12/19,2019,11,12

Would advise people to stay away from this place,Walmart has to many associates wanting to be the boss and not enough workers for the amount of bosses. The training was non existent especially when it came time to use the inventory scanner equipment if you ask a question they get you to the area of the scanner that you need to do the task instead of taking the time to explain how to use the inventory equipment.

Fairly Easy,"Most jobs are pretty easy from what I see. It is very stressful at times though because the managers aren't always available and sometimes the store manager or assistant manager will tell you to do something a certain way while your department manager tells you to do it another way.

Cashier,Working at Walmart was cool. You definitely got to be use to being on your feet for long hours. They gave two 15 minute breaks and depending on how long you worked that day rather it was 7 hours or less you got a 30 minute lunch and if you worked 8 plus hours than you received a hour lunch break.

There was some issues with the paper work and I tried explaining that to my Up front  Coach  and he wasn't willing to listen. My up front coach only cared about one thing and I will not repeat it because I'm sure I would get in trouble. I was a CSM I would come in and work double shifts if they needed me but for some reason they always get rid of the employees that wanna work. I wouldn't recommend any one to work for Walmart.

Used to be a good company,"I currently came back to Walmart after walking away a couple of years ago. When I needed a job again without the travel of my last job, I jumped at the chance to go back to Walmart. When I was with Walmart before, it was a great working experience. Now though, it has become a micromanaging company. All of the salaried management team is only there to better themselves, and they do not work as a cohesive unit. It does not matter how hard you work, or the speed you work at, everything you do here is wrong now. I honestly don't know what changes in a couple of years to make this company great to work for into what it has become today.",1,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Clovis, CA",11/9/19,2019,11,9

"Political, poor work life balance, poor culture, poor management. Good benefits/pay","You give an inch, they will take a mile. Management is hit or miss, and bad management isn’t dealt with by corporate. Toxic environment and low morale. No work/life balance. You will live there as a salaried manager.

Fast Paced Environment,You’ll have max 5 occurrences and PTO you could use on your occurrence. As a stocker I had to hurry and finish with all pallets and carts if not finish I would have to tell the support manager.

Fast paced,This is a competitive work place that does not always provide the associates with the resources needed to complete daily tasks.

Walmart,"Overall, I am grateful for the experience and the opportunity, but as the years went on management continuously got worse.

Not a job for experienced Loss Prevention Individuals,I have many years of experience in the Loss Prevention field.  I have never had a bad stop until working for this company.  There are too many gray areas in their AP policies that managment can misconstrue and use against an individual.  They are not open to new ideas and Management are like programmed robots.  They are too write up happy with the associates and wonder why people call in and they are shorthanded every day.  Peole do not like their jobs and management  just cant figure this out.  How about a little development instead of discipline......always dicipline. The store management was helpful overall and the associates were friendly and willing to help when I asked.  The job is all floor surveillance even though they have cameras that are only used for review and to burn a disc for evidence.  The hours are terrible eating up the middle of your day every day you are scheduled making it difficult to find another job for extra income.  It feels like the AP Managers have a very tight collar on you making it hard to get the apprehens that they want you to get a month.

Decent Job,"My time working with Walmart began very very very happily those slowly over time it's degenerated into a monotonous and bitter experience. this cannot be applied as all the compassing to Walmart because my position was security more specifically customer host which means for the majority of my shifts I would stand at the front doors and check receipts therefore I was cussed at and berated by people constantly on a daily basis ignored them anymore and that was a cause for much of my bitterness. as with any and every job there are good managers and there are bad I have the experience of both multiple times working there Walmart can really only truly be rated on a store by store, distribution center buy distribution center, and corporate office locations - I don't think it is fair possible to give an all-encompassing review of all of Walmart based off of my experience and a few stores I was at so I will be honest and fair. I did leave this job for higher pay though and my pay was cut when I was wrongfully removed from the pharmacy due to discrimination, but the closeness to my house the familiarity with the community and the general more flexibility and greater job security and my position was enough for me to stay",3,Former Employee,AP Customer Host ,"Frankfort, KY",11/8/19,2019,11,8

The training isn't that good either, I had one associate that showed me what to do, to stock the shelves. Not hard at all, just expect you to be fast all the time. The backroom like unloading the trucks you have to be fast pace for a whole 2hrs and 30 minutes of the duration. No breaks. First time doing it they didn't show me how it was done and so I was confuse out of my mind. But, once they showed me it isn't that hard; just labor.

poor management and stressful working conditions,When I go in for work I do not expect to feel unimportant and belittled by workers and especially management.

So many struggles,As a asst manager your pride and pleasure in your job comes from your store manager. If he/she is a poor SM you will be miserable.

Walmart is a bad employer,"The culture of Walmart is one that on the surface seems to care about their employees but the reality is woefully different.   I was hired as a janitorial person on the night shift but I was immediately told to go work in the stocking department because they were short handed (inadequate staffing is a norm there...why? because they want to stay in a budget and also employees quit or call in sick frequently.   My manager had mental problems and he wanted me to blow the warehouse with a leaf blower and no doors open, so the place filled with dust.  I thought this was crazy but I had lost my voice and I couldn't complain that I had respiratory problems.   The training process was thorough and I really liked the lady.  The day shift seemed to be many assistant managers but when you needed a door unlocked in order to do your job, many times there were none available to help. You also had to adhere to a time frame for doing your job and it didn't matter if you were told to go take out groceries to a waiting car.  It meant you had to do a rush through in cleaning the restrooms and that usually means if you took time to clean something that really needed attention, you were told you were going to slow.  The store had a high incidence of theft and they would blame their door greeter instead of hiring adequate security personnel (there was one!! who would walk around the door and ""engaging"" with a potential shoplifter which meant ""greeting them"" and hoping that would deter them from walking out with something.

Very Fast Paced Work Environment.,"Spanaway Walmart is an ok place to work. It is very fast paced but retail can be very stressful. Sometimes the environment we experience in Spanaway, can be very dangerous. I do enjoy most of our daily customer's as most people in this world are good.

I decided to stay as a Customer Service Manager, but staying in the Accounting Office doing the same thing I had been doing. The new Title/Position offered me more money and I was happy to help my new Management Team learn the office they knew nothing about. I cared about my office and did not want to see it crumble. Customer Service Manager is a much more fast paced and stressful position. We are responsible for running the entire front end of the store.

terrible job!,I would never ever EVER recommend anyone to work at Walmart. they work you like Construction Works for $11.50/hr. they dint even have the decency to get a dishwasher so who knows how clean the dishes really are and how much bacteria is still left on the racks that hold raw rotisserie chickens. the employees gossips all day long and yell across the store to customers/employees; and take the chickens off before their timer. don’t always use gloves or clean the slicers daily. the manger is disgusting. she’s rude and talks to people like they’re her children.

Not a bad place to be.,"Spent 7 years at Walmart. Thanks to my direct supervisors being decent people, I was able to handle the job soundly. Like any workplace, there will always be individuals that employ questionable practices, but thanks to the systems Walmart has in place, these individuals can be reported to the right people. Long story short, you're unlikely to find managers that will outright break rules, since Walmart has low tolerance for those sorts of things, but that won't stop bad eggs from making their way into the system on rare occasion. Your mileage may vary.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Midland, MI",11/1/19,2019,11,1

They limited the allowable callouts which is understandable to a point, but insodoing they made it really impossible for parents to manage home lives and for people with health problems. They don't accept doctor's notes, so it's pointless to give one to them. I was given 3 raises, sure, but that was only because there was a state minimum wage raise and I switched to different store roles. Our service manager would leave in the middle of his shift for several hours at a time, leaving only two or three of us in the auto center to handle things on our own. He would make promises to customers knowing we couldn't fulfill them because of our policies and he wouldn't be there to handle the fallout. He treated all of us very poorly.

A job but not a career,"As a cashier, it can be very fast past especially on weekends. Employees have to run everything (such as breaks, lunch, canceling a transaction) through CSM's. You hardly get to go on breaks and lunch on time and will have to ask managers to go on breaks. If I didn't need the money so badly, I would've left a long time ago. Management will not work with your schedule unless you are a part timer. You will get benefits for both full and part time.HR will hire anyone and everyone You can advance quickly if you do your job. The easiest part of cashiering is ringing up items but the hardest part is that the register is so old that you don't have full access of what you are ringing up. Walmart needs to update their registers. CSM's need to learn about time management. Management need to cross train everyone in all areas.  Finally, there's not enough employees (or cashiers anyways) working at this location.

"Limited supervision, a few slackers, but overall great people","Enjoyed the position I had very much because of the limited supervision and the trust that was given. Unfortunately, due to slackers and buddy situations, I witnessed other people having to work harder since the boss played favorites and let her amigos come to work and do nothing but socialize and sleep. I'd work there again if I had to in spite of those points since they didn't really affect me. It is a shame that higher-ups haven't learned yet how to be good leaders and play fair. It sets a very bad example for new and upcoming leaders, to have to be under managers and supervisors that take advantage of hardworking people and teaching others that it is alright to do so, just don't get caught.

What have you done for me lately?,"When i began working for Wal-Mart, I was a fresh, 19 year old with no ""real"" job experience where punching a clock was necessary. I started in their meat department as an hourly associate making a little over minimum wage. After about 2 years of hard work and learning every chance i could, an opening for supervisor in the department became available. I interviewed and got the job and saw immediate success and turnaround of the department. There is so much room for growth and advancement, but management and superiors tend to throw their weight around. I have learned so much in my altogether 4 years, enough to last a lifetime. Being a team leader, a teacher, a mentor and role model is what i enjoy the most and what keeps me coming back with the same upbeat attitude every day of work. The culture is so unique from store to store and in my own it's one of a kind.

The Deli was absolutely disgusting!,"The only decent thing about working for Walmart was the relationships you build with some of the customers/ co-workers. However it wasn't with very many. The majority of Walmart was very much drama oriented and there was a lot of favoritism at play. Most were extremely lazy and would leave unfinished work for the next shift with absolutely no repercussions. There was no product rotation and on several occasions expired products were served to the customers. All the equipment was either covered in mold or like in the rotisserie over the racks had years of cooked on chicken on them. Completely unsanitary. Most who would purchase the premade sandwiches or chickens would end up with a slight case of diarrhea and well I hate to break it to you, but that is a case of food poisoning. I have advise everyone I know not to purchase anything from them. Better off going to publix and paying the extra in order to avoid getting sick or even worse!",1,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Largo, FL",10/31/19,2019,10,31

It's just a matter of time until it happens to your job code.  Many years with the company and I was laid off on a conference call with dozens of other people.  Just like that.  I spent years waiting for it to happen and watching it happen to others.  That's an awful way to live, waiting for the hammer to drop, at no fault of your own, just based on one of the continual reorganizations.

Working here was the worst experience of my life.,"I absolutely hated working here. If you have an issue with anything you have to bug the managers plenty of times before they help you. Anything you do goes unrecognized, and you can even get punishment for doing the right thing, for example when it’s busy and the manager tells you you’re not allowed to take a lunch, they give you a strike for it. You are definitely not compensated for the amount of times customers yell at you.

Fast paced work but horrible co-workers,"I had been trying to apply to the 6082 distribution center for 5yrs after getting out of the Army and I finally got a hold of someone in HR there and he specifically told me that IT DID NOT MATTER THAT I WAS A VETERAN even though they had all their commercials out saying that they always put veterans first and they were re-hiring people that they had fired multiple times before I would even get an interview.  Then I finally got a job there working as an order filler for the meat and produce section and I was immediately met with a hostile work environment.  As soon as I started one of the other employees was going to my supervisor telling him that I was leaving things screwed up in certain areas, after this went on for a couple weeks my supervisor finally decided to have me write down things that I noticed were messed up and the times and locations that they were messed up at so he could track who was actually doing it, the next week the worker that I thought had been the one that was causing the problems ""transferred"" and I was back to work.  Then some of the other guys decided they were going to start doing the exact same thing to me and I even over heard them gripping about me actually turning them in for it like I had to do with the other guy when I first started.  It has decent pay but if you aren't in the special little cliques that go on there will be nothing you can do and they will either make you get fired or you will have to resign.",2,Former Employee,order filler ,"Clarksville, AR",10/31/19,2019,10,31

If you are their ""pet"" you basically can walk around all day with air pods/earbuds in your ears all day and do nothing and nothing is said to you, but if management doesn't like you, you get all the work to do, work other departments and when your work isn't done, they want to hold you accountable.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"North Charleston, SC",10/30/19,2019,10,30

Each store is different,"I worked for Wal-mart for 5 years i loved working for that company and the positions that I did untill about a year ago.  Things change and when that happens things get crazy. Wal-mart hires associates for different positions and also has assistant managers divided up for certain parts of the store. Managers are never available in their departments, their always off somewhere else and when called for assistance requests are ignored. The only time the store is running the way it should be is when there is visits from regional managers and corporate, then madness occurs. In my opinion if you do your job right the first time and keep at it when regional and corporate managers come there wont be anything to worry about. Managers play favoritism and definitely have a favorite associate. There is an attendance policy but if your a favorite associate you will get multiple chances to correct your attendance issues. If your a hard worker, always on time and never really call in, be prepared to do your job and the job of several others for example if your a customer service supervisor (CSS) you have to cashier, be a self checkout host, work at customer service desk, get site to store orders for customers, work security at front door, be a cart associate, do maintenance and put away returns for every department all while running calls to cashiers at every register. They say there is an open door policy so that you can talk to the store manager about issues you might be having but if you do that and they do not like what you said there will be retaliation against your schedule and hours. - more...",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative/Cash Office ,"Denver, CO",10/30/19,2019,10,30

Never Work At Walmart.,"It was just as terrible as everyone says it is.

Walmart is a very sressful place,Walmart could be a great place to work if corporate understood the people they service. Managers need to be more hands on and not be on a power trip. Stop letting computers run the business. People do have families they lives does not revolve around Walmart so they need a set schedule. Walmart is a billion dollar company and they pay the employee pennies. The turn over is so unreal. the few people that stays only stay because a piece of a job is better than no job at all.,1,Former Employee,Money Center Associate ,"St. Louis, MO",10/29/19,2019,10,29

Productive Workplace with reasonable breaks.,"Typical days were simple, going to meet as a group, going to assigned locations, assisting customers. Learned many simple work ethics and basic mechanisms. Workplace culture seemed non-existent, with management only talking about how it needs to happen.

Great Atmosphere,Co-workers are very nice when I ask for help and work days are usually pretty smooth sailing. I've learned to properly take care of packages when you remove them from the trucks.

You have to be able to be able to be versatile.,4,Former Employee,Maintenance Worker ,"Chicago, IL",10/29/19,2019,10,29
"Terrible Management, Low Pay, little room for advancement.","Management has always been awful since day one. I only had two to three managers I enjoyed working with. They don’t praise hard work, they just give the best workers more to do and let the lazy ones slack off with no repercussion. They always took people from out of store for open positions in which a current, more qualified employee could’ve advanced to. They also did not let overnight associates switch to a day time position to possibly further their career in the store, but let day time associates switch around left and right. This in turn left a lot of employees the only option but to leave for a better paying job all together. They threw people out if they weren’t a good positional fit in which they could have tried moving them around to find a good fit. No action was ever taken when someone was told of a thief in the store, and my last manager left the building multiple times a night to smoke cigarettes, which breached company policy of the 2 mandatory 15 minute breaks, and the hour unpaid lunch break. They’re supposed to be setting an example",1,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance Associate ,"Meadville, PA",10/29/19,2019,10,29

This job sucks the life out of you,Worked as a customer service supervisor for 6 months and I almost wanted to kill myself because I was doing everything by myself at the closing end 4pm-11pm with a good for nothing co partner that would go outside and push carts. Management did not care at all. I got barely a 30 minute lunch cause it was required and that was it. No other breaks and when I got back it was always a mess.

Productive,"If I would've had a better management team or working at a bigger store, I would've had a way better experience working there. It was a small store so we had to unload the truck sometimes two and then stock it. Employees at other stores say they either unload or stock not both, but that wasn't a problem. If management wouldn't have been giving us a hard time as if work wasn't getting done fast enough, even though we're doing a two-man job in one shift. It was just overbearing and stressful and I couldn't handle it, but under better circumstances I would work there again.",3,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Many, LA",10/29/19,2019,10,29

Then when those managers left and new ones came in they changed it back and i complained i hadn't had a weekend off in over 4 months and they did nothing to help, just tokd me that management has to do it...so i should have no problem doing it.

Stressful and the people behind desks don’t care as long as they get their bonus checks for our hard work,"Walmart used to be an okay place to work at but everything started going downhill about a year ago. Our current manager left (which isn’t the company’s fault) but she was just the most warm kind manager I’ve ever had! They didn’t get us a new manager until after about 3 months. Our new manager has been with Walmart for 3 (?) years but they don’t know how to do ANYTHING. Managers are supposed to be leaders but often we find ourselves teaching our boss how to do simple tasks in our pharmacy. She does not have any leadership qualities. We as a team have contacted our regional manager multiple times but nothing changes. Our pharmacy used to be great, always having prescriptions ready but then in June they “displaced” 3 of our techs and sent them to work in online grocery. Now we have so many things with as little as 3 techs per day and they make the pharmacists work alone all day from 9a-9p with only 30 minutes to eat, and that’s only if we can shut down in time. I’ve been trying to leave for months and I am finally about to get a new job.  There’s so much more but I’ll leave it at that.",1,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Somewhere, OK",10/28/19,2019,10,28

Its jus a job,I really think Walmart is a bad company they really don't care how they treat they're employees. The employees that do there job they make sure they use them until they are used up and then they use them some more if they are able to. The employees that dont put forth the effort in they're job and task dont get held accountable and the workers that they used get used some more to clean up or fix what the other employees didn't do.

Fair but not a great place to work.,"As a new hire the expectations placed on me seemed a bit high, wages are barely enough to live on, and you get paid biweekly so by the time you get paid again you’ve been struggling for a week. You only get 4 sick days (unpaid) every 6 months, and you only get a 25 cent raise every year. If you miss a shift without calling in they count it as all 4 against you and terminate your employment immediately, however they are willing to work with you in certain instances. You do get paid time off as long as you work there over 6 months, but it’s cumulative so you have to work more to get more. Considering that they will only work you 4 days per week and won’t allow overtime, it’s hard to get the money you need and the paid time off you deserve. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re a high school student without typical financial responsibilities.",2,Former Employee,3rd Shift Stocker ,"Boiling Springs, SC",10/28/19,2019,10,28

Management was easy to talk to and very understanding about things. I was glad to have such a great supervisor. The workplace is very fast paced and a bit stressful. The coworkers are great and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with 3 trucks at one time while at the same time making sure to not lag behind.

Every Walmart store is different and a prospective employee should be aware customer service is a priority with Walmart.,"I actually loved my job there. I also have a very positive outlook and love working in retail. I was a favorite and part of upper hourly management which made my experience different than your typical hourly associate. I am also very good at helping irritate customers. My ratings are based on what I saw happeneing to other associates and how they were be tested by biased salaried management. Salaried management plays favorites (this is a common complaint I hear at many stores). Two associates of equal skills and drive can be treated completely opposite. I have even seen highly skilled and amazing associates fired or treated bad if a manager’s favorite dislikes or feels threatened by that fantastic associate...even though they were equals and there shouldn’t have been any fear or threat felt. If you are bubbly and optimistic or just good at playing the game you will do fine and might even thrive at Walmart. _x000D__x000D_The other thing that is a common complaint is the customers. Most are decent or amazing , but you will find your share of self entitled and angry customers. Associates are degraded and talked down to by these sort of customers. The best advice I could give you with those customers is to always remember, no matter what the custom may actually be saying, it isn’t personal and there is usually another underlying reason for their anger. Do not take it personally and try to let it go. I am not justifying their lack of respect to another human being, just that you shouldn’t let them bring you down...don’t sink to their level and do not let them make you angry.

Walmart review,Walmart has not been the best working environment. Management was always too preoccupied to help with associate concerns.

it is an okay job.,"Walmart is a decent place for high schoolers, but not seniors already in the work force. Walmart doesn’t have opportunity. They don’t give enough leniency for call our days though. My friend has no place to live currently and is taking care of her mother in the hospital. She is their only source of income and she had to call out multiple days and she got fired. I do not respect the policy like that at Walmart. It was very unfair to her for her situation.

"Overall, WalMart is a typical retail establishment to work for.","As with most retail positions, most employees are part-time, with number of assigned work hours being inconsistent, making it difficult to have multiple jobs, which is a requirement just to make ends meet. Hours can be reduced without notice, while this is convenient to meet the WalMart bottom line, it does not help employees who have bills to pay. Unfortunately, rent does not decrease when hours do.

It would be 0 stars if I could.,"I can't even express how horrible this place was to work. Easily the worst job I've ever had. Management was horrible, there were only 2 decent managers, one of whom stepped down from assistant manager and everything went down hill from there. The lady who took her place was the laziest excuse for an employee I've ever known. She was absolutely horrendous at scheduling (all the old ladies worked 7-4, and there were only 3 people on any given day to cover the front end, one person at each self check out, one on a single register). I was usually the only person watching the bigger self-checkout, 13 registers in total I think, at 4pm. All the alcoholics and middle-aged women pretending they're not alcoholics were buying alcohol at that time, usually almost every single register was taken, and I was supposed to help every single person all at once who then became angry at ME like it was my fault that woman is a moron and couldn't schedule reasonably. It wouldn't have been a problem if they had understood that people have lives and health issues and other important things going on outside of work and not fired everybody decent, which then forced everyone else decent to quit. This was all happening when the Scan and Go stuff started and customers were livid and yelling at us because we were doing what we were told to do, to get them to use self-checkout. We were even told to scan their items for them to make it look like self check out was being used, absolutely ridiculous, and the customers still bit our heads off for it.

The third part they go through for FMLA leave is difficult to deal with and does not always approve leave and if they do, they do no approve full leave. I had gall bladder surgery, I was approved for all but the 3 days before I went into the hospital. I almost lost my job as a result at that time. They do not follow their own policies. Cashier's only have to lift 25 pounds. A customer put a 40 pound bag of dog food on the belt. When I asked them to put it back in their cart, the customer complained and I was wrote up.

I've heard about management refusing to give employees enough hours to qualify, but I myself never had that issue. _x000D__x000D_Now, for the negatives. There are so many individual issues that I can't list them all here, but I'll broadly go over the more severe ones:_x000D__x000D_First, the ""One Best Way"". This is the document that governs work standards, and you can already tell by the name how frustratingly obtuse it is. Not only does it contain numerous grammatical, logical, and formatting errors, but certain procedures it adamantly enforces are blatantly inefficient. _x000D__x000D_Second, management. Whether a given manager would enforce a specific policy (such as whether we could listen to music in the back room) was essentially a coin toss. I was repeatedly accosted by multiple managers for various things I had obtained explicit permission from several other managers to do. _x000D__x000D_Third, and by far the most frustrating, were the arbitrary, detrimental decisions corporate made. For example, in early 2018, a new policy called ""Customer First Scheduling"" was implemented. Instead of regular work hours and days (which my department needed, as workflow was generally consistent), the scheduling system would dole out specific, largely arbitrary shifts depending on expected foot traffic. This destroyed any consistency in everyone's schedules (which forced one of the department's few employees to quit as they needed to care for an elderly parent), and generally made my job more difficult.

Its like highschool all over again,Constantly filled with drama and politics. None of the other workers were willing to work. Would often high in the bathroom. Holding it up for people who actually had to use the bathroom. Management is a joke beside HR. Constant policy changes.

It was a good experience.,"I will say this, there are some good people at the Walmart I worked at. very few bad managers, but overall a good experience. The managers do need to address the lack of communication and responding over radios, and that I feel bad for them when I left. The bathrooms will never be the same. The hardest part was honestly the bathrooms just because there so many people just keep coming in.

Great Company but low hours,Walmart is a great company to work for but at only $11.00/h and only about 32 hours a week it's not the best if you have high rent and bills. Everybody is friendly but some members of management can be a little rude at times but they do mean well. Overtime is out of the question.

An Interesting Place,"Walmart has very many things to learn from day to day. You will never leave work feeling unaccomplished. There is always something to do and some way to keep yourself occupied. A typical day at work in Asset Protection was to make laps of the store, surveying the customers and to make sure nothing ""fishy"" was happening. There were always weekly tasks to complete in order to keep our store safe. Our workplace was very laid back, which was a plus, and I was told that during my initial interview. The hardest part of my job was trying to learn the many tasks of an APA during a ""normal"" day. One issue I had during my short employment at Walmart was the confusing array of managers that were scattered throughout the store with varying titles like ""Coach"" and ""People Lead"" who had nothing better to do than sit in the office and gossip. I was released from Walmart without reason and was told ""It wasn't working out"" by an Assistant Manager who I had never seen before.",3,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Concord, NC",10/24/19,2019,10,24

Soulless Florescent Hellhole,"The moment you sign on, you are no longer a person. You are a very, very small piece of a machine that doesn't even need you. Because it doesn't need you, you're expected to be meek and grateful that the machine would even pay you at all. If you have no individual spirit and can easily force a smile to fit your face, then Walmart is right for you. Alternatively, if you're an automation repairman then Walmart is going to be your best friend sometime in the next decade. Walmart is primed and ready for the robotic takeover.",2,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 2 Associate ,"Dixon, CA",10/24/19,2019,10,24
"Decent pay, but stressful","Walmart's management team can vary from very poor to extremely hard working and fair. There are situations in which management does exactly what is needed for their employees, yet other times in which situations are never taken care of, or employees feel tossed to the side. There is a lack of teamwork between many upper managements, and it feels that because of this lack you will have certain managers giving the green light for their workers, but another manager refuses and you will get in trouble. Scheduling is a mess, and word of mouth is never trusted. The way things are done changes every season, and drama in the work place feels very common. I enjoyed my job, but I felt desperate to keep it. The work place felt unpredictable, but it paid decently for the work you did.",3,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Rexburg, ID",10/24/19,2019,10,24
A rigorous yet simple job,"The first thing you would do is check-in, of course, put on the correct attire for the job, including a jersey and a name badge. Afterward, I would set up the pallets and the line for the truck to be unloaded. Once the truck arrived we would get in are designated positions on the line and categorize boxes by departments on the stores on pallets (stacked neatly and safely). Sometime I would be the one to throw or unload the truck and get the numbers checked into the computer. Next, I would do cloth processing, or stocking or the floor in a multifarious of different departments where I would give excellent customer service to individuals who needed it. Every so often, when needed I would operate certain machinery such as a forklift, etc. to move things in the back rooms off the shelves. Toward the end of the day, we would pull the merchandise on the pallets to the floor to be stocked. Sometimes we would stock the merchandise if we had the time to do so, or they would be left for the overnighters to stock. if everything was finished we would either zone aisles or collect carts from outside.  There was no particular difficult part of the job, maybe then rather unloading the boxes of the truck yourself depending on the size of the truck. The culture was friendly and had a lot of diversity. The management was sub-par; certain things could have been recognized more, such as work ethic or safety. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job would be some of the people I worked with and operating the machinery. It gave me something to stay focused on and I was rather good at it.

Plenty of potential for committed associates,"Overall a great organization for those willing to put the time and effort in. I worked my way up from a part time associate in high school to a manager supervising stores in two states. Decided to hang it up after 20 years in the business and look for a job without all the overnight travel 3-6 days per week. This company can be incredibly rewarding and offer impressive compensation if you are willing to give the level of commitment and effort in order to earn it. Like most retail management positions plan to work very long hours with a sacrifice in work/life balance, but if you are seeking compensation/bonus potential and a career path that can let you work all over the country this is a really great business that you can learn a lot of different skills in.",3,Current Employee,Market Manager ,field,10/24/19,2019,10,24

It's a good start out job,Nothing really bad I just started. Like it so far. To me it's a good startup job for teenager trying to get into the workforce. And it's a good ending job for an older person who wants to cut back to part-time or to retire and pick up little hours a week. You never have a set schedule. You tell them when you're available and they put you in 4 hours to work within that time. Example I'm available from 5 to midnight most times I work 6 to 10 or 6 to 11,4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Statesville, NC",10/24/19,2019,10,24

"Sometimes rewarding and fulfilling, other times stressful and anxiety inducing.","The company itself is great, they to care about their workers.

I will always be grateful for that. Then as the time carried on, different management came in, and what started as an actually gratifying job quickly turned into some of the most stressful days I had really dealt with. If you happened to miss one irrelevant thing when they demand you focus on another thing that they say will result in you being terminated if you fail, only to be reamed for missing (as and example) a single mint wrapper that was behind a monitor when you were told to focus on doing a complete strip/wax on 2 action alleys in one night by yourself, then also ream you for not getting the wax perfect while you were by yourself. _x000D__x000D_Now, once again, I have no issue whatsoever with the company.

Assistant manager review,"In training your are taught that the new Walmart does not allow store managers to verbally abuse their managers and not allowed to overwork them bc they are salary. I believed those things. And sometimes these things depends on the store manager. In my area there is 4 super centers and 2 neighborhood markets. The super center store managers still behave this way.  You’ll work 13-16 hours a day, often working one of your days off, depending on the time of year and inventory you may work all your days off. If you have a vacation planned, those are often taken from you. Trying to reschedule  is not easy either. My store manager went through a phase where she constantly threatened us with coaching us/ a write up. With the management restructure has come constant slurs made about how she is tired of doing our jobseekers and not to be surprised at our evals when we get them. Keep in mind our evals we’re all food every other year. It seemed to me that it was going to be a set up for who went where with the restructure and who was only going to be a team lead which meant less money of course",2,Former Employee,Assistant Manager Retail ,Louisiana,10/22/19,2019,10,22

HR is a mess,"Walmart always hires a lot of people during peak season, they'll get back to you quickly and theres no interview just a paid orientation. They hire a lot because many associates quit within the first week.HR is really unorganized, they always lose checks/pay late. The training during peak is bad they just try to get it over with even if you don't really understand the job. The actual jobs there are fairly simple, but you're just really exhausted at the end of the weeks especially during mandatory overtime. The environment is ok, me being a female many men always bug you during your shift and theres nothing you can really do about it because HR or managers won't switch you out of your departments. The pay is alright for the job, but you're not always guaranteed 40 hours a week they let you leave sometimes at your 8th hour or even earlier when theres no work. Also they don't really care about school schedules or anything you'll still recieve an occurance if you call off.

Productive but unfair with their advancement opportunities.,This company use to be family oriented when Sam Walton was alive. His kids took over and messed up the company in my opinion. The associates in my opinion deserves more than what they are paid while the CEO’s are over paid. Favoritism is a problem between management and the associates within the company. Associates are poorly trained on the floor. Management broke rules while I was there while trying to enforce rules on Associates. Communication was/is poor within the company. Bonuses are not fair between Management and Associates. Management gets almost there whole annual salary while associates max out at $500 quarterly. Depending on how well the store sales are. I understand now the attendance policy has changed so that if you miss a weekend day it counts as missing two week days. Making it harder to spend time with family. You are only allowed 5 days missed within a certain time frame before you are terminated.,3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Greensboro, NC",10/20/19,2019,10,20
Enjoyable but managment could use some work,"I enjoyed working for walmart, I felt that work hour flexibility and management ruined my aspiration to work there. When you establish what hours you can work they tend not to stick to it and schedule you for times that affect other things like another job or school you may have. With management I've worked with in the past, instead of working with you to do a job right they demote you when you knew you could have done the job better with better training. not all stores are like that but apparently at one store I did the job quite well and another it was unacceptable. I loved learning new things and helping customers find what they needed and if another employee needed help with something i knew how to do, I loved to help.",3,Former Employee,Dept Manager/Sales Associate ,"Federal Way, WA 98003",10/20/19,2019,10,20

If you stand up for yourself you will loose hours happens to several of co-workers I knew.  Oh I learned after a couple of times traveling to other stores that they pay you for travel  so if you do that make sure you get the voucher. Also use PPTO for leaving early if you have emergency or to take off points, also keep checking the points it will be points that pop up on there out the blue sometime the manager can handle that for you.

When you first start, they promise you all these things and opportunities they are going to give you, that they are flexible and laid back. It's a total lie. They are unreliable, and every little thing will be held over your head. Staffing is a huge issue, partly because no one can make a schedule, and partly because they can't keep workers. It is extremely stressful, and they don't care about their employees. The attendence policy basically holds employees hostage. You are allowed 4 call ins, and any more than that and you are fired. You can aquire paid time off, but you get it so slowly that it's not even worth it. Good luck if you ever need to take a leave because you don't have enough time to cover if you get sick, because you will be denied and you will get fired.

Like to hire you part time then work you full time,In the store I worked in it was always busy. Most time management would not schedule enough people. They hire you in part time then work you full time with out the benefits. They scheduled for 40 hrs/wk then drop you below every few weeks so you don't qualify for insurance! Pay door scanners more than cashier's whencashiers do 10 times more stupid! They promote based on who they like and are friends with.

I learned a lot about retail and how big stores like Wal-mart function to ensure they meet customer and employee satisfaction. Management was confusing, you'd have one store manager and then you'd have a team of supervisors who where not mangers but they do everything a manager would except for the correct thing, meaning the profession wasn't there at times,  they weren't always prepared and they could be a little disrespectful in a couple cases but it doesn't make them bad managers, sometimes the day got the best of them. the hardest part of the job would definitely be getting chewed out by management for incompletion of a maxed-out delivery truck that had to be completed within two hours no matter the size and with only a fraction of the team members required for the size of some of the trucks we were getting, however, the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people you work with, and its not all bad sometimes management cooks food for the employees, they do giveaways, you get benefits, you get your hours (depending on position) you get bonuses every 3 months and they pay extra when your at work and support you when you cant be.",4,Former Employee,RECEIVING ASSOCIATE ,"Holly Springs, MS",10/19/19,2019,10,19

They treat you like an unwanted child,"Management is very rude to the associates and treated with disrespect.  When raises are given, hours are lowered.  Make you work a flexible schedule or they will not put you on the schedule and it also makes it difficult to get a second job, but they don't give you enough hours to survive. If you don't work on Thanksgiving day and/or black Friday then you do not get the extra 15% discount.  You have to be ruthless and heartless in order to move up in this company.

"Only recommended if your looking for a job, Not a career!","Walmart is a joke of a career in my opinion, they pay spine breaking associates who will risk their own health and well being for minimum wage, These are good hardworking people who deserve better. I am a former employee whose seen it first hand, you’ve got management who’s stuck in this deluded state of mind where they all act with a condescending tone and a sense of entitlement like if everyone there is in High school  and the management team are the jocks bullying their way and stepping on the little people (Walmart associates), you could almost say they’re kids with way too much power and very little supervision from their higher ups, they’ll talk to u how they please because they feel Untouchable, at the end of the day it’s your word against theirs sure you can go to hr or to corporate but if there's no solid proof your complaint will get tossed like yesterday’s salad.

Not a bad place to start,"Walmart isn't a bad place to start for any first time workers since it teaches you a variety of skills.

While the job wasn't always fun or thankless at times, for those seeking a low skill job with benefits Walmart is a good choice. They provided health, dental (I think), stock options, a 401k match plan, paid vacation and protected paid time off for sick leave. For those long term workers of a year or longer, each sales year ends the workers can earn a bonus depending of sales and profit, and unused PTO is added to their check at the end of each year. _x000D__x000D_Management is very compartmentalized.

Job Expectations vary too widely for any guarantee,"Let's be honest--there might be a Walmart out there with responsive managers that care about their employees, a job environment that has an adequate amount of associates, and a system that never falls so woefully behind as to be on the brink of failing in some way. But that's not the experience I had in the stores I worked at. training varied wildly or was nonexistent, organizational systems intended to ease the burden and time of tasks were either never taught or simply outright ignored, and communication between levels of management occurred in a way that did not ultimately benefit the associate (ie: I would get several tasks from both my dept managers and my assistant manager, neither would discuss this with each other even when they discussed the needs of the department). Did I hate my coworkers and direct managers? No. Was it ultimately a difficult job skill wise? No. But the level of stress you can get to just by trying to catch up and not fall behind again is exhausting.",2,Former Employee,Apparel/Home Associate ,"Edinboro, PA",10/17/19,2019,10,17

Expectations are Unclear yet Vast,"The Walmart I work at has a problem with respecting employees’ availability; they manipulate the hours given to get employees to stay later or on days they aren’t available. They pay unfairly, and they expect the productivity of three people from one person. I usually have to stay late to finish the work because there weren’t enough people to do it in the time given. My coworkers are good people with good work ethic, but they have become jaded and a little rough until you get to know them. Some of my newest coworkers haven’t been properly trained, so they make many mistakes and aren’t taught how they’re making them. While I still try, I can’t be expected to teach them how to do their job while I’m doing mine; that’s why there are supervisors who can help new employees get acclimated to the job and the tools we use.",2,Current Employee,Associate ,"Warsaw, IN",10/16/19,2019,10,16
Good place but management suck,I would recommend working at Walmart but not the one that I worked at because some of the management didn’t know what they were doing I was only getting 20 hours a week I can’t live off of that and they pretty much made me loose my car because I asked for more hours and they wouldn’t give then to me and I told them I can’t live off 20 hours a week and they said oh well.,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Dover, DE",10/16/19,2019,10,16

Don’t recommend,"Honestly I wanted to like this job so much, I got hired as a cashier (SCOH) . I loved it, fast pace and all, but management is so bad, and when a manager ask you to clock in early you get a point for it , which can lead to determination. I spoke to the manger several times n nothing. They expect so much from you for 12 $ an hour it’s not worth it all. Coworker are lazy, having you do all the work 🤦🏻‍♀️, gets tiring after awhile.

Too few people to keep up with the work load.,Too much work and not enough time. The supervisor is pushed to get more and more done even though there aren't enough workers.

It was okay,"everything in my area had to be clean and it was very frustrating because everything you clean would get un clean in literally 2 seconds because of a customer, and then management breathed down your neck about it.

Management sucks and over worked,Management was all over the place and not cohesive at all. The different managers would pull me to different areas constantly and I could not ever take care of my customers for my area nor keep up with my area. Management would always try to put me on the registers even though I had a doctor's note saying not to do that because it would cause my social anxiety to act up and I would have constant panic attack's when put on the registers. As for my typical days at work I would get to work early like normal and clock in on time and I would go ahead and start trying to organize my area and get stuff done in my area like my department manager wanted me to but about an hour or so into it the other department managers would always pull me to their sections because they can't find their own workers do to them skipping out and of course I would always help out because that's how I am but they would do this every single time I worked which would always constantly cause me to be away from my area for hours on end and if I had customers I had to practically run from one side of the store to the other just to get to the customers and by the time I'd get to the customers they would be mad and of course I would explain what happened and they would usually understand. All I learned was to barely work the pricing gun and that my section of the store did not matter and that I pretty much had to be a dog on a leash for the other managers otherwise they would end up trying to write me up.

Stressful and hectic,Walmart is a tough company to work for. You will not have a work life balance. You will be required to work several holidays and almost every weekend. Working here is very stressful because of the high turn over rate. The company wants you to do the work of 4 people but you are only one person. My dept is completely understaffed.

recently become horrible place to work,"Within the past 3years the culture of _x000D_WalMart has changed for the worse. _x000D_They used to care about employees being satisfied with their_x000D_job and would work with you regarding your shift preferences and_x000D_days off. Now they don't offer any help, if you don't have open_x000D_availability they cut your hours. They also cut everyone's hours_x000D_during the summer but when they are short staffed then they_x000D_are quick to call you to see if you can come in. Never have enough staff to run the place. Expect more and more tasks to be done but no extra compensation. Side with the customer even though you stuck to company policy. Expect you to stay late, come in early and cover other stores with no compensation. Other co-workers are not friendly and have no sense of loyalty. Will leave you struggling then report you to manager. Management_x000D_has no sympathy for employees, and they tell you they can _x000D_easily replace you.

A good place to set a foundation for your work history but not a job you want to make into a career,"Reviews of Walmart vary across the nation however the Walmart I worked at provided me with a flexible schedule along with some basic training for my position as a front end cashier. The management however seemed to take little notice of my introduction into the field of work as turnover rate is high in retail and simply assigned me to jobs which I was unaware of how to complete such as handling a cash register. Most of what I learned was on the job which required me to ""figure it out"". After two or so weeks, I'd figure out the basic routine but after that I figured out that it was all the job had to offer. Unless you plan on climbing the Walmart corporate ladder, I recommend searching for a career of higher value such as learning sales or perusing a college degree.",3,Former Employee,Front End Associate and Gas Station Attendant ,"Katy, TX",10/13/19,2019,10,13

Slowly imploding management structure. Good High school job. Decent pay,"Walmart recently changed the way that their management structure works and functions. Making it so that there is very little to no promise of advancement. Although I would argue that it is a great job for someone in high school. They also do not compensate your wage for prior knowledge and certifications. For instance, i previously had worked there for almost 2 years and was making almost 13 an hour, came back about 8 months after with forklift experience on top of all of my prior knowledge and was only making 11 an hour. I led to be very frustrating along with the fact that they changed their management structure so I had lost hope of moving up.",2,Former Employee,Food Sales Associate ,"Beloit, WI",10/13/19,2019,10,13

Now there are 3 managers that have been amazing , understanding, and encouraging while effectively managing the store and workers happen to all show up when the remaining 2 work at night.

Everything you hear about working for Walmart is true!,"Management is horrible as well as the pay and benefits. They will purposely limit hours scheduled to work so they don’t have to pay benefits out to you. No matter what job you work they will eventually tack on more responsibility and tasks without increasing your pay, basically they expect more for less. The company doesn’t care about their employees at all, they only care for sales no matter the cost.",2,Current Employee,ASSET PROTECTION SPECIALIST ,"Surprise, AZ",10/10/19,2019,10,10
Quick promotion availability,"There are lots of places to go with the company. Lots of quick ways to get promoted.

I would not recommend Mexico Walmart to anyone.  They hire alot of part-time employees so you get no benefits and they cut your hours.,Walmart does not care about the employees.

It's getting worse over time.,"Each time a manager is replaced, the newer manager is more strict and treats each associate with further callous effeciency. They ""do their job"" but you work what they need, or you can leave. Doesn't matter how long you've been there or how good you do your job, you work when they want you to or you will be replaced. The humanity of the workplace is disappearing at an alarming rate. They will not give you a saturday off, even for a case like school. They expect you to work any and all free time in such cases. In this way, their ""true availability"" form is treated like a joke. They will change your schedule however they want without permission, and then will force you into a ever changing schedule by rejecting any ""true availability"" form that they dislike (no fridays, saturdays, or sundays off)._x000D_These same people will give you 4 hour shifts multiple times a week when they don't really need you, but would rather not give you full shifts and an extra day off._x000D_This treatment reminds you how little they value you as an employee. They only care to have their shifts covered, anything else is irrelevant.",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Jersey City, NJ",10/10/19,2019,10,10
Decent place to work,"The job was overall easy work, you know what's expected of you from the start, but it doesn't always stay the same.  Hours are inconsistent at best, but company policies change frequently and not always in the benefit of the employee.   When management stops caring about their employees the environment entirely suffers.  Change in store management, job position availabilities, and hours ended up with many people losing their jobs or leaving them.  The new store management at the particular store I was at sent the store environment downhill. Management was not always there when you needed them to be. Almost everything is out-sourced so going to HR usually results in a 'you have to call this number and talk to this other company's representatives'.  Employees with disabilities are not looked out for as much anymore either.   The pay is great for my area starting out, but cost of living vs pay makes it average out.  Benefits are great, but you have a period of time you have to wait before they are active. Many employee positions changed or were cut just in the time I worked there.",4,Former Employee,People Greeter ,"Paducah, KY",10/10/19,2019,10,10

Its a very enjoyable job with a lot of room for advancement within the company.,"All in all in genuinely enjoyed my job at Walmart and would to peers recommend with a peer, but with a few warnings attached._x000D_   the company culture allows for a lot of flexibility within it and room for individual approaches to given situations. Which is great, it really is, but it comes with the side effect of your peers in your job environment and managers needing to be great at there job  ( supervision, crew management, task management, time management, work under pressure, not abuse employees, etc.) to maintain productivity so you don't end up having to pick up the slack later on in the shift, this happened rarely in my experience in ended in myself and a few others doing what would be deemed by some as an unreasonable work load compared to our peers as a result, which is fine, but after awhile it gets tiring being expected to be a robot a save the day a few shifts a week.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Palm Harbor, FL 34684",10/10/19,2019,10,10

Could be better with reasonable management.,"My experience at Walmart was one of favoritism. I worked at the same store for two and a half years and did outstanding work by my own standards. I sought out advancement, but it seems that you have to be one of the management ""favorites"" to get chosen. Once I transferred stores I tested this theory by cozying up to a few managers and was promoted less than a month later. I then learned of the snarky attitudes and sarcasm that comes with the territory. Why train someone when you can sarcastically poke at them until they figure it out on their own? That's the management experience at Walmart.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Marietta, GA",10/10/19,2019,10,10

Management doesn't really care, and some of them are not even trying to hide that. And of course, if they see that you really want to work, they're gonna treat you like a horse. You'll be exhausted to the point where you just can't anymore.

Wouldn’t advise,"The truth of it. Wal-Mart is a corporate that only cares about the company while making it look like they care about employees. When I worked there, we had openings in my department for full time. The managers were told no more full time because they want less hours, less employees, more work. They expect one employee to do work that is required of 2 people and lower hours if you can’t make the impossible happen. Hourly start up is 11.00/hour which sounds amazing until you realize after a month, your hours are dropping because they are trying to save on labor costs. They expect you to know and do every thing your manager does, but won’t pay you those wages. Try to step up the ladder. It’s all about who you know there. You don’t step up unless a friend of yours is one already. Used to have these managers on Facebook and most of the department managers hung out in personal life. I was pregnant while working there’re and the assistant manager to the store told me that if I couldn’t lift more than 15 lbs needed to find another job because Wal-Mart does not accommodate and I am not disabled. They had no care for the life growing inside of me an expected me to lift boxes well over 50 lbs. I have seen managers give themselves extra discounts or mark down items that should not have been so they wouldn’t have to pay full price. They always find a scapegoat to take the fall. I have seen this a few times. The store manager will never act unless whatever deed accused can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. So make sure your video on your phones are working people!

The money for management is decent.,"outside of the pay scale as far as management is concerned the job is stressful, the turn over is high due to favoritism on the market level which trickles down to store level. My experience within my market is they do not promote based on if you can do the job, they promote based off a buddy system (who you know and who your brown nosing to). Every new managers approach (that I have witnessed) is to fire a lot of associates and slowly replace the abandoned shifts. I left because my position was being eliminated and I found a better opportunity.

Worse place to work.,"Everything about this place is horrible. The management from your market managers to market human resources is a joke. The store managers are horrible and they are disrespectful to their associates.

Don't Do It!,"The first moment I walked into Walmart, I noticed that the long time employees would not make eye contact and seem to be like beat down dogs. All they would do during lunch and breaks is sit around a table and complain about all of the benefits Walmart had taken from them.  Any employee over fifty appears to be crippled in varying degrees from hours and hours of standing on the concrete floors. In two weeks, I began to feel pain in my knees from standing all shift. The cashiers in California had to sue Walmart to get chairs at their checkout. I did the Asset Protection in which you rescan the Valued Customer's groceries coming out of the line. I had several Valued Customers cuss me out, accusing me of accusing them of stealing. For the most part however, the American populace are like sheep and go with what ever they are told, as if it will benefit them in some way. The only people that it benefits is Sam Walton's spoiled, greedy children. By doing this, they are trying to make sure that their cashiers are not sliding merchandise without scanning and charging for it. Seems like to me, they are jumping over dollars to save dimes. Overall, it was a sad experience that only seems like a short, bad dream. I was there only a month. The managers get huge bonuses if they keep payroll down and profits up so, as a lowly associate, you are merely cannon fodder for their higher aspirations. If that is what you want to deal with, have at it, but I love myself too much to have these lame misfits cause me any grief at all.",1,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Payson, AZ",10/7/19,2019,10,7
Fun to be around the other associates and great management,"My typical day at Walmart was just as you'd expect hours of me just standing around, an the occasional working on the sales floor. I learned customers can be rude and we couldn't do anything about. Management was the third best thing about working their, when a customer would have an issue with an associate or other customer a manager would come and resolve the issue with ease.",4,Former Employee,AP Host ,"El Paso, TX",10/7/19,2019,10,7
A decent place to work,"My experience while working at Walmart was a good one. The environment is faced paced, which makes for a busy work day. There is also a lot to learn. And they will train you.

I just wish the raises were better and it was a little bit more fun of an environment to be in.,4,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Chippewa Falls, WI",10/7/19,2019,10,7
It’s An Okay Place To Work,But the managers at this particular location are truly some of the worst managers to ever grave any retail setting. I was taught everything I knew by a manager who switched to overnights. In comes the new assistant manager and suddenly EVERYTHING I was doing was wrong. I think it’s because she didn’t like me and wanted to let me go for awhile so she gave me some petty write-up and coaching. My other co workers and support managers were awesome,3,Former Employee,Lawn and Garden Associate ,"Bullhead City, AZ",10/6/19,2019,10,6
Bad Communication,"A typical day would be finding out what station I’m assigned to & than make sure i have everything I need. I would continue by turning my light on & I would than greet customers.

Worst company ever,The manager I had was  the worst of the worst. I was treated unfairly and talked down to and talk about by her!

Great Place to start off at and advance in if you want to.,Wal-Mart was a great place to work at. My manager and coworkers were nice people and helped me whenever I needed assistance. The culture over there is semi family like. There people there who have been there for decades and there people who are just there for months. It's a blend between the two.,4,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Spring, TX 77380",10/6/19,2019,10,6

Very stressful work environment,"A typical day at work varies daily depending on how busy it is there. Really are never any slow days, especially working in the eCommerce department. Everyday our jobs are within time management, may it be picking the groceries a customer has placed an order for or taking those groceries out to the customer. There is a lot of heavy lifting involved with the job and a very high stressful place to work due to the lack of staffing in the area. I've learned a lot about the job area I'm in and how to deal with unhappy customers.  The management isn't too bad, somewhat all over the place when dealing with two different ones however. There is also a lot of drama within the workplace, complaints, and others not following the rules when needed. The hardest part about the job is really not having the right amount of people which causes stress upon all associates. The enjoyable part of the job is getting to pick the groceries if given the chance, and hearing customers actually say nice things about you if so in survery's they have left.",2,Current Employee,Multiple Positions ,"Hopkinsville, KY",10/6/19,2019,10,6
I enjoyed working as a cashier loved my managers and my customers.,I didn't want to leave Walmart but having an ability I wouldn't have been guaranteed many hours.

Dont do it,"As a new employee you are thrown to the wolves. No training what so ever! Other employees do not want to be bothered with questions that a manager should be answering. Older employees disrepect amd take advantage of the new hires. Dont bust your behind because other employees are just there for a paycheck and are doing as little as they can to pass the time.

Amazing Job!,"Never had an issue working at walmart the manager and employees were amazing, was a relaxed and cooperative job dress code was casual just no hoodies or hats/beanies, reason for leaving walmart is because school work was catching up as I was working in Apex   , NC and I was attending school in Sanford, NC  and I was also clocking out at 11 p.m, really needed to relocate and find a better opportunity for my schedule",4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Apex, NC",10/6/19,2019,10,6
Challenging environment with a sink or swim approach.,"I was introduced to Department Management by becoming one.

Worth it if you brown nose,The store I worked at was horrible the only thing the managers cared about was their yearly bonus the only thing the regional manager cared about is if the store made money.

All about Wal-Mart little about employees,The only time you can call in for an emergency is if you have PPTO if you don’t have (which has to earned by working so many hours) and you miss a day you get written up.

Fun and pleasent work enviornment,"What I learned while working at Walmart is that you can become a family and learn who you can count on for anything. I think that some of the members of management need a little more training on what to do in certain situations, other than that they seem to do an amazing job.

Productive yet stressful,"The hours for this job were come and go. I was hired full time but was lucky to get 32 hours in a week. Normally working with fellow associates can be fun and there are many enjoyable parts to the day, however, management was a bit different. Going to managers with problems in the workplace or something that would need to be fixed would get you nowhere. The manager would brush you off or a day or two later write you up for the problem. Calling in sick even when it was necessary was a rarity to get approved and would normally result in a write up. During a winter storm I was unable to make it in to work as the vehicle being used couldn't move more than a few feet without sliding around on the ice. I called in to inform the manager that I was not able to safely make it in to work, there was a stern lecture about being an unreliable worker when I came back in, my hours were reduced afterwards, and I had received an ""absence point"" to track our attendance at the job for not being able to safely make it into work. Though this seemed to be singled out to a few select managers, this made working there far more stressful especially during the winter time because if you couldn't make it in to work you couldn't quite tell if you would have a job when you come back the next day you can.",3,Former Employee,cashier ,"Moore, OK 73160",10/2/19,2019,10,2
Very hard company to work for.  They put the profit of the company before tteating the associates nicely.,The company is motivated by profit and not the employees or associates.  They have great benefits and the pay is above average but could be more.  The work environment is stressful and demanding.  The expect you to work hours that are constantly changing so you can not make plans unless you ask time off.  They are not likely to grant the time off.  They also have a strict attendance policy.,3,Former Employee,CSM Customer Service Manager ,"Sylva, NC",10/2/19,2019,10,2
Only give 3 stars cause it depends on the store manager and their team on how successful the store will be .,Since I worked for Walmart for a long period of time.

When her and I talked about it beforehand she told me to keep it a secret so people wouldn’t get mad at her then she tried to act like she had not part in promoting me. It was weird.

A few good managers. They always push she good ones out. The bad managers are always the ones to stay. Walmart loves to reward bad behavior.,Walmart is a company where the management loves to reward bad behavior and bullying. The only good managers they have always get punished for something out of their control or are the ones to always blame because they’re good. The store manger always turns a blind eye. He doesn’t agree with younger associates growing up with the company. The young people are his targets especially if they do something good or stick up for someone.

That's usually the calmest of the night though sweeping through areas that are being stocked is almost counter productive if there are pallets involved though I've always finished a full route through the store and sometimes have enough time to backtrack through areas that aren't wet from the scrubber. I've learned how to operate cleaning equipment and proper techniques for spills, as well as customer support. There were good members of management and some that weren't as good. And some were inappropriate at times. The people around me were mostly separated by when you would go to lunch, the older people were always nice and friendly, though a group of stalkers would love to talk bad about someone if it were on their minds. The hardest part was trying to catch up if you were pulled off to do something, though usually the last in the floor line would be pulled before the other two.

Customer oriented with low chance for career advancement,"Any workers under management level are trained by computer programs on how to do their jobs.

When I worked in the academy most days were preparing classrooms for incoming trainees, then doing a mix of in class training and hands on training on the store floor.  Days I didn't have class I was to do audits or help out in the respective departments I trained managers in.  When I was put in Support manager position I was given the back room.  I took the position when I was told I was too young and needed more experience before applying for an Assistant manager position (even though I had 4 years of experience as an Assistant manger from other companies). I was under the impression I would be working with the other associates to gain the experience needed however, found out I was to be the only one in the backroom cleaning it up by putting up overstock and getting rid of trash and empty pallets. After 7 months in this position, I asked about the Assistant Manager training program again and I was told I needed to hold my current position for 5 years before they would let me apply.

If you work overnights, don't expect anything. It doesn't matter how hard you work, how much you exceed expectations, there's no chance of you ever moving up unless you're a favorite. There is a huge lack of communication between shifts, and management, and WAY too much drama.

As far as I am concerned, I don't think it's terrible. I think that it will become tiring and stressful but it definitely pays your bills. It shows you what you want in life and to grow.

Walmart review,I found that the work isn’t too difficult and usually pretty straight forward but management has high expectations such as employees from one department working in other departments when they’re short employees. This wouldn’t be an issue if they wouldn’t promise raises and promotions for work you learn that you won’t end up getting paid for. They also don’t work well with part time employees.,2,Former Employee,Front End Service Associate ,"League City, TX",9/27/19,2019,9,27
