Management will throw you under the bus,"It was fun when I first started as I expected all jobs to be when you’re first hired. The only reason it was fun was because of the Co-Manager that was working there when I got hired. He made the job fun, he interacted with just about every associate he ran into and he would actually work too. Not like most management who would just tell you what to do and expect it to be done with no help. But anyways he made the work environment fun. About a year after I was hired he got promoted and got his own store, and we received a new store manager. Long story short, I feel like management should make the job comfortable and fun for the employees, like interact to every associate you see working for you. The job doesn’t have to be about work work work all the time. Especially with the pandemic we are facing right now. Another thing I got thrown under the bus for something that wasn’t my fault and got red flagged, never had a coaching or write up or nothing, so basically anything else I did that was coachable I would be fired.",1,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Pine Bluff, AR",10/8/20,2020,10,8

But what they dont tell you is they will send you home if the computer system says they only need so many people for the day to do the work load. So if you come into work expecting to do your job the next second they will send you home and it's up to the supervisor who goes and you dont get paid for the day.

Decent workplace,I would say it’s a decent place to work. One of the things they should change is the pay rate. Online Grocery Pickup should make way more than 11.50 for the labor they have to do. They have to work the hardest on a daily out of all the other departments in the store. The recognition definitely doesn’t show in the pay rate. ,3,Former Employee,Walmart eCommerce ,"East Peoria, IL",10/7/20,2020,10,7

Easy work of management used common sense,"Favoritism is an ongoing problem, but that’s in almost every major corporation. There are 3 managers in the OGP department, and when they are needed you can never seem to find any of them. Walmart will deny any and all requests you take off for any reason from sick to funeral attendance. You will get points for every informed a sense, tardy, etc. and they add up into an unlawful point system that you will constantly be threatened with. Overall, it is easy enough work. However, management does not utilize their resources efficiently. There is not enough equipment (TCs, printers, bags for the items, carts, etc.) for all of the employees to use. Management does not want to deal with customers and almost never assist with any situation or complaint from a customer. Upper management coaches OGP management for mistakes they make, then OGP management will then turn around and blame the hard working associates for their mistakes. The safety violations in the back are too much to list, and when there are rushes of 8+ cars ready to receive their order, management will place 1 dispenser and have other co-workers helping an entirely different department stocking. All management does is pick exceptions, meaning when you cannot an item while picking, they go back out and find something similar to it. That’s all they do. And they have 3 managers at a time doing it. They do not deserve to get paid for what they do when their employees are doing the hard labor. You will be paid $11.50/hr. which isn’t bad, but 80% of the time is not worth the bs you have to put up with.",3,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Belton, TX",10/7/20,2020,10,7
They make changes and leave associates in the blind they dont communcate well and talk to associates like children ,Walmart use to be a wonderful place to work now it has gone to the dogs trying to keep up with Amazon moral is down in stores favoritism amongst Managers and associates at the rate it's going its gonna close more stores in future,1,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Longview, TX",10/7/20,2020,10,7
"It started as you felt appreciated, then it turned to just reaching sales goals with little to no appreciation from management.","Company is cool to work for.  Promotions were based on favoritism.  I felt that all my hard work was only recognized by my immediate manager, but when it was time for promotion, he did little or nothing to help me advance, after I took on a department roll, without compensation as a company ""favor"", and after over 8 months of this training/favor i was denied the promotion.  Even after I passed the Management skill test.  Moral fell after that.  No consideration for alternating employees working on holidays.  worked for company two years and had NO HOLIDAYS OFF.  Management did not care, denied requested holidays off, and then I didn't get a bonus due to too many accurances, that  did not affect me missing any holiday.  Really feel used and abused on that end.  As for learning the retail merchandising day to day operations, I learned a lot.  My manager was a great teacher, and if he had the time he would have been a great  department manager trainee , and made the job fun.Overall, I give the company a B- for a company to work for.

Bad management ,"I worked here for a year and a half as a cashier. At first it wasn’t bad, about what you would expect for a cashiering job, pay was good especially for a teenager. After I had worked there for 6 months we got a new manager up front who was absolutely horrible. She made it impossible to get days off, she wouldn’t stand up for associates and would get mad at them for doing their job, she would act like she was able to help when she just didn’t want to.

It's Walmart.,Good if you just have to have something for income or if you're young and starting out. Hard to advance if you aren't picked out by your managers to be mentored. Little in the way of flexibility. Typical retail.

"Good salary, good management, decent job if you are younger","Worked 4 ten-hour days, 2nd shift 3:30pm -1:30 am, Mon -Thurs.  3 day weekends were nice.  I worked a physical job in dry goods, loading pallets for orders to be sent to various, regional Walmart grocery stores.  This involved a lot of heavy lifting and stacking and a lot of walking on the cement floors of the warehouse.  If I was in my 20's, like many co-workers, it would have been fine, because the pay was very good.  However, I was 45 and I started to get arthritis in my hands, tendonitis in my elbows, and chronic back pain.  Managers were good people that cared about their team.

Sunnyside store is awful,Depending on your job code it depends what your doing the store has very little communication unless its gossip and even if you keep your head down and do as your told people will still talk about you to management even if its not true. There is no steady schedule either it is supposed to be set 3 weeks in advance but management team lets the computer system generate a schedule but doesn't go based upon your availability or is even consistent.  So good luck if your applying in Sunnyside.,1,Former Employee,Department Manager Wal-Mart ,"Sunnyside, WA",10/6/20,2020,10,6
Employees make it fun ,"I worked at two locations. Most days I dreaded going into work and seeing those long lines, but I made wonderful friends that I still  have to this day that make surviving the day better. Breaks were usually forgotten because  of how busy it is, but I appreciated the 1 hour lunches and 2 fiftheen minute breaks, some companies only give you 30 minute lunches and 2 breaks.

Very results driven place.

When we get there you learn whether you're lucky or not, if you're lucky you get a scanner, if you're unlucky you don't get one which hinders your job greatly. The management was alright, they were nice most of the time and easy to approach and usually very helpful if you needed a scanner or had questions about other work related things. The work place culture was very competitive but at the same time extremely friendly, I felt like almost everyone were friends with each other. It was almost like study hall from highschool during our breaks, it was nice and fun but there's nowhere to get alone time if you need it. The hardest part of the job was trying to get a scanner/trying to work without one since only the senior staff can get scanners on their own. They were known for leaving basically none for the new people even though the senior staff didn't need them.

Fair pay for a fair job...if that's all you need,"Typical big company management attitude:  ""Do more with less..."" which translates to continually adding more and more duties onto workers but at the same pay rate.  Workplace is chronically under-staffed; management does not respond by hiring, but by riding the current staff to work faster.  But... Great workers only make as much as total slackers... So, why would ANYone put forth much effort?  And, generally, that's what happens... everyone becomes DE-motivated and discouraged.Also, advancement is becoming more difficult with management changes that eliminate many low/mid-level management opportunities.",2,Former Employee,Inventory Control Clerk ,Missouri,10/4/20,2020,10,4

Walmart: quick and dirty associate review,"it's okay, there are certain advantages to being at the associate level. Unless you do something incredibly egregious your job security is there. They will keep you as long as you want to be employed there. I personally found it hard to promote, which spurred my decision to leave after several years. However, if you are more well liked by management there is always chances to promote. I would say the compensation is fair for the work done, however to make a lot of money one would have to become an assistant manager or equivalent. Theres a lot of things that are your mileage may vary given so many different locations: management team may be good or bad, culture of the store may be good or bad.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Citrus Heights, CA",10/4/20,2020,10,4

"Not a stable job, does not care for employees","Let's start off by saying Walmart treats the employees like they are disposable. Literally, rips the rug out from beneath them. Firstly, when the company changes direction (no warning just removes people from jobs). Secondly, you have no job security (none). Now let me say I understand a company changes and adapts, but they do this not caring about the people they affect. When I say affect, I mean you come into work and are walked into an office to be let go. They close stores like a hooker gets laid in New York. They take away they put back, but the people they trample on mean nothing. Want to know why because you my friend are just a number. You can be replaced by someone who will do it cheaper. It is so sad to see the Wal-Mart I used to know, turn into a greedy corporate mess. Literally Wal-Mart is a hot mess. Please just get a job somewhere else. I would rather work at a fast food chain than work for Wal-Mart. Seniority this means nothing, as well. Truth hurts Wal-Mart and I just stopped shopping here altogether.

"Good pay, management sux and do not know how to treat associates with respect","The pay at Walmart is competitive,  they pay a lot better than any other job that doesn't require a degree or certification.  They also offer pretty good benefits.  The down side of working at Walmart is the managers.  Some of them treat you like dirt, and they do not know how to interact with associates.  They really need some training in how to deal with different personality types, and training in how to treat people with respect.  They also don't care about your home life at all. I know so many people that have been fired for missing work for things like being in the hospital,  or missing work to take care of a terminally ill loved one. It is also kind of hard to advance your career because all of the management roles are taken by people that have worked there for 15 or 20 years,  and they walk around the store acting like they are Walmart royalty, and all the associates ""below"" them are there slaves.

Very poor,"Working at Walmart is good if you like being taken advantage of. They have WAY too many managers and people in charge.

They don’t follow the safety rules, or many of any rules for that matter unless they head the head people coming in, or it’s something like inventory time. They don’t treat people equally, and play favorites. You voice your issues and concerns through their open door policy and they do nothing about it. Overall if you can handle all of that’s it’s a place to work. To me the stress and headache of the job wasn’t worth it.

Poor workplace with unhelpful management that condone awful conduct. Overworked and underpaid. ,"When I started working at Walmart, I was excited. I loved being a cashier, having drive-though conversations, competing to obtain the highest possible scans per hour, while providing excellent customer service. I quickly became their yes-man, working as much as 70 hours per week. Coming in early, staying late, sacrificing my days off. During black Friday I voluntarily worked 24 straight hours, minus the government mandated lunch breaks of 30 minutes every 6 hours.After my first 6 months I got promoted, I went from $12.75/h to $14.03/h, and shortly after went to $14.31/h due to the yearly evaluation.Shortly after this, my assistant manager was helping me in the ""bins"". The backroom. He didn't like the way I moved a stack of boxes, so he deliberately slapped one off the stack and it fell on my head.I went through the right channels despite how angry I was. I went to my store manager and told him of the situation. After he spoke with asset protection he informed me there was no footage. Obviously that meant that they can get away with doing nothing about it.After that I had it. I started giving just enough effort to not get fired, and eventually taking a leave of absence.

Horrible ,This is a very sink or swim atmosphere. It was like getting a job in outer space people were too busy to even look at you much less train you . Vast amounts of tedious unexplained projects they squeeze every last inch of work from you until you collapse on the floor . Will give you a 100 $ bonus then a week off after . Extremely Stingy with overtime! Customer service is discouraged because it takes you away from your robotic assembly line and mind numbing stocking . if you even say hi to someone on the floor you get stared down . People were dying left and right at the store I worked at . Training non existent good luck eating on break because if you do happen to have a little money on you for once you have to stand in line with all the Customers and all the other employees that are on break and only one cashier is open.

Management lies a lot, they would constantly lie to me and say new employees were making less than me. New employees would show me their pay grade and it was most definitely more than me. And they will lie about tons of other things like, why they deny days off and etc. basically rule of the wise, ask more than one manager, you will see how much they lie. If you don’t tell a manager an issue you are having about 10 times in a row. They will never follow through and forget it and act like you never told them.

As of now they’re  restructuring and cutting all sorts of positions so job security is at an all time low. There are much better retailers out there that are starting to listen and pay better wages.

Terrible,"This company, regardless of location, is terrible to work for. None of the managers care about the employees and way too many of the customers are extremely rude.

Former employee,"Work-life balanceI loved my job at first. Unfortunately, the managers loved to give you an assignment then another manager come up behind you and give you another assignment tell you not to do but you were just told. We work extremely short-handed most of the time. Also dealing with customers that would threaten you and treat you horribly and management would not do anything about it. Your 10% discount was a joke because it only covered certain items. You only got 10% off on food during the holidays. During the holiday season you work extremely long hours can I get to visit your family very much at all. In our store you will be asked to work overtime but then on Friday leave early so you would it would not have to pay you your overtime.

My store however was ran by a store manager that did his own thing and traded his employees with no respect.Pay & benefitsYou earn PTO time longer you work there but you were not giving holiday pay or sick days.

If a manager didn't like you, trust me they'd find a way to get you fired. Unless you were an exceptional employee. To advance you needed to apply for management openings and interview for them like most places.ManagementThe managers think they are absolute royalty that are not to be touched or spoken to out of turn. There are a few I learned to watch out for specifically: the overnight manager (a tall guy with curly hair who think women should submit to him) and the front end manager (a short red haired woman who shares the power trip of female police officers). My department had some really awesome people in it, and even though my manager was really cold she did care about giving us recognition when we did good work.CultureMost employees from other departments are toxic and nasty for no reason. One time an employee from another department dropped something that made a loud noise so I turned my head to look, and she said ""What the f*** are you looking at b***"". That's just the day-to-day vibe there. As a personal shopper, the people stocking were always rude if you needed to get something from the 20 shelves they were blocking. So if you worked an early morning shift you basically had to fight with someone in every single aisle to pick up something on your timed run. Oh, and they know that you get timed.

There are too many changes being brought down by COVID-19 and those changes are not relayed.  The equipment needed to complete your job/function is not always available.  Most Associates need a scanner (and access to a printer) to do their jobs quickly and efficiently and the equipment is not there.  There are only a limited number of scanners and those are taken at the beginning of the day and not turned in until the user goes home so Associates that come to work later in the day must wait until a scanner is turned in at 4 p.m. to try to check one out.  Rules that are published are not always followed by all and there are a few Associates who are allowed to get away with anything.  There is no equality among Associates.

In the short time I worked here, the management had changed what ""suspicious activity"" was at least 8 times and almost all communication was; Manager A tells one of many customer hosts about how something should be done, then we all slowly have to hear it from them.

IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE PHARMACY TECH ROLE DONT APPLY HERE, THEY DO NOT LIKE TRAINING NEW PEOPLE. If you are like any normal person on the planet who doesn't have a photographic memory and need to be shown something for than just a millisecond, and you ask questions they WILL be mad at you and they will fire you within your first few weeks for not understanding and there is little to no training, they just expect you to know it, even as a new pharmacy tech. They will talk about you behind your back and gossip will impact whether you keep your job or not. The pharmacist intentionally and admittingly watched me on the cameras for hours to catch me slipping up and to get anything to use against me, that's how dedicated these people are to getting rid you of you. They set you up for failure.TL;DR: There is literally 0 job security. $12.50 an hour is not worth the immense stress, pressure, and anxiety you are put through and that's the gospel truth. this is literally the worst place to get your start in the pharmacy world you're better off working at pizza hut at least they treat you with some dignity.

Job security ,Cap 2 is an easy job essentially You start off the shift by having a team meeting talking about how many trucks were going to come in that you had to unload and who was going to be working in which department they usually have the bigger guys always unloading the truck but sometimes if there aren’t enough people they’ll have everyone unloading the truck while if you’re not unloading the truck you’d be putting out the paper products which would be toilet paper and paper towels and then by the time you’re done doing that to people unloading the truck we have been almost if not already done and then you would go take the cart from whatever area you were Assigned and begin stocking the shelves until the end of your shift,5,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Fall River, MA",9/25/20,2020,9,25

I wouldn’t take my chances  with this company at this point. If others offers come please take them before going here. Let this be your LAST stop.

They don’t car what’s going on in your personal life or even work life. You are a number to them and are easily replaceable. They make it sound good but whatever.

Walmart is a job that will pay the bills,"Work-life balanceThey will work with you if you work for them...but you have to prove your worth in the first few years you are there. You need to be consistent.Pay & benefitsPaid leave depends on how long you have worked there. Pay fits cost of living IF you are not the sole source of income. If you are single living in an apt with no children paying market rates for rent (meaning not adjusted based on income) you can pay your living expenses but you would be eating ramen everyday.Job security and advancementJust because you move up doesn't mean they will keep you around or at your home store. Currently undergoing an internal management restructuring.CultureDepends if you are at store level or corporate. Also depends on the relative volume of your store.OverallThere are many opportunities to do different things but you have to become good at what you are hired into first. I think the commercials mislead the millennial generation. You are not going to be a manager (not even a dept manager) walking in the door without some experience. Typically people move to different positions after working in one position for a few years. When you are first hired move with a sense of urgency, be respectful/ do what you are told to do without complaint, and dont BS on the clock and you will be surprised what opportunities you are recommended for.

Rewarding and Demanding ,"My primary job at Walmart is Cake Decorator, two days a week. It’s been a lot of fun learning new skills and seeing people happy with the cakes I’ve decorated.

This is very stressful if you’re slicing meat for an hour at a time when you have a cake order that is due to be picked up within the hour. You also have to make backup cupcakes and no one understands why you didn’t get finished. They act as though you haven’t been slicing meat all day.The other three days a week I’m a self checkout host. This means I constantly move from the self checkout area to a register and sometimes to the front doors to cover breaks/lunches. I enjoying visiting with customers while I’m working and helping them.

Driving training program is good for people that have their license already to fix the little things (backing, shifting,etc)not for someone with permit because they don’t help you or explain certain things to you they just throw you in the truck with out knowing the safety part. Guys with permits kinda had a hard time and relied on other people or YouTube to explain what it did or why it was there.

One Star ,"I highly enjoyed my time as a Training Coordinator at location 3232. Corperate decided to do away with all office positions to work on budgeting in other areas such as OGP. That broke my heart. I would have stayed a training coordinator until I retired, I loved it so much. I was able to teach the associates about dollar a day college when the program first rolled out. I would help so many associates with benefits/basic questions/guideance. I enjoyed teaching orientation and helping all new hires through their training programs electronically and on the floor. I also helped multiple departments as needed. In an HR meeting they told my PC (personnel coordinator) and I that we would be losing our jobs soon. They said they would try to place us all in positions through out the stores if necessary. They offered my PC a cashier position. She was in her 50's with health issues. She had to find another job as she could not be on her feet that long. I decided to leave the company. It was a difficult decision because mentally I thought I would retire with Walmart. The new job I was offered in healthcare asked me to start within 5 days of the offer. I was only able to give a 4 day notice because of this. But my job would have been gone in a month anyways. So I don't feel too badly about it. I had to keep food on the table for my family. Because I did not give a full 2 week notice, I was labeled unrehirable at Walmart.

Multiple issues,"Been here for 6 years, with 4 different managers, and over 10 different assistant managers, now ""Team Leads."" The team leads hold different expectations for each person in their team, they put you in new areas and expect perfection without training, and to use a stocking system that does not work and wastes time. When they pull you to do an area, it leaves other departments dry, while refusing to do any work of their own to help with the deadlines of keeping up with the loads, so the next day you work you are over burdened by the previous load that couldn't get finished due to little to no coverage. The coverage is managed by someone outside of the store, allotting a certain amount of hours per week to the store, always below what we need. They allow employees to become lazy in their positions, simply downstacking pallets by the deadline and doing nothing else for the rest of the day. When associates complain about this behavior, management refuses to do anything about it and expects more from the people complaining rather than face the issue head on. If the lazy worker they don't fix is stuck alone for the day, the load doesn't get finished, it gets put on carts for someone else to work the next day, but that's fine, right? The work load is feasible and enjoyable each day with enough people, but we are always understaffed by atleast one person, with a call out or two on top of the missing person, someone might get pulled to another department, and management still carries the same expectation.

I'm thankful for the knowledge I have gained.,4,Current Employee,GM Support Manager ,"Gilford, NH",9/17/20,2020,9,17
Not the ideal place for me,"I worked in CAP 2 which is basically unloading the trucks and depending on what aisle your assigned you take your merchandise and you stock the shelves and what you don't stock you bring it back as overstock.Overall it wasn't the worst but it certainly isn't fulfilling or gave me a sense of growth. I'm just stocking the shelves for hours at a time and honestly it just made me depressed. The pay wasn't bad though, made the most money I ever made at this place being $15 dollars an hour and double that on overtime.But besides the work not really doing it for me, what killed my experience here was the environment and the management. None of the other employees were especially nice nor inclusive towards me. They just spoke and interacted towards people they already knew and didn't really pay much attention to me. Besides a few nice employees who were nice to me, the rest of the employees and the management were very cold and distant. I also found them very insensitive as one manager gave me a hard time about not having an app for work, even though it wasn't necessary in the first place. And when I went to another manager about concerns with my schedule he was very vocal at how bad of news of me requesting a change to my hours because of school. It made me feel like I made a mistake, he just seemed super annoyed with me because of it. And the previous manager told me that they understand that we had a life before Walmart and they'll work with me with whatever concerns I have. That wasn't true.Overall compared to when I first started in job orientation where everyone was so nice - more...",3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Watertown, NY",9/16/20,2020,9,16

It's a job. The more you work the more hours you make tobsue for personal time or sick days.,Walmart is not a horrible job.

Walmart is not a good company to work for,Worked part time a few months and have seen very poor scheduling and management. Poor scheduling causing the staff to quit and constantly hiring part timers.

Management really makes or breaks how well this job goes,"I worked in the Online Grocery Department at Walmart, and I'll just say it was awful. At first, it wasn't too bad, and the orders were manageable, but our managers were really ambitious with how many orders per hour they wanted us to do, so they kept upping it.. but they did not up our amount of staff. So we were constantly understaffed, and our wait times on multiple occasions reached over 90 minutes. Having to dispense in cruddy weather already sucks, but when you get yelled at by customers who actually have every right to be mad, it just makes for a miserable experience. Then on top of that management favored 30 year old drug addicts who bullied anyone who wasn't in their little clique, and loved to try and get me in trouble. Keep in mind, I was literally an 18 year old in high school. They would scream at us to hurry up, while sitting on a stool doing nothing but answering the cell phone while we did all the grunt work outside. When I finally reported it to management they acted like they respected and valued my input. Then they made one of the drug addicts a manager. Needless to say that was the last straw for me and I got a much better job.",3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Salem, OR",9/16/20,2020,9,16

Poorly Ran,Management is too preoccupied taking 20 smoke breaks instead of helping the store. I took a team lead spot and took a pay cut because corporate didn't view hourly team leads as valuable as base level associates so we all made less than entry level people.

It really was an alright place to work. Great for teens and retirees!,"I worked at the Warsaw Walmart for several years as a second job after my manufacturing shift. Really was ok, temperature controlled, loved lawn and garden and grocery, the people were great to work with. No drama, just come in, get your shift done, and go home. The general public is hard to deal with sometimes so i did have the flexibility to work in the back room alot. That's great because im not a huge people person (I know, why work somewhere like that?! It really all did work out.) Things i did not like, was how hard they kept you well under the 40 hour mark. It bothers me when places will have you work over several hours one day then kick you out at the end of the week because they just flat out refuse to pay overtime. Now, with that, they also worked hard to keep people at that fine line and would help them get welfare/benefits and such. Makes no sense and in my opinion should be criminal to do that. Another thing, is no discount on grocery items, only general merch. Most things are a 200 percent mark up, so i never saw a reason why they couldn't give us a 10 percent off for food. And at the time i worked there, the general manager was a complete alcoholic, that is not the stores fault HOWEVER, they let that go on way too long.

Good until new manager came into place.,"The company itself is a great place to work. Two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch as well as good pay.

be warned,"if you're applying here for a part time job there are a few things you should know!1-these people never answer the phone. Not even after reports have been filed with corporate. So if you have to call HR back..expect to sit on a ringing phone for no less than 5 minutes and have to call back a few times because when they DO answer the phone they either will not take a message and tell you to call back later or hang up on you. 2- HR will NOT work around a full time job schedule. The reason I say this is because of my experience here. I had to schedule vacation days to make it in for orientation and CBL. Then on my orientation day I had to work a few hours at my job..so I went into my first job..and unfortunately got out late due to a meeting. I went into orientation anyway, figuring I would only be a few minutes late..to be refused by HR who stated that they HAD worked me into THEIR schedule and they could not perform orientation because I showed up 10 minutes late. They wasted my gas and my vacation days to refuse me employment after all that. -3 they will not hire for what they interviewed you for. I say this because my boyfriend was hired for backroom unloader and wound up stocking shelves from day 1. So be warned. The place is a bad joke.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"danville, Indiana",9/16/20,2020,9,16

Good for Part-time or a first job,"Walmart is a pretty good place to work if you're trying to find your place within the workforce. Some days are easier than others. Familiarize yourself with your store and each department. Regardless of your role you will have customers stopping you every other minute. Working as an Apparel Associate is a lot more than folding clothes. For instance, sorting through returns and damaged goods, answering the phone, folding the clothes on tables and on the walls, zoning, and organizing. You are also responsible for maintaining a clean department, so knowing where items that customers leave around is important. The job is never done. Your area will be neat and clean one second, but when you turn back around it will look like you never touched it. You will more than likely have to fold the same table of clothes multiple times throughout the day, so zone as you go. Depending on your department manager, you will either be assigned a section for the day (Men, Women, Infants/babies, Boys, and girls).

Management = Trash (results may vary on location),"Most unprofessional group of management I've ever been apart of.Managers are never on the same page , they are too busy stroking their superiority complexes and having  relations with each other and their subordinates,they get psychology training on how to pressure their workers into busting their backs Red Book( harassment/private issues) are spread around the store like wildfireNo matter how good you are or how well you do they will always push for more.The second you stand up for your team or self ,they will not hesitate to remind you that no one is forcing you to show up and work there.Bonuses lead to half the store getting their hours cut leaving the associates who keep their hours picking up the slack",2,Former Employee,Stocker/Receiver ,"Cleveland, TX",9/15/20,2020,9,15

Awful. No training. No COVID precautions. ,"Sure, they tell you that you have to wear a mask and that you'll be screened before coming into work -- what a joke. Masks were barely worn the right way, hardly ever covering the nose. One girl had her mask barely even covering her chin. Managers didn't say a thing about it. Behind doors, masks came completely off. And health screenings? Didn't even look to see if I passed my assessment or checked my temperature. I was given absolutely no training coming in as a ecommerce personal shopper. Literally just thrown to another employee to ""shadow"" them. In the span of a day, I kept being given employee after employee to shadow them. When I finally managed to find a manager, I asked if I was supposed to just keep shadowing....and yup. Keep shadowing. Second day, I couldn't find a manager or supervisor to ask what I should do. A co-worker had me shadow her, but really it was me doing her work for her. Sigh. Eventually was given my own device to do personal shopping on my own, but kept getting bothered to see if I had questions over and over again in a really condescending way. When I finally HAD questions, I couldn't find a soul. I had no way to find someone to help me while on the floor, no radio or anything.End of the day on the second day, went to go find a manager to talk to them about getting actual training or what was going on period. Couldn't find the manager at all or any supervisor. Awful awful awful. ",1,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,United States,9/15/20,2020,9,15

Horrible place to work.,"There is not enough space here to fully describe the garbage that is walmart. They care about money, customers, and salaried management and that's it. They only care about the customers because of that money. As an associate, you're treated as trash often. For the meager pay, they act as if they have given you much and ask far more than they deserve. Management takes no accountability for when things go wrong. They just go down the line pointing fingers till they hit the associates.I have worked for this trash company for too many years and sacrificed too much. My body hurts from the physical demands of working on Cap 2 - truck unloader - and in the meat dept. downstacking pallet after pallet of meat in 30+ pound boxes in a 37 degree cooler. All they give you is a jacket worn by everyone. Need significant warmth to survive all those hours in the freezer/cooler? You buy it all yourself. All this while people yell at you for not being fast enough when you ARE fast enough. They always want more from you and give you no help and then demand miracles. My store has had so many great people quit because they just burn you out and demean you. I've had enough and I'm leaving soon.No one should work here over the age of 20. A first, temporary job is all this should be. I have stayed too long because you end up working with great people, not for great people.This is a selfish, heartless, fake company that brags about itself while devouring its associates physically and mentally. I have always given my best and have been backstabbed, lied to, and treated like trash.

Don't stick around unless you want to go into Management,"One of the worst things about Walmart as a company is that they are all about MONEY, and yes, every company is, but one of their worst traits is to find ways to save it at the expense of the employees. Getting rid of their Sunday differential pay, ending their 401k contributions for a few years, offering abysmal health insurance, and deliberately short staffing their stores to save on payroll are just some of many ways Walmart looks out for THEIR best interests.

I was there for many years and I believe they let me go because of my age.  They are very selective  in choosing  their “chosen few”. If they want  you  out ,they will have a find a reason.  Trust me everything i have written is true.  You have to be an employee who doesn’t make mistakes and knows the right people.ManagementIn general, managers at Walmart  are like managers.

Positive work environment - everyone wants you to succeed,If you like to work with a variety of people this is the place for you.  Not only do we have a great cross section of ages and education but I have found if you treat people the way you like to be treated it's a win-win.  I know there are always times when it's a little harder to stay positive but the majority of the time the customers as well as the employees and supervisors make it a joy to be there.  Whether it's someone who just happened through on their way somewhere else or customers you see weekly it's a great place to make someone else's day as well.  They have an education program for those who want to continue - HR can tell you more about that.  ,5,Current Employee,Scan & Go Hostess ,"Middlefield, OH",9/13/20,2020,9,13

Stable place of enployment,"Walmart is a job that anyone can get hired into provided they dont have anything on their background check/ drug test.  Pretty Standard. I think the best part of working here is that you have a stable job as everyone shops at Wal-Mart. If your dept isn't offering you enough hours, they have open shifts in other depts so you can pick up some hours. Mgmt tends to be ok with people coming in a little early at times too, with permission. If you need time off, as long as HR is made aware and you do what they ask, you can have time off. We also have ppto which is time off that you can use any time for any reason without penalty, including if you were late to work or left early. The maternity leave is excellent if you are full time or have worked full time a year prior to leave. The pay is decent considering the field of work and you can meet some good people that you work with. There are opportunities for advancement and I'd say there's a good chance you can move up, but they look at your work history and how you work, and I think it can be challenging for some people to move up or even to a different dept. We need more staff currently and the virus situation has hurt things further. If there isn't anyone to fill your shoes, its hard to go to another dept and hurts when people need off. Also customers want more staff and it just takes time to find people and keep people. Id say we get a standard amount of training and the rest, you just ask your co workers and mgmt team. Communication is key. There are 3 different shifts you can work here and part or full time availability so its - more...",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,Dubuque ,9/13/20,2020,9,13

Great job itself sucky work environment,"At my time at Walmart I liked the place for the most part, the job was easy and I didn't have to worry about angry customers or have to deal with them as much. The problem was after working there for a while I learned that doing your job means nothing to the management. You will get criticized no matter how hard you work and its never enough for them. I was either too slow or not doing my job according to them. Because I am on the floor I sometimes have customers bother me because they need something. So when the management couldn't find me at my area I got yelled at and written up. So if your going to work here prepare to not be VALUED as an employee and get a talking to for every little thing you do. me as a handicapped employee I noticed I was targeted a lot more by management so just be warned. also did I not mention Walmart's IMPOSSIBLE expectations for stocker's? it's insane They wanted us to do two seven foot pallets by ourselves in an hour! how the heck are we suppose to do that?  especially if those pallets are both canned goods? its insane. if you want to work here go for it but you'll be miserable and wont enjoy it what so ever.",2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Covington, WA",9/13/20,2020,9,13

With the proper management Walmart is the best job I’ve ever had! It is probably the only grocery store job I’d willingly work long term.,"Walmart is the best job for beginners in the work force, teenagers, special needs, old people and even antisocial people. With the proper management you’ll have no complaints because there’s something to do for everybody and the CSM’s are usually nice enough to let you do what your comfortable doing . Example if you applied to be a cashier but get anxious when lines are long they’ll have you take a few people then do returns pick up trash and hangers clean, help bag, go get things for customers or even help you bag as you scam if the lines are tooooo bad. But the only downside of that is not all managers are good managers and Walmart see’s experience and thinks of a perfect candidate when really hiring the wrong manager can result in a lot of quitting and lack of motivation.",4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Sun Prairie, WI",9/13/20,2020,9,13
The People can make or break your experience,"I feel the overall experience could be great, but the People there however are really rude and inconsiderate.

They also have a sheet that gives the ""Supposed"" time that it should take to work a designated area, which is just ridiculous considering they don't factor the mess that is left in those sections because other shifts leave things for us to deal with. Not to mention lots of small freight that takes a good amount of time to complete. Should you not meet their unrealistic expectations then they will write you up.

Work experience ,"Worked as a cart pusher and was excited because I know it was something that would be fun for a part time job. First day at work, did some testing which took almost a week with a couple of hours a day. Then after my testing, got to work for the first day. Meet a great person that would teach me and work along with me through the months. Best experience by far with a partner, till I found out that we also gotta to side jobs. We had to do the garbages outside of Walmart almost everyday when it needs it badly. No matter if it was raining, we had to take our time away from getting carts in too do maintenance work that wasn’t in our description. Then we would get calls for a propane exchange or to help a customer which is understandable. Also at times we gotta take out carts of batteries to the back which weighed a lot if your not as strong. But when you get a call on the radio non stop on a busy day to do carry outs or other sorts, it takes away time from you getting you work done. If you work isn’t done to their expectations, they then would get made that your going to slow. As a cart pusher for 6 months, starting after forth of July till Christmas. As cart pushers, we would get treated like dogs for only getting paid $11 an hour while some people are able to sit around and smoke all day with a higher pay.

"Great stable starting job, mgmt is terrible","There will definitely be a lot of work to do, especially depending on the season. So, you might feel slightly overworked at times. You will be held accountable for your areas worked, so be sure to communicate with your managers.But, some managers are different from others and they can make or break the store or worker morale. Be mindful of that. Also, you literally have to have your managers' personal contact info to get anything resolved. Calling up to the store DOES NOT HELP. They don't answer the phone. HR isn't always there. It's rough if something personal happens to you. You have to jump through hoops.So, if you're there just to get a check and benefits, its great! They even help pay for college after you've worked there for a while.But if your life takes a turn, even if its their fault, don't expect them to accommodate you unless you are buddies with them.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Chicago, IL",9/12/20,2020,9,12

"Great Coworkers, Terrible Everything Else","I have wonderful coworkers but management follow all of us around like we’re children when we’re just trying to work. They don’t care for our health or safety. Whenever I have brought up an issue it’s been ignored multiple times, even when going over the store managers head it’s still ignored. Scheduling is a joke, you barely make enough with the hours you get, but they still expect all of this work to be done. They want nothing less then perfection. We have people coming in sick because they can’t afford to stay home sick, I have been called a liar by a manager because I was on sick leave for COVID and I told him I had seen the doctor prior and had a 101 fever as a precaution before letting me come back to work. Barely anyone wears masks anymore, no one cares, we don’t get hazard pay, it’s a joke. Don’t work for this company, I’m begging you.

Too much stress for a simple job ,"The job itself is easy but management creates such a stressful work environment for people That won’t last longer than a few months. Ive first hand seen managers yell at someone for leaving work to see a dying family member, some of the managers are good the others will run you into the ground and destroy your work ethic and will resort to coaching and not speaking to any of the associates first. favorites are a very big problem among management if they aren’t not close with you then they will not like you. You can and have the ability to move  up that’s not an issue but the issue is they let incompetent people move up before they let the people who do their job and make an effort to do it. If you can deal with high stress you could probably make it but the managers might make it harder for you because they see you as a threat.

Only work in their Health and Wellness Department.,"While I have met a great amount of genuine and incredibly kind associates. The company continues to hire inept, rude and lazy management outside of health and wellness. Nearly every interaction with management outside my department is met with unwillingness to cooperate and a general disregard for the needs of the employee's in our department.

The managers treat their employes with much disrepect and they are rude to customers to.,Walmart is not cool...I would never recommend anyone to work there. Like i said they are mean rude and treat people like they are children. As a cashier I got so many complaints to me about the rude managers. There was tbis 1 incident where I was working on puting to go backs away and all I did was pull out my phone to see what the time was cause my shift was just about over and if course this rude super rude manager saw me told me to get off my phone. And it is not ok for us to be on out phone on the clock period so I said ok no problem then she said yeah no its not ok! Dont let me catch you again. I felt threatened.

Worst place anybody could work,"Managers will avoid you instead of helping you. Management has no idea how to manage and avoid their job requirements the whole time they are there. You can't move up, or around for that matter, and all the managers have inappropriate relations with minors.

Overworked and Underpaid,"You don’t know who your supervisor is, you’re just kinda there and you get pulled to go to different floors and people look at you like you don’t need to be there. People don’t know what their doing. Their rude and vindictive and treat you like a child and or better an inmate. They clock you for everything, bathroom, breaks, lunch. There’s someone literally standing in there for a while and will come back prior to your lunch being over to yell “lunch over” or “break over”. Looking to move up, here? Yea right.

productive,I loved working at walmart but in today's environment the managers really need to be trained on employees feelings and fears. And listen to what they have to say and respond in a respectful way.,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Manager ,"Prairieville, LA",9/10/20,2020,9,10
Fun workplace,"Walmart was like a second home to me. You get to go there, provide the best customer services to great people, while working in a great environment around fellow associates, who u can call family.

It's a great company to work for and always will be.",5,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Fayetteville, NC",9/10/20,2020,9,10
Busy Distribution Center,I was hired for stocking and also did some picking at the Distribution Center. Lots of hours - 50 to 60 a week. Most of the people were OK to work with. My manager was non-existent so I dealt mainly with the leads. The warehouse itself was a mess most of the time. It was all about getting high numbers. If you made suggestions no one listened to you. ,3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Chino, CA",9/10/20,2020,9,10
Advancement ,Without college experience there are certainly changes for advancement within the company just based on preformance.

It’s good for some ,"I would recommend Walmart to those who perhaps are just starting out and need experience or who are in school/have multiple jobs for the flexible scheduling. However I believe they do not pay enough. They pay more than some company’s but less than others and it doesn’t seem fair for the work you do. The best part about the job can also be the worst, it being the people you work with. It can become like a family, I have made many friends there but you can also work with some real bad eggs that can ruin the experience. Management puts a lot of stress on you and it can seem unfair. The benefits are good if you can get enough hours, but good luck depending on the department. I’ve seen them trick multiple people out of full time hours so they can take away their benefits. For those looking for convenience or just somewhere to start or something on the side I would say it’s great, otherwise maybe consider your other options first. ",3,Current Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Woodstock, IL",9/10/20,2020,9,10
Its okay,It can be worse but for the most part there are jobs that are better and there are bosses who you can have who will teach you but what i am learning is if you want to know something yoi will have to ask a peer or just figure it out. Sometimes you get a boss who is amazing but i got one who just does what he does for a check.,3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Fort Wayne, IN",9/10/20,2020,9,10
Don’t waste your time!!!,"I started working at Walmart because a friend got me a job. At first everything was great, my manager was great, I actually liked working there. Then my manager got a promotion and left our department, so we needed a new manager. Well after about three months of playing musical chairs with managers, we finally got our manager assigned to us and he sucks! He’s rude, he’s lazy, he blatantly favorites people, and constantly tells people who are working hard that they’re wasting their time. His favorite worker got to go around peeling stickers off of shopping carts and off of the steel in back, and yet I got yelled at for taking a minute to get a drink of water because I was “standing around doing nothing”. The management here is horrible, it plays off of favoritism. If you’re okay with brown nosing then by all means come and work but for those of you who have self respect, I’ll save you a lot of hardship now. LITERALLY ANY JOB IS BETTER THAN WORKING HERE!",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Ware, MA",9/10/20,2020,9,10
Nobody likes their jobs ,"Everyone is stressed out. They are told to do one thing then told I’m sorry we changed our minds and redo it this way, management don’t have a clue what their doing most of the time and not to mention they want one person to do three peoples jobs so they don’t have to hire anyone else. And when it comes to promoting that’s a joke they already know who they want even if someone else is better for the position. Don’t get me wrong I have been in stores where I have seen the store manager out pushing carts but the west union store I wouldn’t advise going there ",2,Former Employee,Support Manager/Pharmacy Clerk ,"West Union, OH",9/10/20,2020,9,10

Very productive & Very Active,"A typical day for me at Walmart was always different because every day they had me do something different to learn and explore the different areas/department. As i worked at Walmart i learned how to manage a cashier position, how to handle and distribute money,I learned how to unbox and stock shelfs at a fast pace and organized manner. I learned how to be on the look out for any suspicious behavior. I learned how to communicate with my peers and mangers. ",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tucson, AZ",9/10/20,2020,9,10

Tiring and repetitive work,Some management don’t care about what you feel and have to say while other management at the store may like and be nice to you but are forced to do things a specific way because that is how the company is designed top to bottom. Everything is repetitive and it’s always the same stuff just another day. It’s about what you’d expect from the job. ,2,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Grand Rapids, MN",9/9/20,2020,9,9
terrible management,I understand having needs within a workplace but my time in Walmart was spent more worrying about whether I would be promised proper hours or worrying about the impossible standards that were given.,3,Former Employee,Stock Clerk/Sales Associate ,"York, PA",9/9/20,2020,9,9
Good for Retail,"Walmart has some of the best benefits in retail IF you work full time and after so many years. Their new system of pto has really screwed over people that are part time. As you gain almost none, even if you happen to work pretty much full-time hours. You'd best be dedicated full-time over a long period if you want to see anything given back in the way of wanting a vacation. Some managers are flexible and willing to work with you. Ive had almost no problem especially in an overnight position. You also get the benefit of an extra dollar an hour for doing so. Probably the best choice of shift if you're willing to work it. Otherwise the company itself is draining. Constant indecisive changes coming from the top at all times. Often going back and forth between policies with only a change in name. That being said some of the excruciating experiences have all been pretty bonding. While sometimes it seems like a high school, most people you meet are genuinely pleasant to work with. Everyone coming together in misery and accepting we're just human and sometimes things get insane. I heard the new CEO might be doing some great improvements though. So here's to hoping things change.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Cincinnati, OH",9/9/20,2020,9,9

Lots of things to do and learn,"Theres a lot of things you can learn here. It's very hard work, physically, so you're getting a workout the whole time and the company does sense out pretty regular bonuses to their employees, it would be a good place to work if it weren't for the following;-Not accessible to those with mild invisible disabilities, if they cant see it, they dont believe you and wont make accommodations-Managment does not prioritize their employees, they prioritize profit and speed above all things, yes even safety.-Massive amounts of pressure placed on new employees-Lack of communication to new employees about certain expectations and where they currently stand with the company until they either make or break it-Again, very physically taxing, you cannot go at your own pace, they have a pace set for you and if you dont meet those requirements, you're useless to themA few pros though; bonuses, pretty good pay, very stable work schedule, scheduled weeks in advance, access to several apps to help you keep track of how much you've worked, when you work next, and a few other benefits, most employees are friendly and helpful, good exercise.",3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Spokane, WA",9/9/20,2020,9,9
Wide community workplace and many different types of scenarios,"The hardest part of the job would be communication. One manager would tell you to do something one way, then another would walk by and tell you differently so you have to go back and change everything that you just accomplished with that project. On the other side, a skill that i gained form this type of situation would be the ability to adapt to different sets of guidelines and compromise with something in the middle to get a project completed.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Davenport, IA",9/9/20,2020,9,9

Snakes in the grass and puppies run over in the street,"You leave because of the negative people or stay because of the people you get along with. Most employees stay purely out of solidarity, not because they like their jobs or are treated fairly. Upper managers are hit-and-miss when it comes to decency. Don't be surprised when you're expected to stay and work in one area, only to be told to go across the store because it's part of the job only to be yelled at for doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing. Literally talked down to and treated like an idiot because being treated with contempt IS the culture.

Poor management that expects you to work even when you cannot,"The employer has no respect for your schedule. Was hired on knowing that I attend school, and this is a priority of mine. Had management go behind me and change my availability, saying that I could work while I was at school. Had a manager call and yell at me when I explained I couldn’t work, due to being in school.Zero respect from some fellow employees.

A typical day at work,A typical day at Walmart varies for an associate that is secondaries in another location as I do. In the electronics department I start the day when cleaning up any messes such as freight boxes or returns made to the store. I then start to help the team finish the work that needs to be done first to get it finished as quick as possible. Throughout the day I assist customers to their electronic needs.

about working here. Management is unprofessional and favors certain associates ,"Some, not all co workers, were the best thing  about working here.

No fun.,My problems started when I got sick with the flu and was out of work for 8 days. Came back and everything changed.  My manager was cold to me my hours were cut. Even though I'm a full time employee. I always complete my task. Until management started putting me in other departments to help out. One day I was working in Hardware and the person in Sporting Goods called in sick. I was told to work both departments I did the best I could and when I couldn't finish the one Department I was scolded by management. When the manager could have helped out in the department with some of my Freight instead of just walking around and talking to everybody. One day I'm in Sporting Goods Department in not get pulled to go help in toys for 2 hours. Then I go back to Sporting Goods and I didn't get to finish all of my Freight because I was helping out in toys and my manager reprimanded me for that. I never in one day got any words of encouragement from anyone in management in this Walmart.

Higher pay than other local places for same job duties.,"My normal work shift was Tuesday - Friday evenings until around 1:30 AM, in shift duration that gave me some overtime nearly every week despite only being schedule 4 10-hour nights/week, so even without overtime, I got at least 40 hours every 4-night week.Literally my ONLY complaint with the company is how they now refuse to allow me to return to the most recent job I was doing there just because they claim ""ALL employees must be able to regularly handle and move over 60 lbs,"" despite the fact that in the six months I was on the Yard Truck Operator job, the ONLY times I ever had to handle more than 10 - 15 lbs was when they were short-handed inside so had me fill in of the RSR Forklift job where part of that job included having to move up to 80 lb cases of product from almost empty pallets in the pick slots and put them on the full pallet being placed in the pick slot.I honestly think they decided to not allow me to return after my doctor gave me ""Permanent work restrictions"" saying I could only lift 60 lbs from 12 inches to waist height and should have a spinner handle on the trucks I have to drive...  I think they just decided to use their 60 lb lifting requirement to say I couldn't return because that was less expensive than spending the maybe $60 for the spinner handles my doctor said they should install on the Yard Trucks so I and other employees could perform the job with less stress and strain on the yard driver's wrists and hands!!!This site says I still work there and I AM still ""employed ON PAPER"" there, but Walmart DC hasn't allowed me to return to work there - more...",4,Current Employee,Yard Truck/Forklift Operator ,"Mankato, MN",9/9/20,2020,9,9

Most horrifying experience of my life. ,"You might be lucky and get a simple job, you might end up being told to close the entire deli by yourself. Who knows? more like, who cares? not the managers. They will have 5 different associates on the clock to greet customers but give the deli one person to close, clean, sanatize, everything. Never agree to work production. They will take advantage of your willingness to do good work. The better you work, the more you are punished. the longer you work there the more the managers ignore your requests and pleas. I was guarenteed a department change after 6 months then threatened with my job if i was to go beyond my boss's head to get what i deserved.  I left to a lower paying job and was HAPPY.

She will try anything in her power to make you mad on purpose, or to get you fired, such as acting like your the only issue or separating you and another person for no reason, because she believes everything she hears or thinks she's right. She might be nice to you at first, but as soon as word goes around of someone saying one thing bad about you, you'll see. She is the absolute WORST manager I have EVER been in contact with and I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to work with her. On that note, the work is hit or miss if its a lot or not.

Do not work for Walmart pharmacy as a pharmacist! From a current pharmacist.,"Walmart pharmacy has become the worst pharmacy to work for! They are purely profit-driven as illustrated by the metrics they push, which compromises patient care and safety. Their new opioid stewardship policy causes me to get yelled at everyday by customers and doctors because Walmart prohibits me, as a pharmacist, from making my own clinical judgment as to which opioid prescriptions to dispense. Over the past year or so, Walmart has cut pharmacist hours by 30% and technician hours by 30%. Because of this Walmart has an extremely hard time keeping technicians resulting in always being understaffed in the pharmacy. This causes extreme stress everyday and compromises patient safety, not to mention putting my license at risk every day. Every Walmart pharmacies that I have worked at since being in the company, the store management is resentful to the pharmacy employees because they feel that we make too much money. As a result there is little to no support from store management. this makes pharmacy operations very difficult, especially for the pharmacy manager. I could go on, but I will just give you this advice: do not work for Walmart pharmacy as a pharmacist unless this is the only job you can get.",1,Current Employee,Pharmacy Manager/PIC ,Not disclosed,9/7/20,2020,9,7

Awful management and work environment ,Management doesn’t have a clue what the team actually does. I’m on cap 2 and it’s an horrifying working environment. The conditions aren’t that bad it’s just a toxic environment filled with nepotism lazy workers that get praised for carrying the team. It’s shocking and disturbing what goes on there. Managers pick favorites based on who they like not who actually works hard and those people that they pick then get to do literally whatever they want and get away with it. They let them take breaks twice as long as they’re allowed while the rest of us get railed if we accidentally go a minute or two over our time. The few good ones they hire have to carry the team while getting mistreated by management. When we get tired and have a bit of an off day they pull us in the office and yell at us for not finishing our work or just not finishing it as fast as usual. Managers pick people to watch in camera just looking for a reason to get them in trouble while they ignore others that do the same things just as often or even more. Oh and they cheat us out of money constantly. They literally only paid me $9 per hour for the first year and a half I worked there when I was told I was making $11. I downloaded the even app which shows us how much we make every day and mysteriously my pay jumped up the day after I downloaded it.

The company needs more oversight of it's store operations ,"The company as a whole has a great culture and values, but with upper management not being put in check that culture and those values go right out the window and into an active volcano. Corporate needs to have a more active role interacting with their associates instead of following that chain of command junk. When all of your management team at a certain store is not adhering to the company's morals and values then associates would be more confident in reporting concerns and feel like a market team would be more approachable especially if they were there to provideoversightof it'smanagementteam. I'm honestly surprised no acts of violence, chaos, or anarchy had fallen unto that store yet considering it and it's management mismanages it's people and products to the point that you can see for yourself that it's a garbage store.

The hours are great they have great family programs its a great place to work over all.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate Tire and Lube ,"Lexington, KY",9/7/20,2020,9,7
Working for walmart ,When you work for walmart you can always rely on your co worker take care of you on your first day. I know your thinking I dont need that but it actually is very important to feel welcome when starting at a company. Other than that the managers are friendly and firm on what they want done for the night and never get frustrated with you. They want you to complete your task and help others if possible so we all complete what we need to be finished. The pay is also really good for start but not a lot of potential for raises.,4,Current Employee,Maintenance ,"Denison, TX",9/7/20,2020,9,7
Poor communication ,"I’ve been with Walmart for 6 years and I’ve gained nothing there. Mangers have no communication, micro mange’s to much. I was only making 11.50 an hour and there was people being hired in making almost 13 an hour. The ones that was getting paid more wouldn’t work hard and would constantly disappear to the bathroom every 20 mins, but the only people who get yelled at to work harder and go faster is the workers who work their butts off. (They work you roll your drained then yells at you for being exhausted) They don’t care if your sick, they don’t care if your child is in the hospital sick, they don’t accept doctor notes. I don’t see how I lasted 6 years there. I seen Walmart go from being so great with loving mangers to mangers who only cares about themselves and become toxic. Mangers will literally go to another associate and talk about the other associates all day. Bad management makes GOOD associates quit. And that’s what happened to many of us. It’s a shame, cause so many of us quit cause we was so fed up. My whole team told the store manger about the stuff out manger was doing (40) associates by the way, and they did nothing. They shrug our concerns of their shoulders. I used to love working for Walmart. ",1,Former Employee,Walmart personal shopper ,"Wadsworth, OH",9/7/20,2020,9,7

Positive and Hard Working Work Environment ,I love working for Wal-Mart and have been with the company almost 5 years. They are very strict on us especially the Cap Teams but most of the time it's a very upbeat and positive work environment.

Very bad!,Start with the managers only 2 managers who care about associates out of 8. All seem to be worried about looking not doing good. EX] Cap 2 was told we were doing bad and if we didnt do better we would get fired because we are all replacedable. Move on to coworkers 70% can't do or don't care to do their job. Other 30% work hard just to get fustrated and mental exhausted. Move on to pay Cap 2 should be split in two because right now have a truck team and then a stocking team that get paid the same. Which from someone who has had to unload it is very phyiscally demanding and very strict on the time. Told we are one big team but everyone blames the next person and could careless to actually deal with the issues at hand.,2,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Hermitage, PA",9/7/20,2020,9,7

"If you are salaried, you will be working 60+ hours. Management always there for you but only to make sure you are fully stressed. ","I worked for this company for 6 years and found it hard to understand how people last 20-30 years in this company without wanting to tear all their hair out. My experiences as an hourly employee were not bad, however they tend to flip a switch once you promote and go salaried. They stop caring about you as a person and only care about results and don’t care how you get them or how far out of reach they might be for you and your team. You will work easily 60+ hours a week and make the same pay. You will also get to see your boss and other managers doing much less work than you, talking and sitting in the backroom office on a constant basis meanwhile you sweat your tushie off to maintain the store. The pay is great for the job and no other retailer can compete as far as compensation goes, at least as a salaried manager but it often seems that you aren’t paid enough when you see all the stress you have to face along with workplace politics and favoritism ",3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Frisco, CO",9/6/20,2020,9,6

It's usually mundane work but you learn a lot of important skills, including socializing, especially with customers, which is important in many career fields.

They will run you into the ground until you can’t handle it anymore, I’ve seen it countless time. They’re favorite slogan is “everyone is just a number” and “I could replace you in a day” The store is ALWAYS understaffed but they expect everyone to finish every night when sometimes it’s simply not possible.

Former Cap 2 Associate,"The pay was alright, although there was more pay for slower paced positions. From my experience, i would not recommend the backroom positions by any means. If you're going to apply for Walmart, apply for the sales floor positions instead. You would get treated better, and not get rushed to finish your task in unrealistic timelines, wouldn't get threatened to be fired if you don't work faster and just in general have a better work experience. Doubt they'll change the way managers treat Cap 2 associates and backroom associates anytime soon. Till then, Stay Away from applying to any backroom position.",2,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Long Beach, CA",9/5/20,2020,9,5

"Good Starter Job, Stressfull Workplace","The job is clear and easy to get into if you pay attention during training, however it can be Stressfull for anyone who can't handle the stressful nature of customer service.

Micromanager and Harassment,"I worked nightshift at St Robert Missouri. Nightshirt here is toxic. I used to sit in my car at breaks. One night, when the manager was off, I heard all the girls gossiping and making fun of someone with back problems. I find that unacceptable. If a colleague has back problems, why laugh and joke about it? Is it funny if I laugh and joke about your problems? The assistant manager constantly micromanaged and harassed all night long. I worked in frozen and dairy. One night Courtney would tell us that it is ok to unload two pallets of frozen foods (over or around 6ft high pallets). It was ok to leave these frozen foods out of the freezer over our break. So, frozen foods, under Courtney's watch, could be left out for over 2 hours. The week later this would change. Only dairy could be out for 15 minutes BUT if it was overstock (too much to place on the shelf) then it could stay out until break or lunch(about 2 hours). So food that is placed in the fridges must be placed in within 15 minutes, but excess can be left for hours? What kind of idiot? Yum , yum, yum. The constant harassment, bullying, and disregard to human respect was too much. Plus, when you inform management of an availability change, don't expect that to last. I have university classes Monday and Tuesday. The change of schedule lasted 3 weeks. That helps no one. Stay away from nightshift St Robert. You're life will be made terrible by a bullying micromanager, and you will witness disgusting health and safety practices. ",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"St. Robert, MO",9/5/20,2020,9,5

Worst company ever - don’t recommend unless you’re desperate,"I worked at this company for 13 years and at the end of those years made less than a new hire department manager. Raises are .10 - .25 cents a year and don’t expect .25 unless your review in an exceeds expectations. And they’re only allotted so many “exceeds” at each store! When I joined it had a family atmosphere and I was proud of my job. When I quit it was completely different. You are always replaceable! Managers love to bully and harass you into doing 2 jobs as 1 person. My final straw was when a parent passed away and HR ‘forgot’ to put in my bereavement pay and personal hours. I told them I was a single mom and needed the money to pay my rent. Managements response? “Well, if you get evicted at least you have 30 days!” Would give 0 stars if I could.

I was supposed to receive a promotion to the money center, as I’m a cashier, but the old ladies I work with conspired against me and now I don’t have that opportunity anymore.

The communism of retail,"I called this the communism  of retail because their policies and the way they run things in general are awesome....on paper. Unfortunately, like communism, a job at Walmart can only be as good as the people in charge. Walmart as a company  seems to be  notorious for  hiring and promoting incompetent people into management.  Many places have this weakness, but we are talking about Walmart in particular in this case. Also like communism, Walmart has a glaring weakness in the sense that it is ironically very suspect to corruption at the higher levels, which always ends up being detrimental to the organization as a whole. And for some odd reason they tend to keep those people there despite their incompetence as a manager being blatantly obvious, probably because it would be too costly to have to continuously pay to train people until you find the right fit. While I understand that logic, let me ask you this; what should be more important to Walmart? Their wallets or their people? At the end of the day, which one do they truly need more? Taking care of which one will produce the most profit in the long run? It seems the bigwigs of this company have gotten complacent and content, they don't keep an eye on their stores like they probably should. I know it's been said a million times, but Sam Walton would be rolling over in his grave if he saw what happened to his brainchild.",2,Current Employee,Sporting Goods Sales Associate ,"Farmville, VA",9/4/20,2020,9,4

Managers did not have professional training to be of assistance when needed to figure out complicated issue with equipment.  There was zero assistance from managers to assist me in advancing any further in the company.  Was black listed from management because I spoke out against a change in policy.

Day in the life at walmart,Start of the day is always using the pallet jack to bring all the pallets to the floor. then we set up the line and connect it to the end of the truck. one person goes in the truck and puts the freight on the line. the rest of the employees put the freight on the pallets. We then go on brake. after brake we bring the freight to the correct departments. Management is usually dealing with claims or customers. Workplace culture is mostly good nice people.

Keep to yourself and you'll be fine.,"The job is straightforward, albeit, sometimes made more difficult by the multitude of tasks given at once by supervisors and salaried management. Do not feel pressured to do everything that is asked of you, simply do what you can, stay out of trouble and drama, and you should be fine. However, this advice may not apply when stepping up from a regular associate to a department manager or supervisor. There are incredibly high expectations and pressure that far exceed the pay for those jobs. Management will feel more compelled to keep pushing the issue even when the store is understaffed and the workload is too big. The co-workers are nice people for the most part. Made some decent friends along the way. Do expect a lot of high school gossip and cliques along with favoritism from management. This was honestly to be expected when I began, to the new employees out there about to begin, don't expect anything different at your store.Once you become a full-time employee, getting a set schedule can be rather easy after about three months or so of good attendance and work ethic. Achieving full-time status is a different story. Even with good attendance and work ethic, don't be surprised to hear several reasons why you can't get it. This can range from there not being enough hours to give, being told that you are not ready for full-time, or that they would rather hire part-time employees.To any new hires out there reading this, Walmart is rather predictable. Co-workers can vary in backgrounds, but for the most part, are mostly immature but friendly people.

"It's a big name corporation, but that's it.","You'd think that a such a big company like Walmart would afford the very best for its customers and employees, but that's the stuff dreams are made of. You know how dedicated Walmart claims to be towards saving money for customers? Well, the company sure doesn't lie about its dedication to affordability; it's even cheaper to its employees. It's not bad enough that Walmart doesn't care a hoot about its employees; the management and higher ups at the company are no better. Granted, there's at least one or two who are very fair and caring, but there's major favoritism and unfairness going on in each and every location.For example, there was a female manager whom I complained to about the favoritism that occurred behind employees' backs and when the employees were taken advantage by some higher ups. This female manager told me, in her own words, “There's a lot of favoritism that occurs here. Some people take advantage of this. You can be friends at home, but not at work.”Less than a week later, the same manager was hanging out with the very employee who was taking advantage of her closeness and friendship with the higher ups. The manager took that employee and another out for lunch and the relationship between them got chummy pretty quick. I just wanted to eyeroll so bad at the hypocrisy of the management team.And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Sometimes we are treated even worse than the customers, just because the managers personally know the customers and take more into their accounts.

It's Walmart,"I worked for Walmart for over a year. I started off as a regular sales associate. From the jump, I felt as though I was under-trained. The personnel coordinator was on vacation when I originally got hired, so they pulled a random lady from another store do conduct our orientation. The orientation lady did not share pretty much any information, help us set up direct deposit or talk to us about setting up 401k/investing in Walmart stock. This, in turn, caused me to rack up some points on my attendance sheet. She never told us that we could only clock in 9 minutes early/nine minutes late without being pointed. I was clocking in 10 minutes early and getting points for it! I wouldn't have been so upset had I been informed the first time I did it. No! They waited until I was at 4 points (5 gets you fired) to tell me about it and they weren't willing to take some of them off even after I explained the miscommunication. I will say, however, it is pretty easy to advance as department manager jobs open pretty regularly and as long as you're not a horrible associate, you'll more than likely have a fighting chance of getting the job. I did get promoted to a  department manager less than 6 months after being at Walmart. I was excited to climb the ranks, but I don't feel that the pay increase was fair for the amount of work that increased when I took the promotion. I went from basically just stocking shelves and helping customers to dealing with organizing my backroom, keeping up with inventory counts, doing weekly assignments, running leftover freight, helping in OGP when they needed it, - more...",2,Former Employee,Dairy Department Manager ,"Oak Grove, KY",9/1/20,2020,9,1

Very Stressful Job at the Warehouse,"The job at Walmart's Distribution Center can sometimes be ok depending on how much freight is going through daily. Most of the time, the job can become very stressful as managers are forcing you to make numbers with no consistency from other departments. There is no communication between the managers and employees and there is a lot of conflict that appears at times throughout the warehouse from employees being mistreated. Some parts about it are good like working 12-Hour days for only 3 days on one shift or working 4 days for 11 hours and at least getting a few days off constantly throughout the week. Unfortunately, the work is very stressful, you only get two 20 minute breaks between 4 hours, and also work on holidays with no bonuses. The only added compensation are incentives that are dependable among the warehouse's made productivity every quarter. I've done a lot of stressful work related things before but with guidance on getting the tasks done, not being able to handle the work with problems happening around me consecutively.

Simple Positions and Good Communication,"I was manly stuck outside pushing shopping carts. Getting paid $11 an hour was pretty good for my first job, and just to push shopping carts.

The CSM's were also really nice to work with and sometimes supper helpful.",4,Former Employee,Cart Associate ,"Wichita, KS",9/1/20,2020,9,1
Toxic work environment,"The managers here will expect you to do the job of two or three people in a single shift. I was a fresh produce associate and I regularly had to work in multiple departments simultaneously even on our busiest days. The management would get mad at you for not completing the work of three people, but they refused to hire more workers for my area. (Even while the store was making record high profits during the covid-19 panic). If one person got sick and called out it was always me who had to pick up the slack. There wasn't much room for advancement either. Managers were hired based on favoritism and not actual managerial skills. There was a Dept Manager position open in my area and they wouldn't even give me an interview for it even though I was their best worker. They gave the position to someone who had never worked in that area and I basically had to teach them how to do their job. She was probably the best manager I had but that doesn't make up for the fact that I should have had her position.Overall this company handled covid-19 pretty horribly. The thermometers they used to temp us regularly temped extremely low and were very inaccurate. They gave us one $300 bonus in April but no other hazard pay. They didn't even make the employees or customers wear masks until the local government forced it.Needless to say I don't recommend working here.",2,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 2 Associate ,Michigan,9/1/20,2020,9,1

Well I did my time,"That's what it felt like. The work experience was really ruined by those few bad apples who had it out for me the minute I started. It was also ruined by COVID. Even though you try your best, work hard, and can do everything they ask without complaint no one respected each other. The customers had no respect for the employees and the management had no respect for the employees. If you need a job right now then it'll help but be prepared to be let go because of favoritism and clicky attitudes. If you go to work to work instead of make friends then be prepared to have a short employment. I was always polite and cordial but I would take my breaks outside or at home but it was never enough.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Waycross, GA",9/1/20,2020,9,1

It's not the worst job out there. It's easy to get hired, and if you're lucky and work with nice people or get a good manager, it's a bearable. But it has all the classic trappings of most retail jobs.I've worked at multiple locations and multiple departments, and all of them have been overall negative experiences. Most managers do not care or are frequently rude, the workload is always high and the time short, they will hire anyone and everyone even if they are bad workers, and the customers that come to Walmart tend to be the worst that I've dealt with in my retail experience.

"Stressful, everyone leaves work for others to do, managers don't care if you need help","Since working in this store, I have seen high turnover because management does not take care of serious situations like physical harassment, bullying, and racism. There is never enough time to get all of your work done because overnights leave their stuff for day time associates to finish, so you do their work and part of yours, only to get in trouble for not completing your own tasks. (Even after being told to do overnight leftovers first) Everything is unorganized and the store is a mess because half of the people just don't care enough. Customers are constantly being rude and you're expected to just deal with it and help them. There is a no retaliation policy but managers retaliate when they are reported. The store manager is hard to talk to, he talks down to women and definitely treats men better. No doubt about it. Lots of favoritism from the managers. It also takes up to 20 minutes to get a manager when a problem with a customer arises because they would rather sit on Facebook on their phones in the office.",2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Superior, WI",8/31/20,2020,8,31

Not Worth Working Here,Working here was awful. It exacerbated my anxiety and depression. I think the job was pointless. I didn't feel fulfilled by what I did. I helped stop countless shoplifters but was never praised for it or officially recognized. Supervisors would yell at you and tell you you're worthless and stupid. Especially during Black Friday. The pay was great for doing basically nothing. The hardest part was pretending to be happy and actually care about the customers. The customers are the worst. The most enjoyable part was leaving to go home. Management would bully you into working later than you wanted to. And the culture? So much gossiping and rumor-spreading. Just like high school. ,2,Former Employee,Self Checkout Host ,"San Benito, TX",8/31/20,2020,8,31

Often you are expected to take on the workload of 2 or 3 other people by yourself and expectations for those tasks are constantly changing.  It's exhausting, leaving little time or energy for a balanced life outside of work and, especially in a management position, scheduling is either so inflexible or inconstant that it leaves little hope of regaining it.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Ames, IA",8/31/20,2020,8,31

my experience with Walmart ,When I first started working there I really enjoyed it. Then as the years went on we had certain managers that talk down to associates and treat them like they didn't matter. The managers were often if not most always sitting in the office talking and laughing while the employees done everything then when our market manager came in if we had a bad walk through the managers would blame the associates when they never really set out clear instructions just fussed all the time.,2,Current Employee,Ship from Store Associate ,"Reidsville, NC",8/31/20,2020,8,31

Outrageously terrible management,"Store #249 Cleveland, Texas has got to be the worst store ever. This store has a tremendously high turnover rate on the management team. i have worked at this store 2 times and another in Georgia since 2015. I have to say that any issues that you have with anybody you work with, a customer, or personal issues such as scheduling, vacation, injury, etc. they will guilt trip you, they will not adhere to your concerns. If you call corporate or ethics, nothing is done about anything even if it is serious. now if you have been promoted to management, you better have paper copy documents proving that you were in that position because once you apply for something, such as; loans, applications for another job, etc. they will not have it in the system that you ever were a manager or had any type of supervisor position. the owner of the store is African American at the time named Aaron Wellington and he proves to not follow guidelines, and has talked trash about the store and the associates, and customers. He is 100% racist and shows it but nothing is done about it. If you are needing to transfer he will leave it sitting in his computer for weeks even after you talk to him about it. its a chain of events; bad owner, bad assistants, bad associates. At this store in particular, no body can take pride in what they do and there are favorites because they are all in their own clicks that are alright with gossiping and slandering.",1,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Cleveland, TX",8/31/20,2020,8,31
Walmart,Walmart is a great place to work and they have outstanding benefits.

Easy enough work if you keep a decent pace. Worst part of the job is finishing all of your work quickly and having to stay productive and seek work elsewhere with others.

Run away!  Terrible place to work,"The good - They allow you to purchase items with a twenty percent off discount once a year for Christmas.  The pay is so low that this seems like adding salt to a wound.  I really don't have much good to say about the company.  Every four months, you might get a $100 bonus if the manager doesn't use the money to paint his office or buy new equipment for the store something.The bad - Management hides in their offices all day.  You never know who your boss is.  Training is a joke.  Some customers are very rude, and supervisors and management reward them for their behavior.People who have worked there for years, even a decade or more, may find out that the new hires that they are training are being hired in at a higher starting wage than they worked so hard to build up.Insurance sucked.  I paid about a hundred dollars a month for it, and still had bills for hundreds-of-dollars any time I went to the doctor for routine visits.  And remember that pay sucked too, so it was very difficult to pay these bills.They find ways to make it seem like they are giving employees something, when they are actually taking away benefits.Computers and devices often do not work right, and the customers get irate when you can't do your job to help them.I could go on and on.

Unfortunately, a lot of people slip through the cracks and become members of management through relationships as opposed to work ethic. This, unfortunately is inevitable regardless of the location that you work in and almost always occurs. Being AP is probably the best job within Wal-Mart because of the freedom you have. A lot of times, I chose when my breaks and lunches where and each day I was able to pretty much make my own schedule (this was because my AP manager didn't micromanage me because she knew I did my job).

a decent part time job ,"A typical day at work would be going to the lawn and garden section and watering the plants and putting away any sort of stock that had anything to do with lawn and garden. Then once I am finished with that, I would go find something else to do. I learned that there's always something to do at a job and to make the most of your time by being productive.

If you call them over to help they will either take too long or ignore you. Most people get promoted as CSMs only for kissing up and being friendly with the other mangers.

This can be good if you need a job soon, but I didn't get paid until 16 days after I first worked, so do not expect to be earning straight away. I worked full time in almost every department in the store aside from the only one I had applied to work. I was given very little relevant training before being asked to work. I was working inventory management, cleaning shelves, changing and rearranging the store, stocking inventory, organizing aisles, and dealing with customer returns and damaged products while constantly assisting customers in finding items, even while off the clock. I was also given no tools to work with and I often struggled to even find a cart to use to move inventory. I regularly did not have time to take my breaks and my body was ruined every single day. I also did not have a very fixed schedule despite working full time and it felt like I was almost always at work. Despite everything I was doing, I only made $60/day after tax working 9 hour shifts. I also was not allowed to get any overtime under any circumstances. On top of all of that I was never given an official place at the company and held onto as a ""temp employee"" so that way I had literally no benefits, could be fired at any time, and could not do anything about it. I didn't even get an employee discount or any of the quarterly bonus which was determined by the performance of the store which I basically ran.

I am the only one out of her children that is still there and working.  I struggle with a lot of the social interactions of customers and other associates because I have mild learning issues. I have some managers that understand that I have a hard time with things. I have some managers that do not. That is why I say Walmart is just a pay check.

"If you have the choice, stay away","The management have a habit of making you feel like you're doing amazing when you first start, they feel welcoming and encouraging, but after a month or two they turn on you. Nothing you do is right, they interrogate you in front of customers, they refuse to listen to complaints/suggestions, and even going to Ethics doesn't work. I've personally been given wrong information on purpose so they could use me more instead of me being able to take the time off so I could be better at work. There are a few rays of hope in 1876 specifically, such as a few CSM's and the People Lead, but the rest of management is a nightmare to work with. I've witnessed management degrade associates on the sales floor, they bring minors into the back to reprimand them about things management 100% should NOT be reprimanding them for. They mistreat their employees by underpayment them and forcing them to take on responsibilities that aren't theirs to begin with, and then tell them they aren't doing enough. During Covid, management has made statements about coming in anyway because ""you've already infected us all if you're sick"", they give very little in compensation pay, and they don't give times/days that a sick coworker that has been quarantined worked. They expect everyone to do everything for base wages. Even if you go above and beyond for them you'll still be considered unreliable, a non-team player, and you'll get in trouble for the littlest things that go wrong, even if it isn't your department, or your job, to do that thing.

Also because of COVID19 their demand is higher so you have to work 55 hours a week. They will make us work 66 hours per week during holiday time. Must work on Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve without getting paid time and a half. The attendance policies have changed and they couldn't care less about a good family life work life balance.

Benifits and Pay,Wal-Mart was a fun and most of the time easy job. Some days were a little hectic but you should expect that in a busy company whether it be the work or customers.

Job was great but the employees weren't. ,"I actually enjoyed my time in this company but it ended shortly after i reported an incident, I reported it to management (who is required to remain confidential)  However, word quickly spread and I was treated differently until the store manager forced me out of the position. The job itself is easier if management had the right amount of people working certain areas, instead they work individuals until they break down and quit and continue that cycle, they pick and choose who they want to train to qualify for certain positions. Management can literally be anyone, and most of them are uneducated and extremely unprofessional.

"miserable, exploitative, hostile environment ","Job was to stock fresh items in dairy and grocery.  First problem, you need a scanner to read bar codes on products  which tells you where exactly to put the stuff.  However, they have limited number of scanners, so they give you the opportunity to put an app on your personal phone that will let you do this.  However, in my case, and evidently this is a ""known issue"" with others as well, the app doesn't load properly.  So you  have no tools to work with. But shift supervisor still is on your back to hurry up and stock things.  Hello, I'm doing my best. You have to look at all the tags in the target area to find the proper place to put it.  This takes time, especially with your glasses off due to fogging from mask.  H*ll Hole.  Am trying to stick it out because I have history of ""job jumping"", but am on my last legs.  It gets better as you become familiar with a particular aisle, but there are always things you haven't seen before. One manager isn't so bad, but the other is trying to make an impression evidently.

Good and bad,I felt that the women of Walmart always worked harder than the men but are paid significantly less for some reason.  A lot of people get away with slacking off and the hardworking people are never appreciated. They give lots of bonuses and benefits discounts so that's an up side and you can move around and experience different positions so that's also great.

Used to be a decent place to work,"When I started at Walmart there was a sense of teamwork and even enjoyment to start the day. It was a job that made you feel as if your input and hard work mattered. As a Department manager I was able to set standards as to how things looked in my area and I took pride in making the area look nice. That was less than a year ago. Things have changed dramatically as of late and yes Covid19 is a part of that but certainly not the main culprit. It is, put simply, corporate greed at its finest. Walmart has recently decided to eliminate the department manager position in some of its markets if not all of them eventually and my store is one of the chosen. It remains to be seen rather or not they will reduce hourly wages for the soon to be former department managers. As a whole we are underpaid and overworked, staffing retention reflects this clearly. The end result will of course be better corporate profits at the cost of the worker. Need I even mention the ridiculous profits that Walmart already makes!! Meanwhile the now department managers will be relegated back to stocking the shelves with no vested interest or pride in what was their little piece of the store.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Denver, CO",8/25/20,2020,8,25

"Accessible Opportunities for Advancement, but highly demanding workloads at certain stores.","Walmart has seen many improvements over the years offering competitive wages, many opportunities for advancement, and extending additional benefits to employees. The average day for most hourly employees is entirely focused on working with the customer often times pulling you out of your dedicated positions, especially on the sales floor. As with any department store, management will always be different from location to location, but generally with Walmart managers are at least encouraged to work with their associates to provide a flexible and multi-skilled workforce.",4,Former Employee,Connection Center & Photo Center Department Manager ,"Marysville, WA",8/25/20,2020,8,25
Diverse and well managed work place,"A typical work day is working on cars in a quick-safe manner within an hour minimum. The workplace is positive & energized. Hardest part is how stressful the environment can be, for example, how much oil changes and tire jobs are assigned with how low staffed it is on most days. What I learned from working with Walmart is I'm great working with others, I ask for help when I'm struggling or don't know what's being asked of me, and I try to help customers out to the best of my ability on where to find items in the store or online.

Great company to work for but horrible management ,"When I started a few years ago, I loved working at Walmart, but it only took about 9 months for that to go down the drain. The old store manager left and a few other ASMs and we got left with, for the most part, a pretty lousy and arrogant management team. As understaffed as this store is and has been FOREVER, and managers that refuse to understand the problem solving process, this store is truly a toxic workplace. Also, I wish anyone luck moving up past a DM role, it will never happen unless you’re one of the store managers favorite little flying monkeys, and she rarely finds people she likes.",2,Current Employee, Department Manager  ,"Fredericksburg, TX",8/25/20,2020,8,25
Okay,"This Walmart had a bad sense of employment.Some people where nice and helpful, but the upper management ignore the responsibility of there jobs and only made themselves look good when it really mattered. The responsibility of an assembler gifted me the knowledge of how there business ran and who strived and pulled themselves through everything during their shifts.

Upper management is a joke. No one said anything about dress code in my orientation and waited 2 months into me working there to say something to me about my pants. Really no good training my trainer on my first day called our coworkers stupid and some other rude things and when I brought it up to the manager all he said to me was well I told you it was going to be stressful didn’t I.

Management is the main source of Conspiracy.,Would not recommend anybody to work for Wal-Mart. The Managers lie and use you for you abilities and never promote you. The team members fight over head positions that they never come to see. The Management lie about paying benefits; when it’s time for you to get a raise knowing you have reached that goal from a qualified stand point. They want allow you to take sick days or call outs; which is why they implemented a “Point Scale” system; so even if you are sick or have a personal matter to attend too; you could potentially get fired because of that rigged system they’ve put in place..I could write a book about Wal-Mart an how they treat there employees is just Nefarious.,1,Current Employee,Stocker/Unloader ,"Valdosta, GA",8/24/20,2020,8,24

decent work,"im currently doing overnight stocking. And to be honest the work is fairly easy. The problem is management makes the job harder than it needs to be. I know its a cliché to say this about most jobs but walmarts management team is just an odd bunch. My recommendation is to not go into this job with high expectations. At this point with covid they are not offering overtime. And don't expect to be full or part time here. They're hiring, but only hiring temporary workers.

Upper management holds grudges and tried to bend the rules to get their way.,"Most managers are unprofessional people who only got there from being friends with certain people. They don't care about their associates, and the work is repetitive. The pay is average and the benefits are even more average. You're just a number to them and at the end of the day, they'll throw you under the bus before they take blame themselves. Luckily none of this happened to me, but after watching it happen to friends of mine I brought it up and they tried to hide it. Shortly after I decided to quit because I'd rather work for less and be respected than to be treated like another number. ",1,Former Employee,Online Grocery Associate ,"Abilene, TX",8/24/20,2020,8,24
All Around Horrible,"The pay was decent and at least they have an overnight differential, but the managers pushed the hard workers to work even harder. They made us feel like they were going to fire us at any moment, but would let the lazy workers slack off constantly. I worked with two people who would #2 themselves at the register every other night. The managers said they couldn't do anything about it. One of them finally quit and the other was fired eventually for stealing from the register.We always had a theft problem, but the new policy said that the only way we could call a theif out was to call a manager over to follow them around. If the manager lost sight of them for even a second, they couldn't do anything because ""What if the theif put the item back when you weren't looking?"" Now, they have security guards posted at the front, but they're only there to deter thieves with a uniform. They can't actually do anything. One security guard sits at the door on the way in the remind people that they have to wear a mask, but he doesn't even do that. When this was mentioned to a manager, they said that they're supposed to ask the customers to wear them but corporate doesn't allow them to enforce the mask policy despite it being state law now.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Cashier ,"Eagan, MN",8/24/20,2020,8,24
Terrible place ,I would say this Walmart is a terrible  place to work at but it’s a job. A lot of people have been working there forever so they formed cliques And it feels like high school honestly.

Lying Managers. Poor Working Conditions. Poor Pay.,"I started working at Walmart as an overnight Employee and then became a CAP 2 Associate. The people that you work with (not including management) are the only reason why i still work there. The pay is terrible, $13 an hour. We were supposed to get a $1 raise but never got it. Other locations did in our area but not us. Working conditions are terrible. They do not provide you with equipment that’s suitable to get the job done properly or efficiently. The conveyor line is always breaking down, and doesnt sort properly. The backroom doesnt have enough room for the amount of freight they purchase, and the crew who unloads the truck is poorly managed and treated like dogs. They will make you get in a 115 degree truck day after day, most days we have two trucks (each averaging 2400 pieces) and management doesnt care if your back hurts from constant work overload. Management is two faced, and lie constantly. They focus primarily on the high achievers in that, they only watch them on the cameras instead of the associates they really should be watching (people who walk around all day or bad performers). I was told i would get a Supervisor position and had me cover the Supervisors role for a month and a half, and then they hired someone else from a different department who didnt remotely know the job that well. Management always tells you “you are the backbone of the workplace” but then turn around, treat you like garbage the same day and talk down to you when job requirements arent met (mostly for the fact that we cant perform well because we arent given the proper resources).

The store is highly unorganized. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet all day, the rude customers on top of the rude managers, managers forgetting to give you your break.

It was a fun place to work,The managers need to do a better job of helping there employees and when being called its there job to answer instead of ignoring they also need work on giving out breaks on time and when its time for people to go they act like they dont have anybody to relieve yall,5,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Charlottesville, VA",8/23/20,2020,8,23

American sweatshop,Walmart has only a hand full of skilled managers in place. the others are peoples friends and family with no management skills. The store is racist and the bully their employees.

Fun work environment just doesn't pay well.,I've loved working here at Walmart but I've always been the hardest worker at work amd feel as though for hard labor work Walmart doesn't pay well for that aspect. I love working at Walmart though. One more thing all managers and workers rank being a cart Attendant is the lowest job.,5,Former Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Marysville, CA",8/23/20,2020,8,23
Bad Management ,It’s a fair store to work at but the people you work with are disrespectful and the managers don’t care if you need a schedule change or a day off and I just had my son 4 days ago and I told my mangers 3 weeks prior to him being born that I need my schedule changed due to that and nobody ever did anything and they don’t care. They just tell me they’ll look at it and do something to it but yet I’m still working a schedule that is not suitable for me and my child.,3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Sales Associate ,"Louisville, KY ",8/23/20,2020,8,23

Great first job ,Walmart is a multi million dollar company. $11.00 a hour is not enough money. Management don't get to know you.. They lack communication. I have a full time job and they wanted to schedule me crazy hour without communication.. When I went to speak with my front end coach she said oh they wanted me who is they you over the front end.. Nobody take accountability for their actions... If it wasn't for that I would still be there but I like working in structure and having great communication,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Charlotte, NC",8/23/20,2020,8,23
My store Managers were very rude and want respect but don't give it back!,I did not enjoy working at Walmart. My department was toxic and full of cursing and yelling. I could say more but I wouldn't be able to fit it all in this box. ,1,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"San Angelo, TX",8/23/20,2020,8,23
Productive and overwhelming work place environment ,"As over night stocker stocker and we are the underdogs of the shift. In Walmart you have cap team 1 and cap team 2 and then there’s over nights. I say we are the underdogs because we get our stuff done and more but don’t get the appreciation that we deserve. We have to do our task and what ever cap 2 doesn’t get done because there is no one putting their foot down on the associates and they pretty much get away with not finishing their freight but if it was overnights we’d be getting in trouble for not being about to to finish 8 hour time frame in a 5 hour time frame. I saw 5 hour time fame because we get to work I counted oo ur breaks and time we have to zone and we loose about 3 hour of time to stock freight so we really get 5 hours to stock from our 8 hour shift  our task and it doesn’t help that some night we have to pick up the slack of an other team. The management is great they work with you to make sure you are getting the hours you need. Willingness to help you out with going do different shift, different hours, going per time going full time, etc I didn’t have a good time working their but I want to say that was cause of the position I was in. I tried switching positions but they talked about it and are just talking g to long to switch positions.",5,Current Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Moses Lake, WA",8/23/20,2020,8,23

"Horrible place to work, awful management.",I asked for help from management multiple times and had no help for 6 month which tanked my performance at work and eventually got me fired. So if your looking for a job it's a good first job but definitely not a career path I recommend unless you like being buddy buddy with the CEO.,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Shelton, WA",8/23/20,2020,8,23
An okay place to work,It's a higher paying entry level job for the area. There are definitely favorites being played. Benefits for full time are decent. There is no holiday pay. The company did not provide hazard pay throughout covid-19 pandemic. Just received a small bonus which wouldn't have added up to the amount we would have gotten with hazard pay. ,3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Murray, KY",8/23/20,2020,8,23
Good flexible hours ,I personally worked the weekend shift and it was nice to only work three days a week but those days can range from 9 to 15 hours.

Potential for growth,"● OverallWalmart is a great place to work,  if you want to succeed you will, meaning if you want to promote you will be supported and given the opportunity to show what you can do.

"Work hard, ask questions, and you could move up ","The ideal culture of Wal-mart is great: Respect for the individual , Customer service, and Strive for excellence , however it is only a feel good culture, and not a reality. I have only worked for one retail company, but I can imagine that they are mostly the same, cut cost to increase the bottom line in order to make the share holders happy. The biggest con for working at Wal-mart is if the job calls for four people to do it, then you will only be given two and a half. Tools are too hard to come by because they are ""too expensive"", for a company that does over a hundred billion in sales and profits are in the millions. The biggest pro is the pay, and that is once you hit the Store manager level which is almost on par with low level Doctors. ",3,Former Employee,Store Manager ,"Troy, AL",8/23/20,2020,8,23

They’ll be great...until they’re done with you. ,Working for Walmart is ok. Better than you’ve heard even. But don’t trust them for a second.

Flexible Work Hours but Otherwise Terrible,"I worked for Walmart for 4 years while I put myself through college. I started at minimum wage and worked part time, which averaged between 32-34 hours per week. Occasionally, I would be put on the schedule for 40 hours but never more than one week in a row for fear of having to give benefits to part time employees. Though I was technically a Photo Lab Associate, I rarely got to work in my department. I was constantly cashieribg, pushing carts, stocking other departments, or unloading trucks. Because of this, I was unable to complete my work in my own department and was constantly being reprimanded for it. All in all, it's not worth it. Unless you are looking to be a store manager, you will never be compensated fairly for the amount of work you are expected to complete on a daily basis.

The work is satisfactory and good people to work with.,"For the most part it isn’t a horrible place to work. The employees work very hard to get their jobs done and go above and beyond. The problem comes from management who have unreal and sometimes unattainable expectations. Very seldom are you shown praise for a job well done, but are always noticed if something isn’t done to expectations. Compensation is also lacking for middle of the road employees, at one point they gave upper associates a bump in pay and then keep raising the minimum wage for new associates and the folks in the middle have stayed the same so now new associates in a lot of cases are getting paid a higher hourly rate than those who have been there for 5 and over years.

I’m currently looking at jobs and am willing to take a $2.50 pay cut just to get out of there.

Reasonable work and pay with increasing lack of management.,"Over the past five years I have grown to feel that the management there has only gotten worse. When I started working there, they were very flexible with my schedule as I was still in school at the time. However, over time positions and departments changed. These changes caused several issues with scheduling and lack of coverage on certain days. Also, after several years of being there, I felt that the amount of work and assistance that I was providing was more than what I was being compensated for. Fast forward to the present and I currently have been placed in a position that I was when I barely started working there. I felt that to be unfair and a complete disregard to the work I have accumulated during five years. I also feel in the dark about many management changes and many associates, including myself, do not feel comfortable as things can happen at an instant. Overall the job is not the worst, but management and lack of coverage at times creates a tense and stressful environment. ",3,Current Employee,Sam's Club Associate ,"San Diego, CA",8/18/20,2020,8,18

Here is my whole experience at Walmart and will sound almost similar to other peoples bad experiences.I worked for Wal-mart for 4 years and learned a lot from there. They have great resources and high some technical advantages compared to other retail businesses. Problem is... if you got hired at the worst Walmart in town without even realizing it then you will see every ugly crack of the company. I became cap 2 stocking associate in my first year with a new team. Management quickly picked me as their favorite guy because I worked faster. Everyone around me who was there longer than me was treated poorly and written up fast if the new stuff from the truck wasn't off the conveyor belt at a certain time. I've seen an entire team get written up. All at once. They never write me up because I was their favorite for some reason because I knew how to stock the pets aisle faster and better than most people.Later in my first year they quickly promote me to Department Manager. I couldn't pass it up because it was more money. The department was a train wreck. I quickly found out I was nothing more than a person filling a spot because management was in panic mode and they chose their fast stocker for the postion which was me.

Then it went all down hill.  I worked at 58th and Georgia neighborhood walmart. Not only was my pharmacy manager very disappointing to work for but so were the store manager.  They were rude and very uncaring to help you out in anything. They would always pass the work to another manager and they always acted like they didn't know how to help you.  My pharmacy manager was the worse. He constantly micromanage you even in front of customers. He tells you to do one thing then gets mad when you don't read his mind to do what he wants you to do at that moment even though a few seconds before he told you to do that exact thing.  He tells you he will do this or that then doesn't fall though with his word.  He says we were a team but then individualized you out. He is constantly contridic what he tells you to tell patient then does the opposite. He takes extra steps and to help out his friends and overrides a cheaper price on items for his friends and family which I don't think is fair to other people. In front of managers he acts and says that he told you to do something or he related something to you but really didn't but constantly tries to make himself look better for them.

I would work 10 hour days with no breaks and still get told that I need to work harder because profits aren't where they should be,1,Former Employee,Bakery/Deli Associate ,"Durango, CO",8/16/20,2020,8,16
The other employees were fun to work with,"After clocking in I would find a my supervisor and see where they would want me to start, but If I was unable to find them I would start with the returns. I would usually work with 1-3 other zoners while we moved from section to section of the store.

The store I work at has a serious lack of good management ,"When I first started working there I loved my job but as time goes on the manager’s get worse and worse, it’s to the point if you aren’t one of their favorites you will never move up, they have been telling me I can move for 8 months just to always tell me no.",3,Current Employee,Stockman ,"Greenville, OH",8/16/20,2020,8,16
Hard work but plenty of reward. ,Working in a grocery DC you're working for the fastest growing segment of the world's largest private employer.  It's recession- proof.  When other companies are laying off we were hiring.  It's hard but rewarding work. ,4,Former Employee,Order Filler/Picker ,Oklahoma,8/16/20,2020,8,16
Horrible Management ,Was on the cash register and hadn't had a customer in over 20 mins. I asked to use the restroom which was less than 20 feet away and was refused by management to go. Thw manager on duty said that is to be done on breaks and lunches and that I left in less than 2 hours and could go then. The front end staff would take several breaks all longer than the allowed time limit.  I was accused twice of taking too long of a break which didn't happen because I set a timer. I asked to speak to a higher up about what was going on and she said she was too busy as she continued to just stand and chit chat with the front desks associated.

Met alot of great people,I worked at Walmart for a total of 7 years straight then quit then worked an additional two years. Let's start off by saying every Walmart is different. I have met people who loved there jobs and I met people who hated to go to work. I fall down the middle with my experience. I held a total of 3 positions. Management is a total issue and the customers are the worst in the buisness.

"Good to learn how to deal with people, but overall I didn’t like it. ","Overall, I think it’s not the worst, but it’s also not the best. Managers seemed to not know what was going on. Breaks were never on time. The HR  never considered circumstances as to why scheduling needed to be changed. Scheduling could NEVER be made easily. Apparently, it was supposed to be “flexible” for us, but in reality it’s flexible for them. Some customer interactions were good and some were just terrible. We were very understaffed, and had many customers. It was chaotic. The Walmart that I worked for didn’t care about the employees whatsoever. It’s all business and profit.

Too much work, too little pay, there is no companionship, bosses have employee preferences, they always give less work to lazy people who don't do anything to preferred ones, they give them a weekend off, really working at Walmart is an explanation if you're a good employee they exploit you  And they give you many days of work in a row when you ask for a day to be absent, it is very difficult for them to approve it of course, only the preferred ones are given that job is only for lazy people who do not like to do anything that is how they only value you",2,Current Employee,Associate ,"Port Richey, FL",8/15/20,2020,8,15

Nothing good happens here,"I would describe a typical shift here as waiting for the equipment to show up or trying to find equipment that actually works to being harped on by your overbearing and micromanaging boss that treats you all like a child. After you come back from your 1 hour lunch you have to search for your equipment that someone took from your cart or they actually took your cart. The totes that are used for pick up are dirty and some have mold. They have NEVER been cleaned. Don't trust most of the other associates. The job itself is wonderful if you like shopping, the management is the worst. This store has a new store manager every few months.

Favored certain employees and scrutinized those who spoke up. They never offered hands on training or knew basic things. Instead, only cutting ""this is how I was taught"" mentality. Efficiency, effective communication, people skills and employee rights were not important to the management. Instead, letting their political views stand in the way of establishing true teamwork and efficiency.● CultureToxic, overbearing, if you don't believe that everything that Walmart does ""is the best thing ever"", then you'll get in their bad side.

Productive Workplace ,"Applying as an Overnight GM Stocker taught me various knowledge such as stocking shelves, adjusting labels, remove damaged items from shelves and inventory, organize backroom space, trained new employees.Also was a backup cashier and providing customer service such as greeting customers and ask if they needed any assistance or questions about the store or product(s) they are searching. There was also learning 2 new department and they were cutting fabrics and printing off sales labels and helping customers in apparel.The most enjoyable part about overnights was the employees, good times and bad, but overall everybody is friendly, helpful, and loves to bring a smile on peoples faces. The most difficult part of being an Overnight GM Stocker had to be remembering every single items location, mod, department, and if there were more than one location, and backroom bins. Each department has an assigned shelf and if they didn't then they are merged with another.

"Company concentrates on making money, not supporting their workers or their managers","Every day there were changes on our registers that were never explained or brought to our attention.  We had to discover them in the middle of customers.  There was no room for being sick, and even when there were health risks of being contagious, the managers expected the employee to come to work.  Management issues were not handled privately.  Reviews were done slipshod.  Training was substandard.  There were no procedure manuals worth using for questions or support.  The Customer Service Managers over the cashiers were either lackadaisical in their support or too overworked to come to the aid of a cashier on a timely basis.  Customers had to wait often 20 minutes for a manager to appear.  The equipment continued to break and malfunction.  The schedule changed sometimes weekly for part time employees.

"Decent job with alright co-workers, poor management and job culture ","I worked here for nearly 4 years. Management is an absolute joke. Walmart gives large bonuses to upper management ONLY if they receive a good “quarterly score”. This causes management to give absolutely no cares about you, or your team. They will make you do far more work than you’re supposed, while at the same time impeding your work by taking your workers off task and then blaming you for it. If you are a hard worker, expect to be taken advantage of. I’d you’re am awful worker, expect to have an easy job for life because they’d rather make the workers carry the weight rather than reprimanding those who refuse to work, or do low-quality work. Management literally does not take the time to address problems and always has a “if you don’t like it then you’re easily replaceable”. I’ve been told this and heard my workers being told this. Not only that, I’ve been specifically told that I am “paid to work, not paid to think”. The work environment is increasingly toxic, and it will drain your mental health. I quit because of the management, and the management is what is preventing me from ever seeking employment at Walmart again. ",2,Former Employee,Supervisor ,"San Francisco, CA",8/12/20,2020,8,12
Worst job experience ,I would not recommend them for any reason. The manager team is a joke . No real directions to follow except one day do it this way the next they’re asking why you’re doing it that way .

"Awful management, just horrible","I've never been treated so horribly in all my years of working similar jobs. I was often berated (even in front of customers) for not meeting goals that were clearly impractical, and I'm a hard worker! I've never dealt with such straight up disrespectful managers in my life (not all but the majority). I'm a hard worker and always stay on task. Even if you go over and beyond trying to get everything finished in time, if it's not completed, the managers will scold you for it. The problem was rarely you, it was simply that you were given a task you couldn't possibly finish in time by yourself or even with only two people. They didn't care and would deny that you were given too much work in the time allotted. I was so taken aback by how so many of them would talk to us. It's the kind of treatment that you would expect from prison guards, minus the physical violence. I thought I've dealt with my fair share of bad managers in the past, but this was on a whole new level. Imagine the worst possible, terribly rude customer. Now imagine that customer is now your boss. Not every manager there was horrible, but far too many of them were.From the very beginning, I learned how horrible and disorganized the management was. When I went in for my interview, no one even knew I had one. No one was there to interview me. I talked to two other people who said this happened to them as well. There was no real training. My first day, I was sent to an area by myself with no one to guide me. It's pretty easy stuff though, so all of this wasn't a big deal to me, THEN.

A Hard Company to Work For Overall,It’s just retail.  Maybe not as bad as some of the other chains but there are some unrealistic expectations.

Terrible,"I started out here because I wanted to get back into fulfillment. It was a great start, I eventually started working outbound Problem Resolution (“PR”) and when an official PR position was opened, I applied. Well, I got used by management to do PR, which requires more advanced skills than just basic warehouse functions, and never got called to interview for the job despite being told I was a candidate for an interview. I waited 10 weeks and was used for that time to perform in this function. I moved to the inbound department, but still at the base associate level. That was awful, too. Totally disorganized and they will break you in order to make their numbers. The temps take a lot of managements time, and the people that can help are rude because they are stressed out about being spread too thin. I will not miss this place at all. Also, if you are hired at a Jet.com (now Walmart) facility, you cannot take advantage of the “Dollar A Day” education program because “Jet” hires do not interface properly in the third party education administrators database. So don’t believe them when they tell you they will help you pay for tuition to pursue a degree. ",2,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate  ,"Reno, NV",8/12/20,2020,8,12

"Great people to work with, not so much with management","In my years at Walmart I have seen a lot of managers come and go. Sometimes you get a reason that makes sense and others you get fed lies. The behind the scenes politics is definitely something people have to look out for. Positions come up and are open to apply for but unless you have somebody pull for you, odds are you will be passed up for someone either less fitting or with the same exact credentials you have. The hourly assosciates are some of the best in my opinion, constantly helping each other and working as a team.

Apply elsewhere,"● Work-life balanceNot good. If you can, get another job.● ManagementAs I was leaving to a better job, the store manager got changed from a good manager to a horrible one. It was a woman who came wanting to show off and prove that she could do the job better than the manager before, but all that she got was the anger and hate of the employees by being nasty, yelling at everybody and being so rude, like if she had come from the streets. We saw her humiliating employees in front of the clients just to show that she had the power. She had no education or manners of a manager  whatsoever. I believe she’s still there.Thank God I was leaving!● OverallBad place to work. The store manager and some assistant supervisors are so nasty that I don’t even think is worth how low they pay you for that. There was a lot of humiliation and yelling from the management to the employees in front of the customers.

Wal-Mart is meh....super meh..,"everything depends on which store you work at but there are some things i've notice at all stores ive been to. First off if you mess up youll hear the rumor about it before anyone ever approches you. There are so many rules before you can get in trouble, so if they pull you to the back to talk to you, you can probably open door the write up and have it removed for whatever arbitrary reason. It is so hard to get fired from Walmart, so your least favorite co worker will probably be with you for a very long time. Up side is, nobody gives half a care about their job, so all you have to do is put in a very small amount of effort and you can go far at Wal-Mart. down side is if they notice you putting in any effort at all theyre going to milk you dry, the more you advance the more complete control they have over your life. Market team sets unreasonable expectations, and expect you to reach goals regardless of staaffing or access to equipment need to complete goals. Example: you could have 5 call ins, youre goal for the day does not change and no you cant have any help, so you stay late, now youre in trouble for having o.t, so you leave early one day, your tasks for that dont get done, now youre in trouble for not completing those task even though they sent you home early. You cant get mad at them though, theyre only riding you because the market team (who have no idea whats going on in the store) are riding them, poor treatment of associates trickles down like that.Associates who have worked for the company for 15 years make 30c more than people that just walked in the door. i - more...",2,Current Employee,Manager ,"Normal, IL",8/11/20,2020,8,11

The HR lady was very nice but she reeked of carrots. I worked cap 1 sooooo, you get to work from 4am to 1pm. You will spend the first hour in a freezer pretty much. Your team will be very essential to getting your work done on time. However expect no respect from other teams, cap 2, bakery, Apparel, etc. They will leave messes for you, or create them and then yell at you for moving all their trash over so you can complete your work. One day I was dropping which means I am the one who takes the pallet jack and picks up the loads and delivers them to the floor/isles. Bakery stacked all their boxes against one of my pallets and it all spilt over and I got yelled at! PS: ALL THE BAKERY ASSOCIATES ARE BRAIN SURGENS!

Great department to work.,"The other people in my department were o.k.  Shift starts with cooking all snacks like cheese sticks, hot dogs, and egg rolls.  I did learn health and food safety. Proper food storage. Management was a joke.  Hardest part of the job:  washing dishes (3 hours).  Never left on time.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Amarillo, TX",8/9/20,2020,8,9

You'll be Overworked and Micromanaged,"As an Order Filler, you'll be set to a standard of productivity which is near impossible to do without breaking your break every single day. The management also acts like they are you friend but will stab you in the back and terminate you no matter if you've been there for a month or 20 years. The breaks are too short (Two 10 minute breaks for a 12 hour shift? Ridiculous!) and your 30 minute lunch is unpaid. Taking time off is near impossible if you don't have any Paid Time Off, which you only earn on hour of PTO per 30 hours worked. Just prepare to be having your life for 3 days a week if you decide to work her. Pay is good, but not good enough for the work you will do. One of the three longest tenured Order Fillers has only been here for a year, so that should tell you something right there. The only good aspect is the people you work with (non-management) are pretty good people. ",1,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Raymond, NH",8/9/20,2020,8,9
I was not prepared to do what they expected,"I had never worked for the company, so why they hired me to be a department head of 3 departments is beyond me. I did my best to uphold what I learned in the academy for supervisors. My management team would never let me implement what I was taught. When I fell short of perfection because of a lack of any real training, they demoted me to associate, sent me to help remodel a different store for 3 months and when I returned, I got fired for absences and tardies that had occurred during my first couple of months. Highly scetchy if ya ask me. I'll never work for them again if I can help it.",3,Former Employee,Dept. Manager ,"Carrollton, TX",8/9/20,2020,8,9

It’s a bad place,They’re rude very disrespectful of my religion and people of color and disabled people. They make fun of anyone who asks a question to succeed in their tasks and yells at you for taking a break writes you up for taking a break or lunch and constantly puts their workers in danger. They fired me for a customer complaint that isn’t even true. They said the customer said “i was rude and unhelpful” when I have proof i wasn’t on the floor at all that week.

Top-heavy management structure,"There is no typical work day and the hours varied from week to week. I learned customer service, stocking, department manager skills to include ordering to fill outs, resetting mods, working with other associates, etc. I also learned how to use a cash register. There were a few good managers that cared about the associates and their needs both at work and at home. The management overall was inconsistent and difficult to work with. The hardest part of the job was the drastic change in the amount of hours an associate received each week. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers to help find what they needed.",2,Former Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Lacey, WA",8/9/20,2020,8,9

Was once a great company to work for!!!,"I worked for Wal Mart Pharmacy for 20 years which by any standard is a very long career. In the beginning it was a positive ,respectful place to work . A place where you felt the sky was the limit and opportunities were there with hard work and adaptability. Although there is no perfect place to work I looked forward to going to work and facing the challenges of the day at least the first 15 years or so. Fast forward to the last 3 years of my career and I couldn't even recognize the place anymore. It became a struggle to manage through the micromanagement and lack of respect for the individual.  Dont know if it was a sign of the times but it's almost like two different companies. I worked for. Use it as a stepping stone to bigger and better things cause in the end you'll realize you are nothing but a warm body to this corporation.

Easy job but boring ,"This was a ok job, stress free pretty boring 0 brain cells need to be used for this job. You just look for items and scan, I think the most irritating thing is when you can’t find a item. You have to go up to the desk and get a alternate, it’s only irritating because you have to get off the lift. The ics system is very outdated, the training was cool easy. The other mangers “blue vest” people are irritating especially when they’re not your department manager! A lot of people ste@l from them, the way they check you going through the metal detector is outrageous but still you’ll find open packages in the racks.

Not allowed to do your job and laughably bad insurance,"The store manager does not allow you to do your job.  You have to do grocery shipment the entire day, which is meant to be CAP team's job, but department managers have to do it instead while CAP team is desperately trying to be trained and management just does not care.  Then when department managers' job doesn't get done, they get yelled at for that even though they were told by management that if they left grocery they would get in trouble.  They are damned if they get their job done and damned if they don't.  The insurance is down right pathetic.  I had a $960.00 bill from my doctor and the insurance plan offered me $20.00 to pay for it, and this is with the highest plan offered, for which I was paying over $500 per month.  The customers are mean and think they are entitled to everything.  There is nobody at walmart that you can work for who does not abuse you.  To corporate, their associates are nothing but a number.  They make billions of dollars every minute, yet they don't offer more than minimum wage for entry level, and higher positions are not paid much more.  The upper management team only hires based on who they are friends with.  Everybody working at the New Ulm walmart is actively searching for a new job, and it's not hard to see why.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"New Ulm, MN",8/8/20,2020,8,8

Work isn't bad but Managers are really lazy.,Overall most employees are great working with but there are a decent amount of bad ones. The worst thing is that they get away with it because management is lazy. They only work when the store manager is there. Rather than that most of the managers just sit in the office.,3,Current Employee,Automotive Service Technician ,"Emporia, KS",8/8/20,2020,8,8
The customers were great!,"Working for this company has its ups and downs. If you are a people person you will have plenty of opportunities to interact with others. As a cashier, I always endeavored to be quick and accurate along with being personable. The most difficult part of the job in my opinion would be the days that are slow. Keeping busy always makes work more pleasant. I believe management could use a little help in the category of caring for the staff but I suppose it's like most jobs.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Colby, KS",8/8/20,2020,8,8
It's a job,"They basically shuffle people thru and expect them to be fired or quit before insurance kicks in. There were 80 or so people in 2 orientation classes and I quit after 8 months. There was one guy left from the classes, the rest were fired or quit. It's not a difficult job, but the disciplinary system is ridiculous. I drove a forklift, and they have a certain amount of moves to be made in a day or you get points (written up). Some days there weren't enough moves possible because it was slow. Didn't matter, you will be written up. I was told to log out and wait then log in and try to make it up that way. Cheat the system to survive. So pretty much there were days when I came in I knew with certainty that I will be penalized at the end of the day because there wasn't enough work. No big deal, you pretty much see the writing on the wall after a few weeks then you start looking for a new job. The money isn't bad, but this isn't a keeper unless you have no other options. Schedule isn't bad, OT is available, and not a horrible work environment. But....know what it is - a good enough for now job. ",2,Former Employee,Lift driver ,"Pottsville, PA",8/8/20,2020,8,8

All of the terrible things I've heard about Walmart are true!,"Terrible culture, bad overall management from top to bottom. The communication is terrible, there's low moral, at times it is a hostile work environment with no competitive pay.

Lure of a good place for a paycheck ends in scramble to find other employment,"You're probably thinking, ""I need a job to pay bills, get that car/house I want, etc. etc."" And you'd be right in thinking Walmart is a decent place to get enough cash to pay for certain things. But after about a month or so, you'll be sick of it. The people kissing up to the managers to get higher positions, getting dragged to other departments (mostly the online ordering department), the rude/impatient customers, the questionable promotions for sketchy employees. My verdict? If you really need a job and the money, work at Walmart. But do not, and I mean: DO NOT stop looking for better employment. Use this place as a stepping stone, because that's all it should be.",1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Post Falls, ID",8/8/20,2020,8,8
The people you work with are okay,The people around you are nice but at the same time not. It's mainly managment that is against you and make you feel unwanted.

Bad First Job,"Paid well, but the managers were rude. Atleast in the department I worked, many of them only care about helping themselves. There was a few times when I almost went into meal violation (as a minor, also can cause a write up). They would not pay attention to sending people to breaks/lunches. Played favorites, let some people do whatever they wanted to do, but made others go to lunch late. Terrible first job, would not go back. I worked there for four months, loved it at first until it felt as if I was being walked over and taken advantage. Icouldn’t take it anymore, some of the other employees were the sweetest people, but some would cause more drama. Managers allowed it to happen, and some of them would even start drama. I don’t recommend working there.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Shepherdsville, KY",8/8/20,2020,8,8

"Bad Management, Terrible Customers","Listen, it’s Walmart. You can expect it to be trash. But get ready to be treated like you’re completely worthless by managers and customers alike. Managers were so unsupportive, it was ridiculous. The amount of work I did for this job was worth a LOT more than $11/hour. I wouldn’t recommend working here to anyone, especially if you’ve never had a job before. This is NOT the place to begin. Side note: I worked here with the hopes of moving up in this company. With the new policies in place, it’s impossible to move anywhere above a cashier.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Denton, TX",8/8/20,2020,8,8
Do not work here unless you want to slave,"Walmart is a million dollar business so why am I sweating at work for over 8 hours? The base pay is 13.85 , get paid every two weeks. the heat is draining. it’s just ridiculous. i’ve been here for a month now and currently looking for somewhere else. understand that i’m a receiving clerk but yet i still have to stock (not my job). you can’t view your hours or pay AT HOME until your manager or hr reset MULTIPLE passwords. I wouldn’t recommend this job to a homeless person, unless they like the heat. there is absolutely no air circulation in majority of the departments, especially where i work. they’re not even taking the necessary steps to protect again co-vid besides wearing a hot mask allllll day but IN THE HEAT! no free water bottles (they just started the end of july and it’s only 2 days out the week) i’m highly disappointed in this company. i thought i would like it bc the amount of work you’re doing should equal a nice check buttttt it is what is it. hopefully I find something more rewarding for me. but good luck to you if you’re reading this lol oh and no drug test upon hiring.. only background. drug test if injured. you have to bring your belongings to a first come first locker bc you can’t go out to your car during work hours",1,Current Employee,Stocking & Receiving Clerk ,"Atlanta, GA",8/8/20,2020,8,8
Walmart was an okay experience,I worked in the warehouse/distribution center. It was an okay job. It's a production job. I only worked 3 12 hours shifts and had Tues-Friday off so the best thing about the place is work life balance and it paid good money. They work is really physical and no AC. Plus management was awful. It's hard to get fired from there but it was like they always looked for reasons to write you up. Honestly your experience depended on what department you were in/who your department manager was. During certain times of the year like Christmas or pandemic you will work crazy overtime and are expected to show up for 5-6 days a week which could put you close to 70 hours per week. It is what you make it. The turnover rate is high. I wouldn't tell anyone to not work there though.,3,Former Employee,Non-Con Order Filler ,"LaGrange, GA",8/8/20,2020,8,8

The only care about making money,I worked there for 1 year and 9 months and it’s the worst place to go if you want to be successful. It’s a good paying job than most but it has bad management. I worked at 3 different stores and management needs to be improved.,2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Melbourne, FL",8/8/20,2020,8,8
Great for beginners ,Walmart is hit or miss with both employees and managers. While I was working there anyone friends with the store manger could not get fired. Other managers would come to the store drunk as a fish yet still had his job for years. Employees talk a lot so be very mindful of what and who you talk about. It can be a very stressful environment especially around fall time Christmas time. It’s very easy to advance up in the store. ,3,Former Employee,Cap Team Supervisor ,"Paso Robles, CA",8/8/20,2020,8,8

Bad management!! ,"This specific facility had terrible managing, if you had a problem and need it fixed such as your direct deposit change, need to change availability, or put in for a transfer you had to do it all on management time and waited 2-4 days to resolve your problem with proper management. My position of Cap 2 stoker and unloading was seen as the most unneeded part of the business and was held to high expectations, we were also not given the proper equipment to fulfill the tasks put at hand. The job was very hot, and physically demanding. ",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Chillicothe, MO",8/8/20,2020,8,8

It is a fun and satisfying work experience for me as my first job.,"I loved working at Walmart because I got to see my friends and at the end of the day working 8 hours twice a week on Saturdays and Sundays I enjoyed getting almost $700 a month.  It was basically enough for me to buy most things I wanted.  A cashier is an easy job and it wasn't too hard to work as one.  I had to call the manager by phone to get an interview and the manager responded quickly.  I quit working there because of school and this is one of the reasons why I didn't like school as it was the solely based reason I couldn't work on the weekdays.I am currently trying to get back to Walmart so I can continue earning money, I didn't care about how much I earned since I didn't earn that much money back then.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Gilbert, AZ",8/7/20,2020,8,7

"Easy work, good money, hit or miss management. Overall decent.","Let me say that walmart is the perfect place to start working as your first job, if you're anything but a cart associate. They replaced the best manager i've ever had. He understood everyone's feelings so well and always made sure that when he gave us stuff to do, he told is in a way that wouldn't make us feel like we're being bossed around. He worked with out schedules so well. They replaced him with someone who ended up complaining about our availibility. Many times cart pushers would be by themselves for hours or sometime all day. This wasn't so bad until I realized that, after 6 months of asking, my manager had no interest of moving me inside to work. Worked for a year and would constantly ask to move inside. We went through 4 hiring cycles before I realized that my manager had no interest in moving me inside. The last straw was when she needed to move a cart pusher to help the stockers for a couple of weeks and picked someone else when she knew I wanted out of cart pushing. Management is a huge hit or miss just like any other retail store. The friends you make along the way are the best part of the journey though. It was also like this when I tried transferring to another walmart. It feels like walmart hates its cart pushers and doesn't want them anywhere but cart pushing",3,Former Employee,Cart Associate ,"McAllen, TX",8/5/20,2020,8,5
Active but stressful workplace,"Walmart's Cap Team 2 associates are put hard at work every day to help maintain the constant movement of Walmart and its customers. Most every day clocking in there was instantly something to be done. I learned a lot about proper time management at Walmart to get my job done on time while saving as much time as possible. Management was a problem however, During my time there my squad rarely had an actual manager or assistant manager to assist us. Our ""managers"" were really the few people on the team that had worked there the longest and understood what to do. The hardest part about being a Cap Team 2 associate was the constant stress I was under every shift. Having a 7 hour shift and being told there is 10 hours of work for me to do alone was very stressful and even when going on break I was stressed because We'd be told to go back to work before our break is even over. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with. All of us were about the same age range so it was easy to get along and accomplish a common goal without feeling like you were being talked down to.

A productive work place and a good opportunity to practice people skills,"A typical day at Walmart consists of stocking shelves and maintaining good relations between employees and customers. Being able to remember where items and products are located throughout the store is definitely a plus and especially understanding how products work in comparison to others.

Bad in-communicative management,"Since the first day, there where people who didn't welcome me to the job. This was my first job so I didn't know what to expect. I applied to this job for the picking position and instead they put me as a permanent dispenser. This breaks their work rules since management was always talking about how everybody is supposed to do both, picking and dispensing. I asked management when I could be moved for the job I applied for, and in very subtle ways they let me know that it was never happening, they barely even wanted to train me for picking. So, I was stuck in a very physically demanding job instead of the one I wanted. Management also preached about how every employee was the same and nobody was higher than anybody which was a lie. Employees that had been there for longer where able to skip dispensing duties and ordered newer employees around. Many of them would be normally found in the backroom through the day and it just was not fair. Apparently, my management thought me and another employee where talking too much and instead of telling us both, they decided to only tell them, leaving me oblivious to their concerns. They decided to fire me on the spot for this, something I received zero warning or word about from management. I was fired for something so simple while management would turn their heads (in front of other employees) at employees who where lazying around on their phones saying things like ""oh wow, look who's on their phone again *eye roll*"".

You follow in their foot steps and leave.,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service/Lay Away/online grocery/photo lab ,"Woodstock, VA & stephen city va",8/5/20,2020,8,5
Work 7 days a week,No work life balance and there is seeming to be no resolve to fix this matter and is the root of the high turnover rate for area managers. The culture is poor.,1,Current Employee,"Area Manager, Operations ","Atlanta, GA",8/5/20,2020,8,5
Poor management above store level,"Most of the store management is great. The problems comes from the stores are not allowed to order the equipment needed for associates to perform their duties easily. Management isn’t always allowed to hire new associates for positions that need to be filled, when they should be filled. Compensation for work done isn’t what it should be at either. You are asked to pull over time to get things done that upper management wants done, but you aren’t allowed to keep your overtime, so you have to figure out a way to cut it before the end of the week. There are also associates that don’t pull their fair share of the work load and management makes others pick up the slack, instead of disciplining the slackers and getting rid of them. This is due to perpetually being understaffed and management feels that having a body there is more important than having working bodies there. All these things combine to make the hard workers get fed up and quit or just not care anymore, and do to this it is giving Wal-Mart a bad name, so no one wants to apply for a job anymore. As an example I have heard management say several times that they have had 30+ positions to fill, but only a dozen applications and they all were either not responding or said they weren’t interested. Wal-Mart isn’t the family environment it used to be. It is all about getting more money in shareholders pockets now. Figuring out how do do more with less people or no equipment is the new motto set down by upper management. ",2,Former Employee,Deparment Manager ,"Winchester, VA",8/5/20,2020,8,5
Productive and safe work environment ,Walmart is a great place to work with a ton of great benefits. I wish Walmart would pay their workers more and offer more hours or overtime that you could we could work. ,4,Current Employee,Customer Service ,"Ladson, SC",8/5/20,2020,8,5
Management sucks,I don’t recommend working here unless your a brown noser. I thought other places was bad but this place wins 1st place in horrible management. They beat you down mentally and only allow there favorites to advance. Cashier is a dead end job there. You only get part time but may work full time hours. If your sick and call in you never hear the end of it. If you get on there bad side they will find reasons to make you finally say that’s it I quit or fire you,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Kokomo, IN",8/5/20,2020,8,5

Has gone to dirt,WalMart was a happy and fun place to work. Sam Walton use to come sit and talk to associates and use our ideas. We don't have a voice anymore. Nobody wants to go to work because it is just another job. At onetime we couldn't wait till time to go to work. Nowdays people get there feelings hurt when you say anything they don't like.

"No staff, no equipment? Suck it up and get it done anyway!","We have been severely understaffed since I began in February. Despite receiving promise after promise to get fully staffed, I have had two people join my team--and I still need six more. Despite the obnoxiously low manpower, we are still expected to get everything done--our jobs AND the jobs of CAP team. I'm somehow supposed to pull help from other areas of my team in order to fulfill the job that CAP team is supposed to do, regardless of the fact that I have two people in each area every morning--if I'm lucky and no one calls out. Handheld scanners are scarce as hen's teeth; one of my departments has a scanner and no printer; the other has a printer and no scanner. That scanner has been missing for three months. The store manager promised to find it, but has yet to do so. He is more concerned with being on vacation, and has no backbone to enforce process.Management in my current store is horrendous; they willfully create drama and fighting, laugh at harassment/assault of female employees, and no one is ever held accountable for anything.

My co workers are great people and have made some good friends here. But, the job itself is a joke. Management doesn't care about your health or personal issues at all. The open door policy here is a complete joke as anytime you have a problem and need to address something with management and try to make some changes, they laugh at you and try to sweep it under the rug like nothing is wrong which they have done since I started working here.

The bad and the alright. ,The alright is you get paid at a decent amount. The bad is no one really cares about their jobs at Walmart. No one is really properly trained. You have to learn most of your materials from other coworkers who have also just learned through the grape vine of people. The managers are horrible and do absolutely nothing about anyone mistreating you. Absolutely do not ask the managers to help you with anything because you’ll be yelled at and sent home.

Perfect example of how Monopolies ruin this country,"Started working there as a temp/seasonal associate, and was promoted three times in two years (Money Center/ Entertainment Manager/Support Manager). Lots of opportunities for growth and advancement, but the company culture is disgusting.They abuse associates, and take advantage of the fact that most employees are in poverty and cannot easily find another line of work.Management is taught from the top-down to use employees like they are animals. At first I had the idea to keep advancing up the company until I could change the culture in the region I worked in, but began to realize the culture is deeply engrossed in the company by executives who care nothing about their employees and only about the already insanely lucrative profit margin. Executives get paid a gross amount compared to the associates.This is coming from someone with a Bachelor's in Finance and a Master's in business management.

"Hard work, hard workers","If you show up, do your best, and try your hardest, you will be fine here. Most of the people who don't make it here struggle with one of the above three things. I believe the management does the best they can. I do not know first hand what it is like to be management here, but it seems to me the management is pushed very hard (from the store manager to the assistant managers). The hardest part of the job is not being allowed to say anything to the customers who take their mask down while inside the store. As associates we share air with the thousands of customers who come into the store everyday. I care about my team members and it is very rude for customers to take their masks down.I have worked under much worse management than what we have here and only once under management this good. The management does their best and tries their hardest and as long as you do, they won't give you a hard time. If you don't show up, do your best, and try your hardest, your stay will probably be uncomfortable (as it should).Most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the regular customers, seeing my team members, and watching the managers working hard. It's nice being with what I understand to be the best store in the region. If you are working with the best, look at the management. When you tell the management they do a good job, they say the success is because of the associates.

"If you dont mind low pay and a point system, Walmart is ok.",I don't have many positive things to say about Walmart. They don't seem to care about their employees or emergency situations.

They do not follow through on their own company procedures/ideas.,The management are so overwhelmed by all that is on their plate that they don’t have time to be available to those reporting to them.

Decent job to start a resume ,Good first job or someone to make some extra money management sucks tho they need better managers pay was decent for extra money an easy work could move up but still not a career without living at the store,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Hanover, PA",8/3/20,2020,8,3
Got stuck with the worst job in the store ,"There was 5 cart pushers when I started and when I decided to leave there was about three of us left, I'm sure my experience would have been better if I had gotten a job inside but I got stuck with cart pushing. It was really tough to keep up with all the customers we got and if we couldn't our supervisors and customers would get annoyed but we did what we could. Anyway, I never got an opportunity to work inside so I can't really review that but I'm sure anything's easier with air-conditioning and when you don't need to worry about rain or heat.",3,Current Employee,Stocker/Cart Pusher ,"Wood Village, OR",8/3/20,2020,8,3

its an inspiring place that strives to bring out the best in all its employees,"one of my best experiences in retail i could of have ever experienced. My supervisors were understanding and willing, and they were able to show genuine empathy for whatever problem i might've had going on in my personal life that might've caused my performance at work to hinder, if it weren't for them. And for that i am appreciative of the opportunity of being able to say i worked alongside them",5,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Jacksonville, FL",8/3/20,2020,8,3

Very draining job,"A typical day at work consisted of pushing a cart around all day and getting groceries. I learned more about merchandising and how grocery stores are run. As far as management a majority of them were extremely unprofessional, but some did try to help associates and make sure they were satisfied in their work. The workplace culture was very racist at times in my location. The hardest part of the job was having to consistently pick up heavy totes and items such as dog food, the consistency of it will eventually cause back pains. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was doing express picks because it gives you a lot of down time in order to wait on the customer.",2,Current Employee,E-commerce Clerk ,"Kennesaw, GA",8/3/20,2020,8,3

Only for the desperate,Management is never up to date on what goes on with this company and even if they are they lie to you. Play favorites all the time and won't make anybody full time so they can get their benefits. Should pay more for what expectations they have. Morale it's just not there.,2,Current Employee,Stocker/Receiver ,"Conway, AR",8/3/20,2020,8,3

I stayed busy all the time. Never had timevto be bored,I enjoyed working at Walmart.  I only quit because I was moving as States.  I had too many points from missing to transfer to a local Walmart.  I acquired too many points as I was trying to find a new place to live in Tennessee and the new landlord required us to go to a notary and so I couldn't leave TN until Tuesday instead of Sunday.

Not the best place to work,It more than likely depends on the location - so beware. Where I worked the people were lazy and management literally did nothing to stop it. The market manager also didn’t care to do anything to fix the issues in the pharmacy. Employees could be on their phones while patients were waiting in front of them and management didn’t care to say anything. Techs would take breaks for 30+ minutes when we are allowed 15 minute breaks - nothing was done about that. Techs that worked there “for 25 years” didn’t know how to calculate a day supply for insulin. Not a good experience. I have 4+ years of retail pharmacy experience and I will never go back.,2,Former Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,Maine,8/3/20,2020,8,3

Management was rude to employees by ignoring needs for assistance.  ,"I love working with people.  Enjoy talking with  all races.   I am dependable, responsible,  friendly.

Company does not care for their employees,"The pay is better than most places here in my area but that’s about the only plus. Management is horrendous & disorganized. There was a mistake in HR where my part-time/full-time status wasn’t changed in the company files, so when it came time to apply for insurance (which only happens once a year, with a 30 day period to sign up) I suddenly “didn’t qualify” because the HR records didn’t show me as a full-time employee for the allotted amount of months — although, I had been working full-time hours the entire time.Policy changes are always taking place that never benefit the customer, but the company. They oversaturate their pharmacy employees by not giving them enough support and/or assistance.The plus side to everything listed above is that I had some* great co-workers.

My job has become more a routine and not very challenging ,"Most days I have to deal with a large group of customers, averaging about one customer every 2 minutes, so in a typical day I will attend between 120 and 200 customers. Many days, I have very little or no help at all and by the end of my shift I am exhausted. I feel that there is little to no opportunity for me to advance to a salary management position and that is very frustrating. My education and my skills are not used in my job.

But if you haven’t they don’t train well,"I been with them for 4 months and I have open availability and I get around 33-37 hours a week. I was asked if I would like full time and said yes, and still nothing, empty promises. I work for a Neighborhood store it’s smaller which I like but at times you have to go help other departments and then you have to go back to yours and the times when it’s time for a break you don’t find anybody to cover your break because you’re working alone and if there’s two people scheduled they always pull one person so we can never get ahead",5,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",8/2/20,2020,8,2

Store Manager ,United States,8/2/20,2020,8,2
Management were bullies. The work itself was fine. ,"Nothing about working at Walmart is difficult. The work is easy to learn and do. The problem is management and the culture of sycophancy that they cultivate on purpose. Coworkers throw each other under the bus just to make themselves look good or avoid trouble from management. Management will harass you about your speed at performing your tasks. They’ll stare you down, speak to you rudely, play favoritism with others while treating you like you don’t work, spy on you from around corners or from a distance and think you don’t notice and hold grudges against you if you stand up for yourself. It’s a very toxic work environment only for the cutthroat or very determined to endure. The work itself is fine but it is labor intensive and you will hurt yourself if you listen to management and try to go at their speed. There are better jobs. In ten years I only got the equivalent of a 50 cent raise because new hires began to start at $11 while I was making $11.50 after ten years of breaking my back and being bullied by management. I was moved to different departments and shifts against my will. I was harassed by a particular manager and tried to use the open door policy but the store manager just doesn’t care. Very poor management and a very disorganized place to work. Very toxic work environment and laughable compensation. Not worth your time, especially the Miami OK store.

Great work environment,"It's a great place to work. They offer good benefits like a 10% discount, 401k and paid time off.

Stressful. Not worth the pay.,"Worked as a cashier for 6 months. Customers are rude and don’t know how to act and management at my location was horrible. CSM’s would run off to other places when we were backed up. Tried to move departments but management in general is terrible. They play favorites and barely do their own job. Coworkers were snobby too, just not worth the trouble unless you’re a suck up.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Muscle Shoals, AL",8/1/20,2020,8,1

Allot of sugar coating..,"When you start the job, they will tell you many things that make Walmart great. The benefits, the pay, and so on. But, when you start, it’s like you need to find out things on your own. They have a “Forgiving Point System”, but yet after over a month of working there you’ll find yourself (for no reason at all) having allot of points. Don’t get me wrong, the pay is great. But I see why this is an “in and out” job. The breaks are also terrible. If you work a 10 hour shift, you get a 15 min, and a 20, and a 12 hour shift gets two 20 min breaks. It doesn’t sound bad right? Well, the break rooms are very far from the work station and you’re expected to leave your area at the time your break starts and to be back no later than 5 minutes after your break has ended. Mind you, the breakroom is almost a 10 minute walk. I could go on and on, but I do not recommend this place unless they make reasonable changes.

It was a good job for me,"I worked there almost 7 years. I started as an overnight stocker, then went to overnight maintenance, then to claims. I enjoyed the people I worked with.

I requested for transfers but management were no help at all in the process.,5,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"LaGrange, GA",8/1/20,2020,8,1
One of the worst places I have ever worked,"Management showed extreme favoritism. I was a cashier and wanted to move to a different department once I stayed over 6 months, but somehow the newer hires got those positions waaayyy earlier than they should have according to their policy... It was nearly impossible to move to a different department unless you were brown-nosing management. Being verbally abused by customers was not fun either.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Calhoun, GA",8/1/20,2020,8,1

management should listen better some do/most don't,it is ironic that when i file my application for Walmart i applied for a position call warehouse receiving coordinator at 19.00 an hour but when i Interviewed it turn out to be in maintenance instead for 11.50 an hour in which at the time i was unemployed knee deep in debt so i was willing to take anything but after 8 months i now had to take a 2nd full time job so i work over 80+ hours a week and at 61 years of age it is ruff. just saying most company's pay there maintenance employees much better wages that Walmart and i know the work criteria is more in the line of janitorial work but working understaffed as we do most of the time it is 1 employee to do all that needs to be done. just saying the wages need to be upgraded to a degree that would make Walmart a more appealing place to work. A Multi-billion corporation must stand above the rest in more ways than other company's to say they are the best to work for. definitely need to have better hands on security customers are stealing thousands of dollars from the store daily. ,4,Current Employee,Maintenance ,"Martinsville, IN",8/1/20,2020,8,1

Not flexible and too much drama.,"First couple of days were decent, the people in my department were honest about the job and let me say it wasn't good things that they have said. The hiring manager didn't give us a warning that we had to do our tax forms online after a month or two later when we all realized checks weren't being taken out for federal. Manager threw a piece of paper at me because he was angry that I asked him one single question ""he was busy"" sitting on his chair. During the phone interview they tell you that your job position is at one department only and when you start working there you get moved to other departments whether your done with your work or not and leave the other managers upset with you the next day. Discount on items don't come in until your a ""permanent"" employee which is ridiculous because I had to do deal with a lot of issues in those three months. Holidays will not be taken off your schedule because your forced to stay at work while managers get to go home to their families. I had to change my schedule for school and one of the managers let me know that my schedule will not be accepted because the days I picked weren't ""good enough"". Seriously this business needs a lot of work with their employees, everybody is fake with each other, nobody is happy reason why they are rude to customers, and managers need to find a different job if their current one isn't what they want.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Bellevue, NE",8/1/20,2020,8,1

Management is terrible,"As a department manager you have a massive workload. You are expected to do work for any other department when they are absent. Very little help when your department falls behind.  no one cares about you, and management plays favorites BIG time. The pay is pretty good, but needs an increase for higher level department managers. The assistant manager at my store is demanding and is rude. I hope that if you work for Walmart you work with managers who care about you growing as a person and actually train you to properly do your jobb before expecting absolute perfection. You also don’t get to manage your own department, upper management takes care of that for you by micromanaging everything you do. Your opinion doesn’t matter, even when it should.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Vancouver, WA",7/31/20,2020,7,31

Definitely a temporary/part-time job to have or else sanity and self-worth will deteriorate,"I definitely will admit that at my Walmart, some chill associates make everything so much better. The work is more fun and productive and it's nice to have people who are chill, but are willing to work. Some associates are just flat out mean and will make you hate your life and give you a hard time. It's up to you to be mentally strong and push on, not letting them ruin your day. Overall, Walmart is EXTREMELY fast-paced and requires a lot of physical labor, be prepared here. Rude customers will continue being rude and you have to be nice to them still, so put your best fake face on. I would avoid drama if you are here. Don't be yourself while working here because RUMORS SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRES. Stay quiet, do your job, and leave. Don't get all personal with anyone and don't try and make friends with anyone there. Don't get comfortable here, period. Just stay quiet and do the work and go home.

They pay isn’t great either, honestly save yourself all the stress and apply somewhere else!!!",3,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Dallas, TX",7/30/20,2020,7,30

Little to no room for advancement,"If you plan on moving up in the company, expect to beg on your knees for the dollar raise.

Don't get sick,"I love most of my coworkers and bosses. They're good people that often times make the job much easier. That said, there's so little freedom. The attendence point system is ridiculous, it's like you're being punished for getting sick. My store is constantly understaffed, which keeps stress levels pretty high. PTO takes forever to occur, and if you need to take extended time you have to go through this weird long process that no one will tell you how to do. If even one person calls out, the lines can get so incredibly long that it feels imposible to deal with. There have been times when I've been one of only 2 cashiers. There have been times I have cried in front of customers while checking them out.

There are other coworkers who are the opposite and do get promoted or fail in a department they just get shuffled around to another. Bending of rules for many but others they go by the book!

Regrettable as time passed,"A typical work day depends on how long you've been working. At first, it was fun learning the process and getting better at the department you're assigned to. You may feel the urge to shine - to become a great worker the more you practice at the job. Fast forward some months, and the hours are long - you will then realize that no matter how hard you work, how stressed you get, how much is placed on your shoulders, it will not be finished with finesse. The workload increases faster than the amount of workers the upper management is willing to hire to compensate. So the burden will fall on the lower management, which will trickle down to the hard workers to pick up the slack of those who show no desire to work. As for the atmosphere, you may notice some of the workers you are with may have been there for years at that same position for one reason or another.  Most, if not all, are elders - most of them kind and try their best. But despite your team's best efforts, the problems of the previous shift come forth onto you on a lot of the days, and it may seem nearly impossible to have a satisfactory work day every day. As someone who is detail-oriented and hates to disappoint others, I fell into the group that works hard and is relied upon hard - almost taken advantage without any pay increase for trying to complete the job you applied to. You may want to slack off because the others seem to, but your work ethic doesn't allow for that. You end up tiring out your body after the work day and can't enjoy the rest of what little day you have - and you'll have to repeat this for the next - more...",3,Former Employee,Overnight Dry Stocker Associate ,"Dallas, TX",7/27/20,2020,7,27

Only work here if you’re desperate,"I was desperate for a job so I applied here. It wasn’t too bad at first, but after a while it went downhill. Management is cliquey, refuses to work with your schedule, won’t give you requested days off. Constantly understaffed and left alone with little to no training. Manager refuses to do any work that doesn’t involve sitting around texting. Toxic culture, coworkers are snobby and judgmental.

Fun place to work in the beginning but rules change constantly and management was pretty lazy and also not the nicest,I worked here from 2015 to 2017 on Cap team and lawn and garden as well. Id say my favorite was working in lawn and garden. I was on Cap team for the longest and got called to the backroom and all over the store to do things that other employees could've done themselves. For example...I was called to the backroom by my manager to wrap a pallet when there were other employees working around her that were fully capable of helping themselves as so was she herself. Got called to help all over the store in the middle of being busy myself. Eventually they let me go over something senseless ,4,Former Employee,Cap 1 ,"Alma, MI",7/26/20,2020,7,26
Good pay ,Great learning experience. It taught me ways to work u dee pressure and handled excessive work loads. Customer service improved as well.

Assistant Manager,In a nutshell you are a slave to them. Prior to this I was an hourly manager and associate for 5 years and it was the best time. You actually could balance a life. The minute you become a salary manager your life is over. I had family issues to tend to and wanted to step down and was told no. I didn’t want to but I had no choice but to leave the company because there was so little compassion from my co-workers and my mangers above me. They would rather see a 5+ year associate walk out the door then try and help them. I’d never recommend becoming a salary manager for them unless some serious change happens and it starts with the poor constant rotation up top.,2,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Apopka, FL",7/26/20,2020,7,26

"The pay is a joke, and the work is hard","You'll be pressured to work well passed your shift, go above and beyond for the store, and sacrifice your physical well being and work-life balance for an average of $10.00 an hour. I've never gone more than a year at any given store before the workplace culture turns toxic. Management will demand more from you as you go along, and the only way to move up in the company is to know someone in a salary position. Homophobia and trans-phobia run rampant and no one ever takes complaints seriously.

Sadly, he left and was replaced with someone who seemed to see employees as nothing more than numbers. This company did little to help during COVID.

Even though there was an ordinance for customers to wear a mask Walmart wasn't following the ordinance and we as employees weren't allowed to say anything.

First Job I had,"For a first job I couldn’t have asked for better! I miss my old coworkers frequently and I miss eating lunch with friends and feeling like I belonged. When I worked there I was friendly with coworkers, managers, HR, customers, etc. The work kept my busy and made my days go by fast and honestly I think (though it’s been a few years) that I could remember how to still do things there. I would say the worst part about it was when they left you alone and you weren’t fully trained or confident in doing things by yourself. I had a few rowdy customers who want to see you squirm too, but that’s in all customer service. I had several different job titles at walmart. One of them was Pharmacy Sales/Support whatever you want to call it. The Pharmacist I worked under (after the main one left) grabbed my arm when I was distressed after the passing of a coworker IN the store (happened just at that time) and tried to physically pull me behind the counter to help there because she messed up the schedule. And when that didn’t work she tried to get me into trouble with management. I’m surprised she still works there to be honest. Other than that one really sour memory everything else wasn’t so bad. I even was able to walk to work. ",4,Former Employee,Pharmacy Sales Associate/Electronic Associate/Cashier/Photo Lab ,"Pottstown, PA",7/24/20,2020,7,24

No pay,Walmart will miss Employee payments. They do it mostly to contract drivers. But they will hold back payments on loads then claim it's a problem with a person in parole that is out for the week. Then continue with the next week still owing the driver the week before. This is a major problem with several drivers that deliver to stores and DCs. They are weeks in the hole on several thousands with drivers. They skip on payments they owe hoping some distance from the weeks on each driver will have them forget about it. It is a major problem. Very upsetting to hear about it and not believe it until it happens to you. Its unbelievable for this major company to do such a thing.,1,Current Employee,Driver ,"Palestine, TX",7/23/20,2020,7,23

"Management is terrible, and they don't care about their associates.","Walmart doesn't care about their associates. The managers are all either friends or trying to get each other fired. You've got management getting WAY too close to front end associates, and you've got management promoting people that have NO business being promoted. There's also the fact that they keep cutting hours and saying they'll ""fix"" it, which they never do. I've been shorted on the last THREE paychecks to where I can't aford to pay my bills, and that's AFTER a $1 pay raise. Trying to get ahold of literally ANYONE to help or talk about it is USELESS, because they're all mysteriously ""busy"", or they have that whole ""not my department, not my problem"" mentality.

Benefits available if you can afford them.,I had a deli supervisor position here and there is zero support from your managers.  I had a bunch of lazy kids working under me so I wound up working 60-80 a week and a lot of time running the deli by myself. Walmart frowns on so much overtime yet holds the supervisor accountable if somebody gets overtime. Yet we as supervisors are not given the power to hire & fire our crew.

"Fun, easy place to work at ",Walmart is a great place to work at. However their policies on minors still being in school is ridiculous. I think it kids need to work more then Walmart should give them that opportunity to work more and also advance in the company.

Your schedule is always all over the place, you will never get your benefits unless you beg, and they use you like a rag doll.  They WILL work you like a dog and WILL take advantage of you. They do NOT care about your well being trust me. Don’t work here and save yourself some time. ",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Florence, SC",7/22/20,2020,7,22

I’ve never been more miserable at a job,"With the Covid crisis going on working as a janitor has gone from a usually stress free day to being stressed all the time because our workload has tripled, our department has seen a mass departure and we’re now a mere three people, and management doesn’t care. A typical day for me now is going in, learning who’s at the screening table for employees and who’s at the front doors for customers, trying to get as much done as I can by myself then getting yelled at by management for not doing more, and at the end of the night I debate how badly I want to keep this job. The increased workload isn’t what gets me, it’s being left alone then getting treated like garbage for not doing by myself what a crew of 3-5 could get done. Look for other options before working here, all the management is scum and deceptive.

They act like they care, they try to teach techs to care, but when the time comes that concerns are brought up it is very clear that management does not care and just tries to damage control and pacify without actual change.

Horrible Management and Always Overworked,I really enjoyed the people I worked with at Walmart but management was the biggest downfall. They never knew what was going on and didn't really do much. They would do anything to keep someone below part time so that they didn't have to provide benefits. The pay was alright but I was working overnight. Also even as a stocker I was required to man the register if they wanted me too. They were always understaffed on cashiers so they ask for that a lot. The problem is cashiers get payed more but you don't get paid that much to fill in for one also that wasn't the job I signed up for so it is ridiculous that I was required to do it.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Spokane, WA",7/20/20,2020,7,20

"Good for the Short Term, But Please Stay With Your Original Long Term Goals","I got hired to work as a  front end cashier at first last summer. Yet, within  a month  in which I kept being moved to at least 3 different departments.  At first, I didn't know much about the boss other than the fact that seemed kind of hyper and high strung.  I did hear that an employee had left the company because of issues with the manager. At first, I thought it was just that particular person who did not seem to like their job, namely that the individual would tend to wander off._x000D_    As time went on, I found myself having a hard time sleeping at night and I was getting sick.   I have severe problems with my allergies.  It did not help me that I was basically forced to work outside.  As time went on, I winded up calling sick 4 times.  Even with doctor’s notes, I was basically told that  I could get terminated for being late and for missing work.  It did not help me that the store was not really close by and there was a lot of traffic on the way to work._x000D_	It did not help me out that the bosses seemed to bully people in the area I worked at.  On the last day I was there, the boss tried to start a physical confrontation with me.

It’s retail,"I’ve worked at another location for diary/frozen. The problem most people have is when we’re understaffed and it’s really stressful to get everything done. As a cashier, stocker, or zoner it’s all easy work. It does get boring. It is hard on your back and knees. Even as a cashier it’s hard on your feet to stand for 8 hours a day without movement. Self checkout is nice that you get to move around. Sadly I wish there were more people at work who actually liked their jobs. I am a friendly and bubbly person. I actually love helping people. In self checkout I feel my help is productive. As a cashier it’s just very repetitive, I feel that way as a stocker too. Sometimes you have too much to do as a stocker. Other then that learning to work in a team is great and on the front end learning to work alone is great. I’m also trained in the gas station. That is great because you are in a separate building, away from the chaos, stress, and negative environment. It’s great when you work with someone you connect with.

To Sum it up so Far,"I've enjoyed my time with the company and have very few issues with the other employees. The E-commerce or OGP department is a very fast paced work environment. Just a few employees  who don't act professional and some others in the back who don't like to work! Walmart is a self teaching environment and is full of work. Non-stop busy and always on your feet!

Either of them will have to be out to avoid any manager confrontation. Didn’t used to be this way until we got 3 new managers. They could care less of your concerns. NEITHER of them have any prior experience working in the trailer, but will tell you how it should be done and write you up if it’s not done how it is in the video they watched at their orientation.

It all depends on the environment. From day 1 at my store, I felt welcomed and I haven't left. Wal-mart does provide and offer great benefits.

Before the mask mandate we were required to sign a waiver stating that even if employees caught COVID-19 that Walmart would not be held liable. Management is subpar at best, the deli sucks no matter what location you're visiting, and it's generally difficult to advance within the company alone. I had to fight tooth and nail for my position because one single csm made it known that I wasn't one one of the favorites and she was going to do everything in her power to make sure I would not be getting a promotion along the front end, despite completing all of the required training for the area I was going to be jobcoded towards.

Lots of back stabbing, HR is racist and fails to create a diverse environment. Overall if the management was better it would be a great place to work. However management is awful . On weekends I worked with maybe 4 good managers  2 were in RSR and 2 were shipping on the dock. The rest were either idiots, rude to associates or a combo of both.  Remember at Walmart you are cannon fodder, this place will dump you quicker than your first high school sweetheart and they'll hang you out to dry just as quick. They aren't your friend, but they'll kiss your butt and make you feel like they care.

Monotonous work ,"Walmart is heavy on SOP, or in their language, One Best Way. They have every aspect of most jobs laid out for you. Everyday you will have an ordered list of tasks to do and times for how long those tasks should take.The vast majority of the work is simple and even enjoyable on occasion. Problems will arise not from the actual work but from communication and relationships with coworkers and customers - both of which can often become tense, awkward or even confrontational. Walmart has an abundance of management. You will have various salaried managers, leaders in various departments, and you'll get frequent visits from market and regional teams. Trying to juggle all the expectations and demands of the multitude of leaders (which can often conflict with one another or with One Best Way) can be both stressful and frustrating.If you are willing to deal with the stress and perform through it, there are plenty of promotional opportunities.. Hard workers do get recognized. Workers who are reliable, available and productive typically are awarded full time status within a year or two of their hire date. There are also bonuses given out quarterly for stores hitting sales and customer service goals. Overall Walmart is what you make of it. The pay is low for most positions and most associates are part time. That said you can promote. Supervisors can earn 30k-40k annually and those positions are numerous. The work is not difficult. It can be stressful. The hours vary tremendously based on position. I would highly recommend taking a position with a morning shift if available.

Management are lack of knowledge and doesnt really do well on decision making,"Job in Walmart was not compensated with the work I have. As a Manager we were trained based on the job we are handling.

Ok job,"Ok job.  I worked full time hours for 6 months before I was actually ""full time"", so I didn't get benefits until then.  I think the wage is to low.  Its actually hard work.  Impossible to live on 11.22 an hr.  With the company pulling in BILLIONS, I think we should get a higher wage.  They can afford to pay us better,  but don't.   We did receive ""bonuses"" during this pandemic twice.   Full time employees received $300, part time received $150.  The fact that they brought in a few extra billion world wide, that was pretty pathetic.   We are considered ""essential"", and should have been paid extra hourly.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Caldwell, ID",7/17/20,2020,7,17

Good place to work if you like routine and familiarity. ,"Good pay, atmosphere depends on the management team of your store. If they are good people things will mostly go smoothly.

"productive, poor management ",the hardest part about the job is actually having a good team to work with and the management does not care who the hire for any department they do not take anything in to consideration.

Would not recommend ,Started off as a cool job until I realized they showed favoritism to certain employees. Management here is very unfair and unreasonable.

They will find the most stupid things to fire you over.,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Bartlett, TN",7/17/20,2020,7,17
Some team work and belonging ,The managment team is rough and demanding with unrealistic expectations.

A year and a Half,"I worked as cart pusher at my local Walmart for what feels like a year and a half. It wasn't easy, as some things were broken at the store. But the pay was good and it was nice, walking around and helping people if they needed it while pushing carts to keep the lot clean. It's definitely a more important job then I thought, as without carts people can't shop. Carts roaming the lot can be a danger to customers.

Fun place to work!,I enjoyed working at Walmart. There was typically a new challenge everyday. New challenges bring about personal and professional growth. The starting pay for a young adult entering the work field was fair.,3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Macon, GA",7/17/20,2020,7,17
Not bad but not great either,"I worked at Walmart as a sales associate in apparel for over a year. There were many days I worked and just wanted to go home simply by being at Walmart. The more hours I worked, the more sad and even bored I felt. Now, this job is probably the easiest one you could apply for at Walmart. Which is great for anyone who is looking for a new job or want to do something easy. But if you get lucky like me, managers from other departments will take you out of your department and make you help them instead! I hated this the most because I didn’t come to Walmart to work in multiple areas at once, and would know little to nothing about the other departments cause I’m never over there in the first place! I also didn’t have very communicative co-workers, so that took away some of the fun I expected to share with others to make work less miserable. Some of the co-workers my age (17–18) or slightly older didn’t always do what they were supposed to, so I would end up doing what they didn’t do. I don’t know it just wasn’t a very comfortable or welcoming environment working there for me personally. Although, of course the pay is pretty good and get a fair amount of benefits. So theres that!! Anyways, if you are looking to really enjoy working somewhere new, for the love of god don’t choose Walmart. You can do better than that lol.",2,Former Employee,Sales ,"Germantown, WI",7/16/20,2020,7,16

I have NEVER worked for a company that cared so little about their employees.I spend 4 years in this place and, while the pay was great, this company actually HATES their associates. They are a financial BURDEN to walmart. Problems are ignored by management, the trash in this building is a huge safety issue.There are literally six foot high piles of trash all over the mod. The break room isnt big enough to accommodate the number of employees so people have to sit on the dirty floor to eat their lunch. People complained about the break room issues and this PIECE OF ST COMPANY closed off half the break room.  Thats how #### walmart is. We say look, people are sitting on the dirty floor, we need staggered breaks and they CUT THE ROOM IN HALF, making less room. What kind of company does that??? One who HATES their employees. Dont even get me started on the mandatory overtime, which was 6 days a week for 11 hour days for 6 MONTHS. Miss two days during peak, youre fired. The mod is littered with clothing that falls out of the bins and people run it over with their pick carts,then its put back into a bin, soiled and opened, and shipped out to a customer.

Worst job Ive ever had,"I was a full time stockman at a very busy location for 6months. I was forced to work 6 Days in a row, but was not getting paid overtime. Would understand if it was a small company but this the BIGGEST company in the world. We NEVER had enough carts. Only had around 100-115 shopping carts. The electric mule broke at least 5 times by other people while I was there;  so we were forced to manually push around 10-12 shopping carts at a time. Manager would scream and yell at us to hurry up; she made us feel like it was always our fault instead of helping and asking what's wrong. I witnessed a female manager yell and belittle my male coworker to the point of tears and no disciplinary action was taken against her. Coworkers were fed up and would sit in their cars and take 30min breaks.

Management will do anything they can for you as long as they see you making an honest effort to do your part.

It can be a sweat shop atmosphere ,Management is alright for the most part. Some are just aholes. You can work your butt off for no reason. Sometimes you will spend hours zoning (cleaning/organizing isles) to come next day and everything has been relocated. Sometimes you feel useful but many times useless. One manager will say one thing and another something different. It's all about pushing product out regardless of how it looks or if pricing is right on it. Customers get short end of stick which is wrong in my eyes. ,3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,San marcos ca ,7/14/20,2020,7,14

Walmart is a good company to work for.  In most part they work around your needs.  They do care about their employees.,The only problem I ever encountered at work is with some of the co-workers.

Good starter job,"Overall Walmart is a good job if you are trying to get back to the workforce. However, it is not a place one should make a career out of since of lack of opportunities and getting more money per hour. Walmart (at least when it concerns their cashiers) pays everyone the same, no matter how long you have been there or how hard you work. For example, you start with 12.00 per hour and eight years later, you are still working for 12.00 per hour. ",3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Lancaster, OH",7/11/20,2020,7,11

It's very much like a confusing relationship. But it's not.,The ASM in Online Grocery is an amazing human being and she will have your back (as long as you aren't BS'ing 24/7).Coworkers around the store are pretty cool but almost *almost* everyone with any bit of power are complete asshats. Walmarts way of doing things can and almost always is full of ignorance but works on a company wide scale. Wish they would allow room for flexibility because doing things one way DOES NOT WORK FOR EVERY STORE. I do not know why that is such a hard thing to understand but it is. If your manager has any bit of common sense they will try to bend some rules around but they are legitimately putting their own job at risk by doing so. If you and your friends can get a part time job together I definitely recommend but once you're out in the real world I would not stay. Pay to work ratio needs a lot of improvement across the entire store.   Can I give chopped up stars? 3 is a quarter too much.,3,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"West Chester, OH",7/7/20,2020,7,7
Wouldn’t recommend,The managers talk about the employees their. Walmart was the first company I worked with that I experienced racism from both managers and associates.

"Be prepared to never have a life! They will work you like a 1910 slave. They don’t care if you’re sick or if you are dying, you better show up to work","HR at my current store is very rude. Management sucks! They don’t care about their associates, all they care about is having you in place when needed. They work you long hours and be prepared to work every single weekend. They work part time associates full time hours and they don’t give you full time benefits. It’s so much drama that you’d think you were back in high school.

Not to bad of a place to work ,I normally unload the truck and separate boxes that come off the line (conveyer belt )onto carts or pallets. Once the truck is offloaded we go to break. Once we come back from break we are assigned departments to stock and then we take our freight to the freight to be worked. I haven't learned much working at the company that would be useful in other jobs. The management can be mean some days depending on their mood or what kind of day they are having. a few managers I am cool with. The workplace culture is quite diverse. There isn't really hard about the job I currently do and I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing my coworkers and getting to stock my favorite department. ,3,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Long Beach, CA",7/6/20,2020,7,6
Not Sam Walton's Walmart Anymore,"I have been at Walmart for the last 10 yrs. Since the new Walmart CEO took over working at Walmart has been getting less and less pleasurable.  The new Walmart way is to do more with less. Less people to do work and less management. where you once had the opportunity to advance has been severely limited due to elimination of most mid management.  Most Support Managers, Department Managers and Supervisors are becoming a thing of the past.  Hours are set by a computer program so you might find yourself closing one night and opening the next morning",2,Current Employee,Electronic Sales Associate ,"Skowhegan, ME",7/6/20,2020,7,6

"Things that stands out about this job are things like competitive pay, polite customers, and rude customers.","While working at Walmart, I’ve realized there are many pros and cons. Some include dealing with rude customers, dealing with polite customers, and competitive pay. Dealing with diverse customers are expected when working a service desk job. I appreciated when customers came in with a positive attitude, it really made my day. Whereas when customers came in upset, it disrupted my day. One thing I’ve learned is not to let your emotions get the best of you, keep pushing through no matter the situation. Also, competitive pay is another pro of the job.

He was not going fast enough for the my manager. The older man was struggling to talk when the manager was being loud, and mean to him. This caused the manager to get even more angry at him. This type of action does not fly with me. It took everything I could to not interrupt what was going on. The manager Is also very rude to all of the employees. The manager contradicts everything that is happening at all times. I personally am looking for a new job to get away from the catastrophe that is happening here. The people are very nice and I enjoy talking to them when we can talk like normal people instead of having to be told to work even though we are still working: I would not recommend this job to anyone even if you a student or this is your last option.",1,Current Employee,Cap team 2 ,"Hays, KS",7/6/20,2020,7,6

"If you can ignore customers, give it a shot...","If you don't have a problem basically living and breathing for Wal-Mart and the absolute abominations called customers that walk through the doors, then you can give it a shot. The pay is better than minimum wage; however, you will be belittled, yelled at, and called the most awful things by customers every single day (especially if you work as a cashier or at the customer service desk). At the end of the day, I would rather get paid a dollar or two less an hour at a less toxic and hateful work environment than have to hate my job so much that I find it difficult to smile outside of work. Happiness is more important than money... Also, do not expect to be able to stay home ever... even in the middle of a pandemic or if you are seriously ill.

"A Corpocratic workhouse, but with decent pay.","I have worked with Walmart in two stores and several locations. While each place was different, behind closed doors they are often identical. They will always have a task for you, even when there is no work left to do, but there will always be toxic or harmful workplace politics influencing how each particular store or facility feels. This was my first job after graduating high school, and it introduced me to real life. I enjoyed the pay, the work, and my coworkers and immediate supervisors. Often the hourly associates are always welcoming, even if the cashiers are all new and inexperienced.At the end of the day, you will be sore if you gave an honest days work, but it's not bad work.",2,Former Employee,IMS Associate ,"Dawsonville, GA",7/5/20,2020,7,5
"Constant drama, hostile environment ","If you decide to work here. Watch out, things have changed since new management. There is constant drama, micromanaging.

Managers are hired with no experience and act superior and don’t follow their on rules and don’t expect to ask for their help or if you have questions, they have no clue and expect you to figure it out yourself. The clinic is constantly closing with no advance warning so you don’t make enough hours a week for what you get paid. Constant unnecessary changes in policies. The EMR system you use is through an app and unsecured sites which makes it slow and always crashing. No place for advancement and your raise is determined by if your manager likes you not by your hard work.

So much  discrimination !! People got fired for points when other people got to keep their jobs no matter how many points they had. Management would just make points disappear. It was a very stressful job. Customers treat you terrible. I would never work for Walmart again and I will tell everyone about my experiences there so they do not make the same mistake.

Great money bad management,Great first job but there isn’t really much room for advancement unless you move to a higher ups position. They also have an automated computer system that determines if you are late or not which sounds simple until someone plays with your schedule and you show up at the wrong time and get penalized. The worst part about being penalized is they can’t go back in their system and see who is changing your schedule. The managed get away with doing things like that constantly.

Lots of potential career growth.,"There is a pride one can find in Wal-Mart; the daily stride of coming to work and adapting to today's perpetually flux market. Finding a clear linear path through each routine task can be rewarding, as each day presents new challenges in the form of customer demands and expectations. Wal-Mart has set itself apart in that expection to always exceed -without clear limit- customer satisfaction. Stories of upper management having to mow customer's grass for failing to refund a lawn-mower, or accepting a return on a tennis racket purchased from a competitor, and other tales are touted with passion. This atmosphere has led to a mix of long-term employees and short term ones, with far differing opinions of where the company is going. One thing being clear, it's not going anywhere soon. In my experience, I have learned to take on tasks simply by being available to help. The tools and resources at my disposal was never short and I need only look to my peers for insight. I have held many positions with the company and found that the sky was the limit with where I wanted to go. On the negative side, with the company's constant drive to stay relevant and leading in the market, the company often pits its employees against one another, and falls back on ""bootstrap"" work ethics to justify its failure to honor long-time employees. There is an inbred sense of dog-eat-dog among the leadership. Job security is never certain, with a constantly evolving structuring of roles and responsibilities. In the 4 years I have been on the management side of things, 8500 managers were laid off in a single - more...",3,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"McComb, MS",7/4/20,2020,7,4

It was a good job,"My typical day at Walmart is I come in clock in get my stuff that I need and put the rest in my locker they provide for me, then go to the computer and do some online work which is did that for a month while I started working there. Then when I was done with them I go to the area I applied for which was the Fabric and Craft are seen my trainer done some training for an hour or so  then do some stocking till lunch and then did the same after when I was done just did some zoning which is to organize areas the are out of place or pull items from the back or fine products that don't belong there/in that area and put them in there right place. I do all that the rest of the time of my shift till leave to go home.  What was hard about the job was the shipment schedule's whenever the trucks come in I never know when they normally would go back to get the stuff to put out on the stock or when there's stuff over stocked in shelves the sections I never know the right place to take them cause that item been moved out or they rearrange the stuff in the back. Another thing that was hard was the scanners/the price maker I never knew much about them cause no one taught me before till like a month in a half working on the floor that some taught me when they were training in another area of the store.

Stressful and Highly Unappreciated,"If you love working for a place that treats you very poorly and stresses you out to the max, Walmart is the place for you. You work so hard and get paid so low while the managers and Corporate make all the money. Fun Fact the DJ for Walmart radio Makes 6 figures a year. Another fun fact is that the store managers get a 100k bonus once a year if their sales in the store are at a certain percentage and if associates need hours and the store cant afford hours it comes out of that 100k bonus the store manager gets and trust when I say the store manager will do everything into his/her power to make sure they get their 100k bonus even if they have to do lay offs. The managers and supervisors do nothing but walk around and talk while the associates do everything. I believe strongly that the main associates that do everything and need to be paid more is cap 2 team they unload trucks everyday even in 100 degree weather and they are expected to get most if not all the work done in the store, while associates in electronics or sporting goods or service desk stands around and talks including department managers.

So I asked my manager if I could learn how to do OGP, I was given permission and trained and after months of working in both OGP and dairy they would not allow me to switch over and be given a raise, so I requested to learn how to do other departments and months after that I was still not given the opportunity to work in another department or given a raise. I did my main job so well though, I stocked 1132 gallons of milk and all the eggs in one hour after being threatened by one of the managers. I was always alone in dairy and I worked hard to get everything done. I made a name for myself as sad as that is at walmart, I just wanted to earn enough money to go to france and so I tried to earn an advancement. Little did I know that the best thing I could have done was stay a ""nobody"" and never give anyone a reason to look my way twice.The managers were disrespectful, rude, and emotionally abusive. I was harassed, followed out to the parking lot, accused of time theft for using the bathroom because I was apparently supposed to clock out first, and on one occasion grabbed by one of the co-managers there for wearing a jacket (while working in the freezer).

Avoid this place or at least be warned beforehand.,"This job will tell you everything you wish to hear when the interview process takes place. I recently moved back to the area, I have over 15 years of experience and long story short, this company could care less as soon as you're hired. One lady i worked with, had been there for over 10 years and they treated her so bad, it was a big reason for me quitting. She was the backbone of our department but management would give her the worst shifts and as of me leaving, she was cross trained and working in 6 different queues. They knew that she had a couple more years before she could retire and they did whatever they could to use her. It was sickening honestly. _x000D__x000D_COVID made things a lot worse at this job. They are now taking employees who have been in their roles for 3+ years and moving them to CR and other positions without even telling them. One coworker was a licensed Optometrist who worked in the Optical department. She has been with the company for a long time also but recently has been taking CR calls and not even optical calls anymore. Imagine going to school for many years to learn a craft/ skill to then be reduced to a glorified Walmart punching bag because the company can't use any of their billion dollars to just hire more people. _x000D__x000D_Being as transparent as possible, they allow their customers to curse you, call you racist names, and all kind of egregious things and all you can do is ""try"" to deescalate the situation.

IMO(In My Opinion),"I worked for Walmart in 2016. I left because of the $9 job, but when I heard that overnight was hiring for $12, 40 hours guarantee I was all for it. Turns out after my 6 months and making 11.50, they didn't even offer to bump me up even though I was a hard worker. And the 40 hrs, they'll schedule you 40 then 33 then 40 again just so they didnt have to make me full time or give benefits, I guess. I did ask about it and was told that, ""Yea I really want to see you get paid the right amount and you have been here 6 months"". 2 weeks went by and I found another job. Didn't have time to be told you'll help, then give no help. One time I asked the lady manager if she could get me another box cutter because mine broke, and she said she would be back and never showed back the whole night. The next day I seen her I asked her about it and she said she's going to be honest, she didn't feel like walking all the way over there to get one. Everyone complains about the heat because there's no A/C on the pets, garden side of the store. Mainly older women works here, and the lady I worked with(20 yrs experience), I was hearing that she makes you do the work. She was ok at first, then she started giving orders and I didnt see no point of telling/asking Management.(20yrs exp). They transferred the cool boss",3,Former Employee,Overnight stocking ,"Ocala, FL",7/2/20,2020,7,2

Do Not Work Here,"First and foremost: before taking this job I had not left my house in over two months and was healthy. A week and a half after orientation I got so sick I was out of work for 3 weeks and had to be tested for covid. I was negative but could not return to work until I was symptom free. During orientation the HR manager continuously kept taking down and playing with her mask while we were in a small room with two other trainee's. They don't take the virus seriously. My team manager was awesome, but other department leads were hit and miss. A lot of them were rude or spoke down to you. Upper management was a mess, during my time managers were actively quitting or walking off the job due to the store leader/store manager. The break room has a sign telling you to social distance but the HR leader consistently breaks the guidelines by having a huge group eat with her at lunch every day and thus putting everyone at risk. I was also accused of stealing when they hadn't even checked the case where equipment is stored before confronting me. The machine was where it was supposed to be and the associate responsible for keeping tabs of that stuff was rude to me. They work you to the bone and there's chaos constantly. They pay you bare minimum while the hike calling you a ""hero"" over walmart radio all day. Don't waste your time.",1,Former Employee,Mod Team Associate ,"Millville, NJ",6/29/20,2020,6,29

Growth opportunities for good ole boys only,"Sexist, racist, and discouraging environment. Little opportunity for growth unless you're a white man.

As a temp or permanent you are put under pressure to meet certain goals.,"Online grocery pickup and personal shopper are very physical jobs and you will have back problems. This applies more to the grocery pickup than the shopper, although shopping can involve moving very heavy items. You bang up your fingers a lot. The frustrating part about shopping is, items being out of stock or in the wrong location is a constant. You cannot get anything done due to constantly being asked questions by customers. You are not given clear criteria as to what you can substitute for missing items. Customers are very rude on the floor and shop as if they are the only ones there (cutting in front of you, blasting carts out of aisles without looking, blocking aisles). If you don't know where something is and tell the customer, they walk off in a huff.

Walmart is a place to start your career and get used to the work field it is a great starting place,Walmart is a good starting job if you want to get into the work environment.

Immature leadership,"There is no organization in the way the stores or the company is run. Walmart cares for neither the ""Associate"" or the customer. That is shown in their poor decision to eliminate all cashiers. After I left, corporate made that same type of decision as it relates to HR. Walmart's new policy seems to be, ""DO IT YOURSELF"". If you want and employer that is concerned about the welfare of it's employees, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.",1,Former Employee,Garden Center Associate ,"Maplewood, MO",6/19/20,2020,6,19
Walmart is not about its employees,I would never work for that company again. All they care about is the all mighty dollar. Employees are not treated fairly.

Fun relaxed workplace. Steady work. Positive enviroment,Wal-Mart is a great workplace. The environment is very relaxed. Coworkers are very supportive most of the time. Managers are always watching to ensure your experience there is 100% positive.,4,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Paducah, KY",6/19/20,2020,6,19
It’s great and all but...,"I had a great time working at Walmart for an extended period of time. Typically, the managers were there to listen if you had any problems personally or with another individual. For the most part, you could rely on coworkers. The biggest issue was always understaffing. Some days I was expected to cover 4 different areas within the store, while having to make sure my area was perfect. It became very unrealistic when I needed to continually run back and forth to help everyone constantly having to ask customers to hold on while I help someone else.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Battle Creek, MI",6/19/20,2020,6,19
Would be a great job if management could get their act together,I really enjoyed working with the people in the shop here. Inside management disrespects and mistreats you though so it's really only a stepping stone,3,Current Employee,Automotive Service Technician ,"Lexington, KY",6/19/20,2020,6,19

Great Environment but no tools to succeed,As a CAP Associate I am expected to do things fast and effectively which is a realistic expectation but when everything is in the wrong location and I am not given the tool that allows me to locate where items belong it makes it very difficult to stock items and put them in the correct locations.,3,Current Employee,Cap 1 Associate ,"Indio, CA",6/19/20,2020,6,19

Poor management. They Expect too much.,"First of all I have to say, the jobs and tasks are not at all what I am complaining about. I absolutely love the job itself starting from the computer to the backroom then the sales floor. Let me start by saying that this review is specifically about the store in Mililani, Hawaii on Oahu. This walmart is completely sexist. We recently opened up various management and one supervisor position however all positions were supposedly filled by females. Not one male made it through the interview stage regardless of their experience and/or character. Our store only has 2 male’s withing management and they barely made the cut when they got their shot. However the training was completely helpless, as of someone in CAP2 they expect too much from us, and the management has horrible communication skills and teamwork! Not to mention, “Integrity” is what the stores saying is but they could never live up to that after what I have experienced. Walmart is one of those companies that lure you in with benefits and sweet talk but once you’re in... you would want to get out quick. Training is paid however it will feel like you’re getting paid just to get fired. Managers and supervisors are not the ones who train you, fellow associates are. I remember I was being trained to take longer breaks and lunches then almost got coached/terminated for it. Thus, I got in trouble for something in which wasn’t completely my fault. After training everything seemed fine until our shift (CAP2) were getting railed left and right by us not completing our jobs right and being compared to graveyard shift. This is not - more...",1,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Mililani Town, HI",6/19/20,2020,6,19
Trash,The management sucks. They are biased and there is a lot of favoritism within management making it hard for equal opportunities to move up or switch to higher paying departments. The scheduling is very poor they never schedule associates within their availability and never give overtime and are constantly cutting peoples hours. The workload is always heavy and you are barely given any time to finish it. You also work alone most the time and wont receive much help from anybody else.,2,Current Employee,Cart Associate ,"Mililani Town, HI",6/19/20,2020,6,19
Stocking,Just do you very best and you will get used to it and always listen to everyone around you to understand everything so you can get better. But also doing the truck will be the best about the work,4,Former Employee,Walmart ,"Tucson, AZ",6/19/20,2020,6,19

Unfortunately they are getting worse and worse everyday,"Integrity used to be important, & then that stopped, so the respect I have for this company has dropped tremendously in the past few years. Nothing matters anymore except for whats on 'paper'.",3,Former Employee,Support Manager/Department Manager ,"Eureka, MO",6/19/20,2020,6,19
"Constant frustrating, never enough time",I think I’ve said it all. They treated us like dogs. Unrealistic expectations and never grateful for what we did. Some of the Managers are sadistic. Some are ok. Not to mean all of them They still commanded respect. But most everyone hated working there.,2,Former Employee,Night Stocker ,"Lenoir City, TN",6/19/20,2020,6,19
Cap 2 associate,I worked as a seasonal  Cap 2 associate.   It involved helping unload  and sort freight then stock the sales floor.  Stocking requires memory and handheld equipment .

Distribution Centers are Awful,"Whether associate or management, communication is borderline non-existent. Insane hours and people treated like punching bags by any superior. Schedules flip constantly, nothing is planned out or if it is, it isn’t communicated up and down the ranks. Each shift operates completely differently. Necessary tasks sit untouched for ten times the required time, but senior management always gives home office the thumbs up. All issues are blamed on the people at the bottom",1,Former Employee,Area Manager ,Southern VA,6/18/20,2020,6,18
Insurance Benefits and Job Advancement,"Wal-Mart during a typical day you go in and work 2 hours, get a 15 minute break, work 2 hours, get an hour off the clock lunch, work 2 hours get a 15 minute break, work 2 hours and then it is time to go home. You have the opportunity to receive insurance after 90 days and they have programs to help you complete your GED or even go back to college to advance yourself in the company.",4,Current Employee,Service Writer ,"Columbus, IN",6/18/20,2020,6,18
The benefits were good.,"Walmart is a fairly good place to work. They offer good benefits and raises. Only thing I dislike is the point system. It doesn’t matter if your child is in the hospital, you would still get a point taken off.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Dyersburg, TN",6/18/20,2020,6,18
Do NOT recommend,"Worked for the company close to two years, they don't treat employees with respect. When it comes to breaks, they ""forget"" or are ""working on it"" (even if it's almost time to clock out for the day they will use these same excuses). Practically anything good about this company, is washed out with management fighting you every step of the way when attempting to use your ""benefits"".",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Carbondale, IL",6/18/20,2020,6,18

Good First Job But Could Be Better,"This review would be referring specifically to the West Flagler store, some aspects of which will reflect the company as a whole. Overall, pay and work culture are good and the benefits offered are attractive. The only problem with benefits is that you start to earn them after months of work, even longer if you're a part time employee. Another problem some might have with working at Walmart is a seemingly distant management. There seems to be a deep divide between hourly and salary workers only made worse by language barriers (hourly workers tend to speak more Spanish while most managers barely speak it). Walmart does offer good experience to those who need it, but unless you're trying to move up in the company, I can only call it a good starter job.",3,Former Employee,Food Service Associate ,"Miami, FL",6/18/20,2020,6,18
Upper Management is what controls all,"I started out loving this job and enjoying every bit. But after a few good AMs left I now am constantly micromanaged and put into positions where I can not win. Otherwise, if you are lower than a DM there is little balance for those as shifts are either 4am to 1pm or 1 pm to 10pm. Also if you are not in OGP never expect to be given priority or extra help.",2,Former Employee,PRODUCE MANAGER ,Oklahoma,6/18/20,2020,6,18

Everyone Comes For A Paycheck And Nothing More,"Between its high turnover rate and uncontrollable hours, Walmart is a place where 90% of the employees are there for the sole purpose of acquiring a paycheck and surviving the day. Ironically this situation can create an atmosphere of friendly commiseration among you and your coworkers. The other 10% of the staff is almost entirely composed of upper management who aren't there long enough to feel the soul crushing desperation that the average worker experiences on a daily basis.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Malabar, FL",6/17/20,2020,6,17

Fair paycheck,"Walmart is a wonderful company for somebody looking to get a fair paying job right out of high school or for someone who needs a job right away to get back on their feet.

Perfect example of how a company should NOT be with people,"I dedicated my life to Walmart for 8 years. Busted my Body every single day, worked overtime when needed, volunteering to come in on days off. Worked multiple departments, was always considered the second in command. Funny thing was, even though I was doing the department leads job, I was never offered the lead position...instead I was told I needed to TRAIN THE LEAD. The managers are complete morons. They are so racial there it’s funny. This place will kill any sense of customer service you have in you. They use you up and throw you away. If you get injured at work, it’s off to a drug test. If you have to file for worker’s compensation, they will find a way to make you quit. Targets are on you if you complain. They will promote their pets; those they are having relations with, or those that have suck a suck up personality, regardless of how they work. The harder you work, the more they put on you, the LESS opportunity you have.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cape Coral, FL",6/17/20,2020,6,17

Good place to start,"I was finishing college and saving money while working as a pharmacy tech. good pay for no degree. they pay for your license and certification exams and online program which is needed to take the exams. I was dong this online program at wal-mart on the clock which was really great. flexible hours, my manager was amazing and kind. she worked with my hours of school but still tried to keep my work hours the same/what i requested.  each location is controlled by the pharmacists. so good manager and shift pharmacist good place to work. unfortunately, the reverse is true. stressful job, lots of customers are upset with their life/health/ doctor/insurance and you have to deal with that. some customer though were understanding and sweet, again it all depends on location. those who are nice always seem to be nice no matter what situation had happened and those who were mean were always mean no matter how much i tried to help them. if you dont work at a neighborhood market, chances are your store is at least slightly busy and you will be required at some point to do three or four things at one time. ex. count pills while calling a doctor office and be on hold on another line for an insurance claim. you get use to the fast pace after a while. felt that i shouldve been paid 2 dollars more an hour for the stress and workload, but still a pretty decent job. the company was doing some changes as i left and the techs position was changing. not sure whats going on now but as i left they were requiring more work from the tech as they got rid of the cashiers and want us to do more stuff. biggest - more...",4,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Cooper City, FL",6/14/20,2020,6,14

The only thing good was the money,Wal-Mart does not care about their employees. They are not fair to their employees. They show favoritism. They don't care about you when you get injured. I got injured there and i was treated a little like an outcast like i didn't matter. The managers always spoke to other employees but i would have to say something in order for them to even notice i was even there.

Walmart ,Walmart is a good place to start out when looking for retail work. I really enjoyed my 3 years working for Walmart but I had to leave because Walmart started a new scheduling system where you work 13 weeks of the same shifts/days off and then to have it be switched again 13 weeks later for different shifts and you also have to sign paper work as well for this. I had did this and the assistant mangers not only lost my paperwork for this scheduling system but somehow managed to put on my paperwork to keep switching me from full time to part time. ,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Cibolo, TX",6/12/20,2020,6,12

"Typically busy workplace, decent coworkers, rude customers","I hadn't noticed until after at least 5 months of working for the company, but there is a great deal of hypocrisy, nit-picking and favoritism, at least at the WalMart I worked at that is. I cannot speak for all other WalMarts, however, I was told of other store managers at different locations that questioned the ethics and poor behavior of the Customer Service Managers, Assistant Managers, and even the Support Managers. I had seen coworkers of mine get reprimanded for doing things that I would then watch the managers go and do themselves as if they hadn't just disciplined an associate for the same wrongdoing. The hypocrisy was horrendous and it made working there a bit of a pain, some days it was practically unbearable. Not only that, but it sometimes felt like it was difficult to trust anyone because others would speak badly of you when you weren't around. The only upsides I could think of was that the amount they paid hourly was decent, the lunch breaks were an hour long, which gave ample time to rest and eat a good size meal, and that the schedule hours were consistent for the most part. The best part of the job was knowing that I made a lot of customers happy because they'd almost always leave with a smile on their face after I helped them with something. Even if a customer was rude to me, I did my best to smooth things over with them so they didn't leave the store in as sour a mood as they came in with.",3,Former Employee,Self Checkout Host/Cashier ,"Tampa, FL",6/12/20,2020,6,12

Bad managment,"Couple of assistance managers come to you with a attitude for doing your work, how you were trained to do it saying your supposed to look busy even if your job is to wait for customers to come pick up their groceries when ever they come, and it can be about a hour before they come.

Okay place to work at if you are experiencing an emergency.,My experience at Walmart was both good and bad.  Too many managers and sometimes they conflict with each other.  Also the tasks have a tendency to outweigh the number of people working.  Company has a tendency to implement new services before hiring extra staff.  Not enough flexibility on the days I would like to have off.  But the pay was okay and the extra bonuses were a blessing.  Also the lunch period was one hour long and two 15 min. breaks in addition.,3,Former Employee,E-Commerce Personal Shopper ,"Katy, TX",6/11/20,2020,6,11

Very poor company and terrible management,"The management in my store is very terrible at making the associates complete the work in an efficient and organized way, let alone even stick to the company’s own work culture and guiding the associates to a sensible way of doing the work. I feel like the whole management and the associates themselves just barely if at all have any sense of organization at all at any time! I mean I see managers just trying put work on other people to  get away with the boss and clock out! I see associates leaving their carts in the back and clocking out before time. Customer service is obviously terrible as at every Walmart because of how the company itself trains the managers and associates.

Awful,"So working for Walmart is just like the experience you have shopping there, awful. I answered the phones for my Walmart store and it gave me anxiety because I never was able to help a customer get to the department they wanted. Also, they are not flexible with you if you go to school or if life happens. There was a time where I needed to go visit my mom out of town, I got the days approved off, but needed to stay one more day to make sure she was all cleared by her doctor. Walmart gave me a point for that. There was also a time when my professor changed an exam date. I tried explaining that to my HR and all she told me was that I needed to switch days with someone or call in and take a point. Well I had to call in and almost get fired. My HR lady basically told me i needed to choose what was more important Walmart or school. Also management is sucha joke.the actual store manager is the only one that works and treats you as an equal. While the assistant managers just yell at you and make you look like a fool. The support managers and department managers work the hardest and have their best interest in you.",1,Former Employee,Apparel Sales Associate ,"Abingdon, VA",6/11/20,2020,6,11
3 stars,This place is great. I really enjoyed the job aspect. My only issue is that they hire the biggest idiots for management.

I admit my response was inappropriate, but at the moment I didn't care about the $11 salary or the job.  I said, I noticed the mixed breed in your cart.

Productive,"I have worked in three different stores in Michigan, under 6 Store Managers. Only one felt having a clean receiving area was more important than having a clean sales floor.  My Asst Manager supported this, and encouraged over stocking of displays and stuffing the shelves just to empty the back room. Knowing that by doing so would create a messy sales floor. In the apparel department, this is a very bad idea, customers don't pick items up off the floor, they drive their carts over the top of it! Once marked, or damaged in any way, must be donated or tossed due to damage. THIS IS IRRESPONSIBLE management of company property!  All Department Managers work 7 to 4 without question! Even if there was a need for management during later hours.  As the closing Asst. Manager generally is not available when needed._x000D_   The employees form a close bond with one another for support, and better training that was not given from Department Management.  _x000D_   However, not all stores or managers are this way, do your research, ask questions of the employees before applying.  Employees will tell you the way it is at their stores. The general consensus from many is, Walmart is a great place to work!  And with the exception of one store, I would agree! Most of my time with Walmart was an excellent experience! My management was good, I was never left hanging with a ton of stuff to clean up after they had gone for the day. Job assignments were clearly stated, each sub-department was covered by another member of the department.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Greenville, MI",6/10/20,2020,6,10

Poor and rude management,"I worked here as a summer job. When I tell you I didn’t now anything about cake decorating, I’d never touched a cake in my life. These people put me in there knowing I had no experience, and would get annoyed when I asked for help. The management was so rude. You can tell they really don’t care about their workers, but care about getting stuff done. I was always hearing coworkers complain about different things. My job was easy only because my coworkers were nice to me. I didn’t even meet the manager until about 2 weeks in. They weren’t really worried about making sure their workers were taken care of. I feel like I was always on my own about stuff. Everyone would always talk about quitting and I guess I was the only one who did. I had a friend there who quit a few months after me because the mangers were just so rude to him to.

Glad I got out.,"When I first started working for Walmart it was great. I enjoyed the work and the people I worked with. There was promise of increasing pay, bonuses, benefits, full time hours and promotions if you worked for them. The first year I was there was wonderful. After that, the company’s true colors came through. I ended up transferring to another store so I could finally get the full time I was promised a year earlier. Then I spent three years there. Every time a raise came around I was just bumped up to the company’s new minimum pay. So people who were being hired in were making the same that I was or in some cases more than I was which didn’t seem fair. The management at my store was garbage. I can’t speak for every store but my specific one was awful. There was one or two managers that were actually good. Other than that, they didn’t seem to care about my area until corporate came in and said things were being done wrong. My department manager was pretty awful and by the end of my time there my manager wrongfully wrote me up to save their own self. I was passed over for promotions even though I worked the hardest in my own department and applied for multiple positions. They never interviews any of us that actually worked there. They would hire outside people and not give anyone within the walls a chance. I could go on but that would take way too much time. Long story short, I’m not sure if every Wal-Mart is awful to work for but mine was.",3,Former Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Wilmington, NC",6/9/20,2020,6,9

Salary increase should be considered,"It’s an ok job, but way too much work for the salary pay. $11 doesn’t compensate for the hard work, they should greatly consider $15 an hour and probably more people will stay and reduce the continuous turnover.

I have learned a lot about retail and fresh products. The management is great and is always willing to assist throughout the work day. We have a wide variety of workplace culture.

"Physically demanding, poor management","I was hired as a temporary associate as a result of COVID-19 demand; however, I never received formal training of any kind so there was an extremely steep learning curve. I asked for up to 25 hrs/week during school, but after the first couple of months I started being scheduled for 30-40 hours. Both I and a few of my coworkers experienced having our schedules changed after they had already been published. The most difficult and frustrating part of the job was when we were given freight with no location on the box and no scanner so we would just have to walk the aisles trying to find it. There were multiple days when we received two trucks of freight instead of one; management rewarded us for our ""hard work"" with a handful of candy. No hourly hazard pay - some bonuses went out but largely inadequate. Management lectured us fairly regularly about proper procedures; mind you, they were rarely laid out clearly in the first place. Overall not a great job but if you're willing to put up with poorly communicated, seemingly constantly changing corporate policies you'll do fine.",2,Current Employee,CAP 2 Team Associate ,"Mesa, AZ",6/8/20,2020,6,8

I am a fast worker i multitask a lot also help other associates out with no problem. The hardest part about working at Walmart was standing on the line for about 3-4 hrs a day stacking items on pallets nice and neat but i made it look easy but standing was the hard part.

"Always watch your back, unless you wanna get fired quickly.","I currently (but perhaps not too long) work at my local Wal-Mart, and I'm here to give my honest, and most inclusive review of working at this store/location. First off, I was hired as an Assembler (basically building bikes and grills, with occasional handy-man type work here and there) on PT. (Part Time, meaning at the most, 40 hours a week, no more) My first day of the job, was really confusing because my trainer was missing... which was odd according to HR and the managers. So I was then put at the front as greeter/receipt inspector. On my first day, as an Assembler, I was doing AP Customer Host work. The manager of that job was so ""impressed"" by my greeting skills, that I ended getting PROMOTED. Yea, first day on the job, and already promoted? From PT to FT like that? Well, there are some caveats. While I did get a pay increase, I wouldn't actually start seeing that increase until working a month, which I achieved 7 days ago. So now, I'm an AP Customer Host. With this job, I've noticed that anything you say, will be thrown back at you. Have a crush at work? Trust me, give it a day or two and people will find out, and that crush will find out, and things will fall apart. Have a grievance with someone there? Boom, an hour later, EVERYONE knows. It's sad really... I didn't think Wal-Mart would have such a hard pressing environment, so full of toxicity. I've worked in factories, and NEVER have experienced SO MUCH toxicity COMBINED the likes of Wal-Mart has. Not only that, but managers do not, and I repeat, DO NOT stick up for you, and if anything, set you up to fail. I'm a honest - more...",3,Current Employee,AP Customer Host ,"Plymouth, IN",6/8/20,2020,6,8
It’s Your Decision,"My time at the company was mixed. I had some good days, and I had bad days. Recently, all of my working days were bad. When I was a member of the closing shift for the department, we lost people via firing or transferring to other departments, and our manager never hired more people like he said he would. There are some managers in that store that were sweet to the associates, and worked with them, b the other managers only cared about themself. It’s your decision if you want to work for the company.",3,Former Employee,Fresh Production Associate ,"Pekin, IL",6/8/20,2020,6,8
RUN AWAY! No matter how badly you need a job.,This is absolutely the worst company I have ever worked for. They are a very micro managing company who uses humiliation and the constant threat of terminating one's position if they make even the slightest mistake. This is by far not an exaggeration or an over statement. They will hire employees full time and then they will cut their hours to part time so they then do not have to provide benefits to those employees. I would advise extreme caution if contemplating taking any level position with this company.,1,Former Employee,Pharmacist ,New York State,6/8/20,2020,6,8
Maybe a good summer job for the pay,"It was pretty decent when I first started working there almost 4 years ago, but this particular store has gone through so many drastic changes since then.

Pays more than other retail pharmacy technician roles,"My time at Walmart Pharmacy was short but an extremely better experience than other pharmacies but still terrible as working conditions for pharmacy staff continue to decline. The customers are better mannered and thankful for your service. Management tries to work with schedule but are only allowed so many technicians on staff. A huge benefit is 30 minute lunch closure giving technicians and pharmacists a well needed break. This pharmacy pays better than others but still not enough for the amount of work they expect you to do. It is high stress, fast paced, high volume work. The company (like others) does not understand the lack of safety involved in short staffed days, high volume of prescription count without daily limits and they continually add more tasks for technicians and pharmacists to take on. The culture here is poor. The pharmacy staff is consistently harassed by store employees so most techs and pharmacists eat in their vehicles outside.",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Pinellas County, FL",6/7/20,2020,6,7
Stay far away,This is the worst company ever. They are always figuring out ways to give you less hours and less pay. The good workers will get sent to do other people's jobs . They take raises away. Impossible to earn time off or get sick time. Nobody's cares about your problems on either level of management. No overtime. Any overtime you get they make you cut the next work day.

They put all the Hispanics with the Hispanic area manager, all the Burmese associates under the burmese area manager and so forth. It is a warehouse completely segregated by race, and it is a very uncomfortable work environment. It seems like the building I worked for adheres to racism and segregation and I didnt like it at all. They also DO NOT care what you have going on at home and there is no flexibility when it comes to overtime. You also wont know you have to work overtime until the day before.

"Retail: Stressful, fun, and rewarding","I worked for Walmart for 16 years.  I enjoyed most of my time with the company.  It is a place of opportunity and growth if you desire it.  Within my time I was promoted five times and relocated three.  Each store I worked in had its own culture and were stores of the community.  Retail is not easy and there were more long days than short.  It is easy to lose a work/life balance and you work most holidays.  But once you accept the fact that you are there to serve your community and customers, you understand your sacrifices and find worth in it.  It does not always make it easy, but retail is not for everyone.  And that is okay.",5,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,OK/TX,6/5/20,2020,6,5

Fine place to work,"I think with all pharmacy jobs, it depends on the workload, the amount of customers, and who your managers are. The pay here was significantly better than others in the areas, and our work volume wasn't as high as the CVS down the street. It became taxing once upper management switched around and wanted the job to be more focused on customer service than actually getting the job done. I 100% believe we should treat the customers great - but I also know that just being nice doesn't get the job done. It was annoying to have co-workers who didn't know how to do the job reap all the benefits because they got great comment cards. If you'd rather promote friendliness than knowledge then...okay.

Stressful and no sense of leadership or organization,"From what I have noticed and heard from other associates, the owner of the store has no clue how to be a manager. The associates can be quite rude and not care about their jobs. 2nd shift has no sort of management and they leave a mess for overnight associates and maintenance to clean up and fix. For overnight, the managers and supervisors do not show any appreciation for their associates.  They take their work stress out on the associates by pushing them more to where they cannot work any better than they are doing, and our work never seems to be enough for them. I have worked my butt off every day and still get treated like I did not do anything or like the associates that actually did nothing all shift while I picked up their slack. The overnight managers also love to keep people that do not work or break rules just because ""it is a body"" to have around, and they love putting those people in dairy (mainly) because there are multiple people working there already, so there are people to accommodate for their lack of work. People push themselves too much for the amount of work and lack of appreciation that this store has. _x000D_I understand the stress that goes on in running a store and managing it, but the way they deal with it is not the proper way.

The area of the store, has a diverse clientele. at times can be very dangerous downtown at the neighborhood market. Management also talks about employees in the break room with employees not showing a sense of leadership.

We work all holidays except Christmas, they do not give employees holiday pay. Bonuses vary on your position, how many hours you work each week, and your attendance. This company does not care about their employees. They cut hours so much people can’t afford to pay their rent or buy food.

Great opportunity if you can keep up,"Employment at this Walmart distribution center was crazy. Firstly, the pay is great, I've never seen a better hourly rate for warehouse associates aside from here. The work life was the typical clock in, do your job, clock out, repeat, but after the training period is over it all changes. This place has the worst management I have ever witnessed in a logistics department. They preach about helping everyone and ensuring success when in reality you are simply a number on their production report. _x000D_To put in perspective: out of about thirty new-hires with me, I was the only one left after six months due to management consistently writing people up for instances out of their control. _x000D__x000D_My final judgement is that I honestly learned quite a bit about the supply chain and logistics industry during my tenure with Walmart and even received a great hourly wage.
