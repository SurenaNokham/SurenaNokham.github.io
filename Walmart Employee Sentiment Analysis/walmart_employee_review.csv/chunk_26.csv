They catered to the lowest common denominator and ignored the highly trained people.I'd seen the same people making the same mistakes for over a year and still have their job. Others who where more competent were fired for very random and innocuous reasons. The management ruled by fear. Fear of losing ones job.

Wal-mart sucks!,"Employees are treated unfairly. Not paid enough by any means. You work 30-40 hours a week but are only considered part-time so they don't have to pay for benefits. No over-time is allowed, any hours worked over your shift, you have to take off of one of your days before the end of that week. For example, I worked 12 hours and still only got paid for 8.I had to make sure that I took those 4 extra hours off of one of my days before that week ended on Friday.

"hard work, little benefit","This was the 2nd time I worked for Walmart and i was paid even less. They paid the night stockers 1$ above day time hours.

fast paced friendly faces and a great management team,I liked working there. It had a very positive work environment with co-workers and customers alike. I learned that Walmart cashiers have a lot on their plates they carry out a whole lot of duties on their jobs. Between getting all the things that people changed their minds about and putting them where they need to go to helping someone change a payment from debit to credit. Its a different experience for every one but mine was definitely a positive one. The management was always willing to work with me when needed and other cashiers as well customers never left unsatisfied. They solved customer complaints and helped customers with finding things in the back room if needed. The hardest part of the job would be trying to keep bags on the bag carousel. All the cashiers know each other and act like a small front end community. If a new cashier or even a cashier that's been there for a while needs some help some one is always there to lend a helping hand. The most enjoyable part about this job is just the customers themselves. They just have the best attitudes when they get to the register. Their positive attitudes made my positive attitude even better. Smiles are contagious and it was and still is my pleasure to make someone smile at some point in his/her day.,4,Current Employee,Front End Cashier ,"Kingsport, TN",10/1/17,2017,10,1

"Retail giant, with lots of job positions.","The store level crew can make it or break it, overall the company is so-so. They are strongly anti-union, and often try to push you as close to full time as they can,all the while keeping you just under, so they can avoid giving you benefits. So if you are looking for a job with benefits, I recommend looking elsewhere. Unless you are looking for a management position. Of the two locations I worked at, the first one was one of the older, smaller stores, and had a much nicer ... family feel, everyone tended to look out for each other. The second was a supercenter and it was understaffed, at time leading to a single overnight stocker working an entire department by herself.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Dover, DE",10/1/17,2017,10,1

They want you to shop as an employee bring the money back to our home store get treated poorly as a employee and customer!!! Managers shows to much favoritism.. This company have a lot of perks.. they need to take the bad seeds out. Mangers show favoritism to other managers.

We're not happy 'til you're not happy,"Management is incompetent. All decisions are made by home office types who know nothing about working in an actual store.

The more you know the less you are promoted,"The work enviroment was so stressful it was toxic. The number of times I or a co-worker would get in trouble for something we did not do was sickening. There are a couple of associates in particular I had made friends with, they costantly applied for open management positions and were more than qualified having worked in the store for years. Yet even though they were best suited, the one even has several degrees, the promotions were always given to people who either didn't know the area or had been trained by them. I find it ridiculous how many people have told me if they did not need a job they would leave and I can not blame them.

"Good benefits, poor hours","The work is fairly standard for what you'd expect from a large chain retailer, but the hours are inconsistent each week and it's hard to balance life outside of work with inconsistent hours. The benefits are surprisingly good as a full time employee, with a good and affordable healthcare plan, time off based on your hours worked with the amount increasing as you stay longer with the company, 401k matching (up to 6% at time of writing), and a 10% on a majority of the products offered.  The management is spotty, with some being good and some being poor to work with.  The store tries to push  on the company and If you enjoy retail Wal-Mart is not a terrible place to work but if you do not enjoy interacting with occasionally angry customers or do not like the idea of retail as a career it is not the place to look into long term.",3,Current Employee,Paint Associate ,"Trinidad, CO",9/29/17,2017,9,29

Solid community of workers,The employees that worked at Walmart all got along great because we were mostly all in the same boat. Almost everybody got along well with management and there were never any issues that became public knowledge among the employees.

Wal-Mart is not a horrible company their managers are horrible,"Wal-Mart would be a great company if they learned to take care of the people who take care of their customers. In my opinion, there are far too many horrible managers. They don't have respect for the individual because they don't give fair opportunities for promotions. They give the promotions to their friends, some of which are not qualified because they don't even take their own assessment. Managers have also been known to remove people from positions to give the position to their unqualified friends. They do not act with integrity, even though there is a no retaliation policy, they still retaliate. If employees use the open door policy, they may lose their job or their position because of management retaliation. Many associates have experienced these behaviors but are not willing to speak up out of fear they will lose their job or be retaliated against. So, no I will not recommend Wal-Mart as a place to work.",1,Current Employee,Department Manager/Customer Service ,"Houston, TX",9/28/17,2017,9,28

A Stepping Stone,"Rather than drag Walmart through the mud, I can say that it is certainly a good starting point in employment. As far as careers go, though, I could not honestly recommend it.

A simple place to work at.,"A typical day at Walmart for me consist of emptying our general merchandise truck, sorting said merchandise into the different sections of the store they belong to, and at the end of the day, cleaning up the backroom and setting it up for the next day. What I've learned from this job is that you have to be quick and efficient when it comes to assigned tasks. You must listen and fully understand to make sure you do your job correctly. I believe that our store's management is fair at most times, but needs to really start listening to their more experienced members for feedback on how the job can be done more efficiently.",4,Current Employee,Associate ,"Folsom, CA",9/28/17,2017,9,28

I learned that while it's good to do your best, your work ethic and initiative can easily be exploited. The management in my opinion was less than mediocre. The work place culture was essentially people barely skating by on their tasks until someone else decided to take care of it. The hardest part of the job was even after completing all desired tasks to the best of my ability, the feedback I received expressed the notion my work wasn't good enough.

Are the shelves stocked? Are there any special displays to put up?  However, in the Electronics department you are asked questions by customers about every single thing in the department when you know precisely nothing about the items and have had no training on them.

Not the best place to work.,"Depending on what your job title is you can be out on the sales floor folding clothes, cleaning spills, stocking shelves or you can be on register helping customers purchase their goods. I learned how hazmat works and how to claim out merchandise that was broken or tampered with. The management really was horrible. They would schedule very few people to work in certain areas and then call them to go to another area to work and when it came to the end of their shifts they would get in trouble because nothing was done in their departments. Also if you somehow got injured on the job they would write you up saying that you were the one at fault even when it wasn't your fault. Associates were nice but then you have some getting in relationships with others and causing problems, way to much gossip, not the best place to work. Good work experience for people who are just starting out.

I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart,I was one of the few employees who actually liked working for Wal-Mart.  Most employees were hard working and helpful and easy to get along with.  Pay was reasonable depending upon experience and education.  You do get benefits after working there for 1 year.  Management was very poor.

Fast-paced but fun,"A typical day at Wal Mart was fast-paced but lots of fun. I learned that if you are fast your line stays full. The management there was stand-offish with employees. They didn't talk much to the employees nor got to know their names. They only talked to you if there was a problem. I never understood this. The manager over the whole store did introduce himself to the training team but never spoke to me again. The workplace culture was a team, we were ""work family."" They were always eager to help out in any way they could. The hardest part of my job was trying to find time to get more supplies. I didn't want to keep asking for others to help me out when they were busy too. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting the customers through the line as quickly as possible and hearing them say, ""you are fast, thanks.""",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Thomasville, NC",9/27/17,2017,9,27

Walmart was a fun place to work,While working at walmart I made many friends.  We were indeed at a work place but they made it fun.  It was a fun and caring place to work.

Very friendly work environment with amazing associates.,"Working at Walmart as a cashier, you learn a lot of things, especially about your customers. You would come clock in and get on a register and start checking people's groceries out with a smile. The management would always know how to make you smile or laugh if you weren't already. Of course, there were certain managers that could make you laugh and smile way more than others. But I felt like the only hard things about this job were when manager got onto you because you didn't do something the right way or when a customer screams and curses at you because they don't like that you're not agreeing with them, but you just have to put that behind you and move on. Even with the rough days, there are good days. You have good associates to work with and you have amazing customers who love you.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Dallas, GA",9/27/17,2017,9,27

There is a specific way that things need to be done but from store to store adjustment are allowed.  If an associate has a suggestion it is discussed and implemented for the good of the company.

Electronics,"Will give you hours and few months later will cut hours, not only in electronics but in all departments. The management in this store does not treat all employees fair.

Not an exciting place to work,"A typical day at Walmart is long and sometimes with the right staff very Friendly.  I am not prejudice by any means, but, sometimes people can be very cold in the work place especially Walmart. The Manager does not smile or speak when he sees one of his employees and I spoken just to say yes every time I saw him.

good hand on skills,"There is no ""typical day"" at Wal-Mart. There are procedures and processes that happen at various times. This is a retail environment that deals with many levels of customers on a constant basis. Then there are all of the exceptions to the rule that seem to pop up at various times. Overall company leadership is good and supportive. The company is very technology based and is constantly evolving to meet the needs of today and tomorrow's customers.",5,Current Employee,Cart Associate ,"Hartford, CT",9/26/17,2017,9,26
Poor everything,"The management there is full of lies. No advancement, no raises,no intensives,no thank you, no positivity at all! The management will not let you advance if you are good in one area. They put you down never telling you what you do is good. It is always why is this not done, you are not good enough. They other thing that I see is that they management all wants things done their way so you have 4-5 different managers tell you what to do and it is always different. There is not support and the managers don't defend you at all. They expect you to do you job and any other that are thrown at you! You never know when you are going to get ripped into and when you are going to get passed by. There is no respect at all.You are not trained but rather thrown in to the work and expected to know what it is that you are doing.",1,Current Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Springville, UT",9/26/17,2017,9,26
Good Pay,Good pay but the constant going back and forth between morning/mid/night shift from day to day was extremely difficult to keep up with and manage a life outside of work.

Really place to work,"A typical day working at walmart would consist of serving customers first, cleaning, helping customers with problems or concerns they may have and helping them find anything they are looking. What I learned working at walmart is just being patient with people and learn to keep cool under stressful situations. The management was okay fair but very strict. The hardest part about working at walmart wasn't really anything i loved working at walmart.

Not easy but simple,"The work at Wal-Mart is fast paced and for me pretty worth while, however you are usually left hanging in the wind by managers and so many of your co-workers are tired and dislike working there so they are there to help you out when you first start so you are usually left to fend for yourself. The customers are usually alright however you can get the awful ones quite often easily getting you in trouble if you don't give them exactly what they want. As I often like to say to new people this job is not easy but it is pretty simple, but if you like working hard and enjoy seeing a good job accomplished then Wal-Mart is the job for you.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Murfreesboro, TN",9/26/17,2017,9,26

Its ok.,"Pretty standard retail work. The management was kind of poor at the store I worked at, not to say others are the same. Hours were getting less and less before I left, like a full-time employee was only getting about 32 hours a week which is actually part-time because they didn't want to pay benefits. Store manager was rude to employees when I worked there.",3,Former Employee,In Stock Team/Sales Associate in Toys ,"Palm Bay, FL",9/26/17,2017,9,26

ok,"Walmart is not as bad as everyone says.  It pays well for managers.  Sometimes, you do get stuck with subpar colleagues due to their need for management.

Enjoyed the majority of the people I worked with!! But the lack of teamwork is unbelievable which comes from management.,"All in all a good place to work if you just go in do your job and go home.

Worst job i ever had!,"I worked for walmart on cap 2 for a few years. In my experience it is like a military style boot camp that you get paid for. Under paid at that, For all the stress they place on you with their insanely time limits that are unrealistic they scold you no matter how much of a hard worker you are. If you didn't match the time frame you will be belittled, humilated, in tears wanting to rip out every hair you have. They make you feel worthless, useless, they play favorites. & for some they will not fire you they will make the work place so intolerable & unbearable you are forced to resign. If you have low self esteem this job is NOT for you. Management gossips about you behind your back. Barely any days off & if you tell them you have a family they will guilt trip you. Overall horrible place to work!",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Sheboygan, WI",9/26/17,2017,9,26

"Fast-paced, but a fun work environment","Every member of management is there to help you succeed. The employees are respectful of each other and eventually are almost like family. Friendships are easy to build as each member of staff is friendly and willing to help at any time. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with customers that had a difficult attitude. However, if the employee has thick skin or understands that the customer is just irritated at whatever had happened to them and remains calm, the experience is easy to overcome. Luckily, dealing with an irate customer is a rare experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to so many people and to hear their different experiences.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Lindon, UT",9/25/17,2017,9,25

okay place to work,"Many people that I worked with there had made it a career and had been in multiple positions within the company. During the year I was there, several people went from part time positions to department managers and one department manager moved to a different department management position that paid more. They are supportive about both moving up within the company and transferring to different stores. They're also good if you're like me and only want to work part-time, valuing balance over additional hours. I had no trouble receiving approval for a specific day off requested whether it was paid or unpaid. Their point system for call offs makes it easy to know where you stand; no worries about whether this call off will get you in trouble because as long as you stay within points, you're golden and no one will say anything.",4,Former Employee,Associate ,"Fernandina Beach, FL",9/25/17,2017,9,25

Not enough home time,"170 days a year away from home. It was a  great place to work but as the years passed, management changed and started adding rules and regulations that made it difficult to do your job.  They change the delivery schedules and made it tight to deliver on time.  They initiated new company rules on cell phone usage that was above and beyond federal regulations.  No phone calls over 10 consecutive minutes and no more than an hour a day.  Being away from home days at a time, that is ridiculous. They demand to audit your phone bills to make sure you obeying company policies.  They put cameras in the trucks that are forward facing and rear facing so they can see the driver and monitor what the driver is doing.

The managers work with you to complete your tasks, answer whichever questions you have, and encourage you to perform as expected. They have a high expectation for the amount of work you have to complete per the given time period. You have to complete all assignments before your shift is over, clean up after yourself, and make your area presentable.

Poor leadership in the store and no direction for employees.,"Walmart has a 10 ft rule to greet and assist all customers but most employees do not practice it or care about it.

One days you can have hours and the very next you check and your missing a whole 6 days from your schedule. You ask management about it and they promise. ""Oh I'll fix it!"" so you keep checking and hoping that someone will and NOTHING gets fixed. Don't even get me started on the lack of cashiers!

A good place to start,"The work is often clear and straight forward, at least after the first few weeks, depending on who you're learning from. Be prepared to ask a lot of questions from your supervisors and fellow associates as there won't often be someone around to help make sure you know what you're doing. _x000D_As long as you can get along easily with the people you work with it can be low stress. When starting off, customers will frequently ask you for the location of one item or another. Don't be afraid to admit that you don't know, as most of the people you work with should know, and be glad to help you and the customer when searching for it. And once you've had more experience stalking the shelves, knowing where to direct a lost customer can turn into one of the most satisfying parts of the job. _x000D__x000D_One of the most dissatisfying parts of the job however, has to be dealing with the managers. In my experience they often give as little attention as they can to the logistics of completing tasks around the store and yet they will be the first to complain to supervisors and employees about how one thing or another isn't finished. They will usually do this without providing any physical help or making any real changes at all. There was one instance in which I'd stayed late, having not even been asked to do so, in order to finish stalking a large amount of product on the juice isle.

Nice customers not much flexibility in hours,I liked working at Walmart. Most customers were nice. I had one supervisor that needed to go back to communication school or something because she always talked to me as I were a child and not as her equal. There is a lot of gossip and people like to skip out on work to take unscheduled breaks. _x000D_The management was good maybe some too friendly instead of managerial. The hardest part of the job was finding another employee to help you when the traffic started to pick up. The most enjoyable were the customers. I really liked helping others.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Little Rd., Arlington, TX",9/19/17,2017,9,19
A typical adult can't afford to work for Wal-Mart.,"If you don't have four roommates, or you're not living with your mother, then you won't be able to afford to work there. Starting hourly wage is $9. After three months it's bumped up to $10 and you'll get an employee discount card for 10% off some items. If you have no dependents, no cable/internet, car loan, cell phone bill, and get on food stamps, then you might be able to afford to work for Wal-Mart. Scraping by with no money for fun on the weekends or saving up for a rainy day is not worth it in my opinion. It might be okay as a second job, part-time. But honestly most Wal-Marts are going to want you to work like you're being paid $20 per hour, and most of your coworkers are going to be smart enough to not do that. Good employees come and go quickly through Wal-Mart, while lower caliber ones are in like a tick. Wal-Mart isn't all bad, but if you've worked for other companies you'll know you're being taken advantage of.",2,Former Employee,Service Writer ,"Lee's Summit, MO",9/19/17,2017,9,19

I am responsible for knowing the ""waves"" of freight and making sure that all freight is worked on a daily basis. This becomes to be the most difficult part of the job due to prioritizing what is the most important for the business. During the seasonal holiday, the daily tasks that are expected to be completed on a daily basis now are at the bottom of the list. So managing my time and work is a key factor in having successful departments. The one thing that I enjoy most about Walmart is the continuous changing. The company has set dates and seasons that we know we are busy, but I really enjoy the building of displays and seeing the hard work executed.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Janesville, WI",9/18/17,2017,9,18

my experiance at wal mart,"I worked hard for wal-mart and i went out of my way for them and when my grandpa had a stroke and we didn't know what was going on whether he would live or die. I had 65 hours of vacation time to use and because it was December i couldn't use my vacation. They told me if i went to see my grand father that i would get written up. and after that it felt like i was getting harassed and like they were looking for any little thing to get me in trouble for. one week they would tell me that rules had changed, and the the next week they would change them back after i already did it the way they told me to the last week. They couldn't write me up but they would call me to their office and fuss at me and one time made me apologize for doing what i was told to do. So i lost the excitement i and drive i once had to the point that they threatened to fire me without say they were. they told me i needed to pick up my work performance in a week or we would part ways and quit wasting anymore time. i worked here for 3 years and i used to do just about anything for these people and this is how i got treated. I was always there. i had 65 vacation hours in December. that means i barely even used my vacation. if i had that why did i get fired for attendance? they wouldn't let me use my vacation and made me take write ups.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Sales Associate ,"Pickens County, GA",9/17/17,2017,9,17

Its not all what its expected to be...,"Walmart culture was expressed to be very important once hired. Employees are expected to process invoices or receivings for walmart stores, prep them for annual inventories and continue to make sure stores and vendors are in compliance with payment procedures to prevent unnecessary shrink (loss of $). Great Sr. Director who truly cares about her employees, unfortunately the mgrs, supervisors and some division leaders are not on the same page. Unprofessional environment at times, individuals from outside try to bring their own mgt techniques which is not the Walmart moto.. A lot of fraternization in the workplace, hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant changes of processes which have not yet been finalized after 3 years.

Alot of learning but its worth it,"Walmart is great environment too work and learn quite a bit I enjoyed working at Walmart all the way until my last days there, The work is always there their is always something to do working overnight one of the biggest things you can do is learn to work all departments in the store that way your knowledgeable of all department for several different reason first off for knowledge of the company also if a customer asks you something you want to have some idea of what they are talking about for the best customer service. There will be good and bad days sometimes call off or don't show but thee work has to be done I liked the idea that some of the managers would come work with us if we need help or just to learn their team better and then you have some that won't knowing that something couldn't be finished which is terrible for the crew as a whole...But the experience is priceless their are always a few bad apples but I never let that ruin the bunch I do believe that upper management should step in when they know is a manager is wrong or bogus I also understand that they have protocol that they must follow but the employee shouldn't have too suffer which was the case with me I would still recommend someone too work there business is still good and their is plenty of opportunity there",4,Former Employee,overnight worker ,"Glen Ellyn, IL",9/15/17,2017,9,15

The management was okay some days and some day the wasn't. The culture when I first started working there, was fun and I didn't mind going to work, but then once I had been there it got bad.

Should have transferred,Typical day would be getting cussed at and yelled at by department manager and other associates. I learned that there should be more abilities to have a sounding board for issues when management does not listen. Management is poor. Workplace culture is supposed to be you have respect for other people. This store does not carry that culture. Hardest part of the job was the hours.

Not as bad as many people think,"I worked for Walmart for 12 years. For the most part it was fun working there, I made some lifelong friends and received good working habits. Working environments change from Walmart to Walmart but I've worked in two stores and no real problems. Customers could be mean and whiney at times but they are customers. Most of the times you work in teams to accomplish tasks; which helps pass the time. The only issue is if u want to move up to management commitment to Walmart success is a must so no playing around too much and pay doesn't translate to the work that you put in, if that makes any sense.

Sales Associate,Working at Walmart is horrible. I would only recommend it if you have nothing else and really need the money. The management sucks they only help you out if you help them out. When home office comes they change their attitude and act like they care and like the store is always clean. They are racist what one associate can get away with the other can't. They show favoritism. You work like a slave and you work is unappreciated they pay is poor the raise sucks. They act like they are family oriented but they aren't.

It's an easy job. Stock the shelves and put away your cardboard. Management varies depending on a person's personality, but overall they are there to help you as long as you do your job. The coworkers were supportive and friendly. The hardest part of the job was making sure all tasks were done on time. It is fast paced. The most enjoyable parts were the coworkers, interacting with a few customers at night, and knowing what to expect with your tasks once you become accustomed to the job.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Madison, AL",9/15/17,2017,9,15
Walmart is a Big Corporation,"My personal management was great. The rules were strict but for a place that large it makes sense. Customers could make or break your day.

good place to work if you are willing to go to management within 6 months of being hired,"Walmart is a cutthroat place to work and if you do not advance within the first year or so you are there, you will rarely be promoted.  In fact, if you don't go higher before your year is done, you might as well quit because you will be stuck in the job you are in for a long time.  Walmart only cares about the almighty dollar and tries hard to get people to move up since so many managers end up quitting or getting fired there.  It is a stressful place to work for a manager and for a associate.  Time is very critical and somehow they expect you to get 9 hours of work done and make the store look pretty in the 7.5 hours you are there.  Sometimes it can be done, but mostly it cannot and something suffers.  The managers take heat from the store manager, and then the managers put more pressure on the workers to somehow go faster, like we can somehow slow down time and space to make such a thing happen.

Great place to work if you reakly need tye money,"They don't know what they're doing as a corporate business. The benefits are great and they pay decently enough, but the people on top are just making money and  not caring how the stores are run. They do the absolute least and worse work they can and expect the poo to run downhill and get picked up by the store workers, causing confusion, stress, and the inability to properly and safely complete tasks throughout the stores work forces. They dont order materials half the time and they hire less then as many ppl as they need and workers oick up multiple work loads as a result. OSHA needs to run through the stores and fine them and get them in gear.

B/S management with a high turnover rate.,"Management does not value their employees or there work efforts.  Again, working with a Spanish speaking culture was very difficult.  Didn't speak complete English sentences.  Management wasn't available if you needed help or in answering questions.  They were going in ten different directions.  Lazy, overweight staff who were very slow in getting the necessary supplies when I needed them.  Management didn't tackle the important issues or in settle disputes between co-workers.  Like I said BS management.  Only tackled the petty issues that didn't relate to the job operations.  HR was very rude and unhelpful and lazy.

Maybe the non-experienced managers just didn't know what it took to get the job done. That on top of not getting on people to get to work but ask more and more from the people that did work because it was easier than making lazy people not lazy, very frustrating.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Overland Park, KS",9/14/17,2017,9,14

"If you like working for very little money, this job is for you!","I do not believe anyone should work for this company. In my opinion they do not care about the well being of their employees. This is evidenced in the fact that hardly any hourly employees were hired at a full time level when I worked there. This allowed the company to avoid paying any insurance benefits or paid time off. When I worked there I was frequently reassigned to work in the backroom unloading trucks even though my position was that of a sales floor associate. I was not paid any more for working these much more physically intense positions either. Management did not care about if the employees were doing their work, and were apparently afraid to fire people for poor job performance. You are only going to be scheduled for 30ish hours a week, but will be expected to be available anytime.

Corporate run/no common sense,"Typical day is following their checklists and routines.  Corporate dictated.  No room to do what is needed in an individual store.  If you spend too much time on one area of concern you get coached.  Market and Regional AP come in and nit pick idiotic things.  Walmarts AP program is a useless bunch of paperwork that should be done by operations.  If your store has a bad inventory they will never admit it's because you cant focus on what's needed,but tell you, you must not be doing the checklists.",3,Current Employee,Asset Protection Manager ,"Rockford, IL",9/13/17,2017,9,13

I was employed for Wal-Mart for nearly ten years.,"Generally, not a bad place to work, however dealing with management that doesn't always support you, or will not assist you at all based on their own personal opinion of you is altogether discouraging of employment opportunities within the establishment. They offer incredible compensations, employee discounts with various providers and businesses, and a pretty legitimate stock ownership program. 401k, health insurance, life insurance and other necessities are also offered by the company. Management in the store I was previously employed at started out kind and genuine, and would go out of their way to help, however towards the end of my tenure became altogether belligerent, insulting and incapable of taking responsibility for any particular situation. They were willing to bend the rules in whatever way they wanted to, and if they were intent upon terminating an individual's employment, would often utilize underhanded methods in order to achieve said goal. All in all, despite the fact that the management does have a tendency to be inconsistent and altogether unfair in their actions and decisions, the company itself provides a host of benefits for employees, especially long term employees who work hard and seek to advance within the corporation.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Kissimmee, FL",9/13/17,2017,9,13

Good work for hard workers,"Wal-Mart provides a team-based work atmosphere in which an individual works with a team to complete a specific task such as cashier work or a range of tasks such as inventory associates or cartpushers/custodians. Management generally provides an overview of expectations and allows individuals to reach those expectations of their own accord. One aspect I enjoyed of this job was the lack of micromanaging. However I did encounter issues with payment when hours were missed on a paycheck, and several other associates experience the same problem. The solution was unsatisfactory, as they put the money on the next pay period, depriving us of money for two weeks, and causing more taxes to be taken out for some of us because the larger paycheck went into the next tax bracket. There are issues but its not a terrible job.",3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Tucson, AZ",9/13/17,2017,9,13

Dont work here if you have depression,"As someone who rides the line of general contempt for life and zombifying depression this has been a rollercoaster of a job. At times Wal-Mart's free cook-out style of lunches and ice cream parties have made my day or my entire week but in that same breath having 2-7 managers circling your workstation telling you to work faster, cleaner, do things that are far out of your job description, and do it all with a smile..this can drive me personally to the part of my brain in which I realize I am nothing but a worker ant to these people. Valuable if compliant but easily squashed. Working in any Walmart superstore can be comfortable and profitable if you know a few tricks but be ready to sell your soul and know if you try to get it back, it will only be returned in the form of store credit",4,Current Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Fallston, MD",9/12/17,2017,9,12

But the last six months with the company I went through a couple of managers who did their job poorly and made me and my associates who worked under me miserable every day due to thier disrespectful and careless nature.

I learned how to use the register within a week and being on the floor putting up re-shop was kind of a challenge when i first started but it helped me learn where a lot of merchandise was located around the entire store. Management was the only problem I had because they worked on their own time! I always had to wait for change to give back to the customers making the customers impatient and frustrated.... The hardest part of the job for me was mostly nothing!!! Everything was basic common sense. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying customers and how fast time went by when you were very busy the whole shift.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Portsmouth, VA",9/12/17,2017,9,12

Co-workers were nice,Walmart needs to really stop what they are doing and take a step back and re-evaluate what they are doing to the people who work there. They seem to think everyone can move faster than there bodies allow them to. They also think you should be able to do the work of 10 people in eight hours.,2,Current Employee,Department Manager of Maintenance ,"Greenwood, IN",9/12/17,2017,9,12

Very stressful,To much to do without the help. To many managers and not enough other associates. Just a miserable place to work. Taught to run your department as your own store. I believe they prevented us from doing that. I also believe you get to a certain pay and want you to move up or get out. They change assistant managers and co managers so often you are unable be keep up with the way they want things done. Lots of chips on the shoulders there.,2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Ashtabula, OH",9/12/17,2017,9,12
only stressfull if you let it.,I personally  think Walmart needs to follow a chain of command when getting task done. There are to many different managers giving orders to the same person which could be stressful at times. For workers like me who like to get everything done before they leave work it can be a little over whelming if more then one person is giving orders. Also managers need a system for training managers to becoming an efficient. They are not taught how to treat employee or handle irate customers.,3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Baton Rouge, LA",9/12/17,2017,9,12

I was there almost 2 years and worked hard and often got compliments from y co workers on how god of a job I did. But I would ask management to switch positions to something inside because at Walmart the encourage you to advance up, but i would never get an answer back to move inside or I would get the run around.",4,Former Employee,"Cart Pusher, customer service ","Clovis, CA",9/12/17,2017,9,12

"Stressful, Fast Paced","Working for Walmart is fast paced, and they work with you on scheduling AFTER you fight them on it. The supervisors are overworked which then creates hostile environments. The co-workers are nice for the most part. They don't allow holidays off, the only holiday you get off is Christmas day. They don't understand medical problems, so if you have a disability, they most likely won't care. They don't accept dr. notes, so even if you have a reason to miss they still dock it against you.",3,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Tarentum, PA",9/12/17,2017,9,12

walmart!!!,"I worked in the deli at Walmart.  I worked many hours, sometimes not getting a small break. I liked what I did in the deli. I sliced deli meat and such.  I had no problems with any customers. I however had issues with the way some of the employees did their job including the manager of that area and some of the hire up management.  I never confronted anyone because I am not that kind of person. I was taught to work hard in life to get what you want and need. however some of the people I worked with probably didn't feel the same way or so it seemed.  I found myself doing my job and the job of others as well.  as the saying goes... "" To many chiefs and not enough Indians"".. In some cases not enough gumption in some of them. It was not my place to correct them because of their behavior of being lazy. most of the people in the deli didn't respect the manager of that department.",4,Former Employee,Deli Clerk ,"Ponchatoula, LA",9/12/17,2017,9,12
What you'd expect,"To be honest, Walmart was a good job, but between fellow employees, and management, it left more to be desired. There could have been more communication and less personal matters to handle with. Employees range from all kinds of backgrounds, so some days you'll have hard workers, while other days you'll have employees who don't work at all. Everyone making the same pay for different amounts of tasks, it can become a bit stressful mentally, as well as physically. However, apart from unfavorable employees and management, the job itself is rather menial and if able to handle, worth the decent check.",3,Former Employee,Cake Technician/Baker ,"Davie, FL",9/12/17,2017,9,12

Además tampoco ayudan al empleado que de verdad quiere progresar y en ocasiones los estancan.,4,Current Employee,Servicio al cliente ,"Cayey Municipio, PR",9/11/17,2017,9,11

Coworkers made working there tolerable,It came to my attention that there were many unethical things going on between certain members of management and the staff they supervised. Often times certain policies were overlooked because of the favoritism between the manager and employee.

They would always say that customer service is first priority but would never act like it. When ever something went wrong with a customer they would act like it was the end of the world even when it wasn't a big deal. I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. Sometimes customers will try to put the blame on the employee even though it wasn't the employee's fault. Some customers are impatient and some are really nice. It just depends on the day.

World of unrealistic expectations,"From the moment you are hired, they look to get something over you. Expectations are high, too high but, don't worry; too high for management too. Wal-Mart's culture is to get as much out of everyone as they possibly can. Sad thing is they don't train properly and discipline at the drop of a hat. Attendance policy unfairly executed. 9 points in 6 months leads to termination. Some fired at 9, others have 18 and still have a job.

good employees need not to apply,"If you are a hard working employee, do not apply. The management does not appreciate hard and honest workers. You are just a number.

As an example if you can only work part time in the evening, which they will give you at first, then they will force you to open your availability to 24 hrs/7 days a week. If you cannot accommodate them, they will give you hardly any hours. They want a revolving work force so they don't have to offer benefits of any kind. It's all about the bottom line. It wasn't always like this, but with in the last 9-10 months things have gotten horrible.

Stressful environment because whether management liked you or not depended on whether you were held accountable. No consistency.,Depending on the management staff available  and their experience (which at most was minimal) would depend on how the store was run. Many managers did not know policies regarding human resources and therefore there was a great deal of issues.,2,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,CT,9/8/17,2017,9,8

Job stability but limited in-store advancements for highly educated associates,I liked working for Walmart as an HR manager. The pay is less than the industry average but there is a lot of support from vendors and market HR that makes the job less intensive than with other companies. One main issue with a position in the store is that there is little room to grow unless you want to switch from Human Resources to sales management. There are endless job opportunities with Walmart Corporation in Arkansas but I was not willing to relocate.,4,Current Employee,Human Resources Manager ,"Alva, OK",9/7/17,2017,9,7

Managment needs work,Needless to say my manager told me he didn't care about his employees schedules. I don't want to work for someone who doesn't care about their employees. All management does is go around telling everyone what needs to be improved or that this or that is wrong. They never praise you on your work. Besides the managers working at Walmart has been a good experience.

Management was the worst part about the job, they played favorites and often times took forever to do anything you asked them to do for you. The culture of the store i worked at wasn't the best, some departments had better culture but for the most part it seemed everybody was dragging along from day to day. The hardest part about the job are the unrealistic expectations of deadlines that needed to get done even if you were the only one if your department that day. The every day deadlines and big workload are tough to balance if you don't have the right amount of staff.

A complete joke; not to be pursued as a career or longtime job,"The starting pay some claim is good, but have obviously never worked anywhere else. $9, which becomes $10 after you finishing your training is a complete joke considering management can task many things for a lowly associate while supervisors that do less and are more favored get more (up to $15!) That's also another thing wrong with this joke of a company.. the management, they play favorites and act like they're still in high school.

They do not care about the associates' opinions, even though the associates are the ones that are doing the job.  The job itself is not hard but management does not fairly rotate employees.

"Not reviewed for quality of work, but for the brown on your nose.","Management is about as useful as a horn on a scooter.  The CEO seems to me to be letting his father's company fail miserably just like so many previous supermarket type stores that have failed in the past.

Well, lets just say that 15 miles takes a long time to walk when you have to pass a Wal-Mart to get to the one you work at.

But hey, the store doesn't pay for my medical bills, I do.  The store doesn't buy me a new pair of shoes, I do.

Now the bad, large numbers of managers trained to micro manage, the ones who try and work side by side with the associates are the ones who tend not to last sadly. In the last few years we have seen a reduction in full-time new hires, and staffing per shift has dropped, with that comes a larger work load per person and timed completion via a task list. Culture will differ per state and per market, as such no way to judge off of the views of one individual.",2,Current Employee,Inventory management ,"Oceanside, CA",9/5/17,2017,9,5
Worst job ever!,Treated like a dog. Had and injury went to the hospital had to get an operation. Was told I might be fired for missing work because I had no sick days left.

"Cool and nice co-workers, but horrible management","I enjoyed working with some of my co-workers, but the management is not competent when it comes to scheduling and daily tasks. There are many nights that I close the deli department (which is my regular shift) by myself because management fails to schedule you with another co worker when one calls out, they just don't care. Some co workers that kiss up to management get promoted but I would not care to get promoted at this particular store. The pay is also low compared to all the work and cleaning you have to do. The managers can be very disrespectful and condensing by how they talk to you. The most enjoyable part of the job were some of my coworkers who are nice and fun to work with. It is also cool that these coworkers understand the job culture at this store.",2,Current Employee,Deli Sales Associate ,"Suwanee, GA",9/5/17,2017,9,5
"Fast paced, with a variety of cross training.","Purchase Order Control, definitely interesting, I have several areas of cross training such, as Da. receiving slotter, break pack order filler, Pe. driver, This warehouse was one of a kind I was glad to be part of a great crew.

Typical Work day for a temp,I would arrive at Walmart at around 1:55 and clock in at exactly 2:00 everyday. After that I would go to my cap 2 team managers to get assigned to where I would work until either my shift ended or I finished my work in that section. If I finished early I would move on to another area which I was assigned to do. Most times managers would often come to check on the workers very frequently most times in 10 minute intervals. Often there would be large trucks of around 3000-4200 piece trucks and everyone would have to constantly keep pace and work as a functional team.,3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Team Associate ,"Berlin, MD",9/5/17,2017,9,5
STressful work environment,"The best part of my 3 years was when the manager was promoted and I ran the store.  I started with a great boss, who quit 2 months after I started, got the next one who was COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT, then transferred around a few stores handful of good and bad managers. Finally landed at a store with a great manager only to have him promoted 4 months after I got there.  Then again another ungrateful moron who didn't know his job.  Had to go.",2,Former Employee,Manager ,"Fremont, CA",9/5/17,2017,9,5

It's a paycheck,If you don't like dealing with customers & being available 24 hours a day then don't apply here. Hours are cut from your schedule if you don't have open availability (aka: a life or family). Full time will not be granted if you don't have open availability.

Somewhat of a good place to work,I worked at two different Walmart stores and they are all the same. It really depends if you can deal with a lot of stress to work there.

It was stressful,"Despite having a loving staff I found being a Walmart cashier was stressful. I was stressed about the way customers would treat me and my fellow associates. I was stressed about how my managers didn't care for my well-being. My anxiety had gotten to a very bad point, I actually developed a stress disorder while working there and when I was terminated I was relieved of that disorder, though it still surfaces when things get bad. Despite the negatives the people I met were like family to me, and they pay was adequate. Overall I don't think it was a great job for me; but, for others who are more mentally prepared for handling a job such as this I say that Walmart is indeed an OK place to work.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Branson West, MO",9/5/17,2017,9,5

It is a great company to work for.,The company its self is great to work for and has an amazing history. They are always trying to become better. I think that the management at the store that I worked for wasn't the best. seemed to have a lot to hide every time that corporate would come. also had a lot of favoritism. The company is great to work for but I think that they need to rethink the new pay structures that they have. They made it so that new associates are making more money starting out. They took the normal 4 to 6 % raises away from the previous workers and gave them all 2% raises each year for 2 years. now new associates are making just as much or more than associates that have been with the company for more than 2 years.,3,Former Employee,HR Manager / Support Mgr. ,"Nampa, ID",9/5/17,2017,9,5

Fast paced and stressfull,In the beginning it was a great place to work. Good pay with lots of perks and benefits. Slowly all the perks have disappeared and the pay rate has slowed dramatically. I made the same per hour that a new hire would coming in and that's minimum wage. Only reason I stay with this company is because I'm getting older and work is hard to find. Definitely do not recommend employment with them.,3,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Torrance, CA",9/5/17,2017,9,5

Good place to work for the money although they are harsher on their employees,"I definitely enjoyed working at Walmart although I felt as if there was a sense of ""I'm better than you because I get paid more"" kind of atmosphere.

"Good Pay, Decent benefits",Friendly work environment. It is an extensive company with locations world- wide thus allowing anyone to pursue their career as far as they would like.

"Good Pay, long hours","A typical evening at work would be to clean the entire store, work on average 4000 pieces of freight, clear the parking lot of all carts, make sure pallets where organized out back, reset all cash registers and atm, wax, scrubbed, and buff entire sales floor and backroom. Backrooms had to be cleaned and organized. This all had to be done with an understaffed 10 to 12 associates. Normally the sales floor and backroom would be totally destroyed.

Hours where from 8:30pm to 8:30am, often time I was made to stay 1 to 2 hours later. I was told by my manager that my staff didn't need equipment that helps them stock freight.

Horrid,"While they have done a lot to improve their image over the past decade, the truth is that this company is only about the bottom line.  You are expected to get a hideous amount of work done in a single day, on top of trying to assist customers and being pulled in five directions.  You have multiple managers and they each expect their directions to take priority.  And the third shift stocking program does not work at all, the employee turnover rate for third shift is obscene and people work in different areas so the restocking is quite often haphazard at best.  There is more than a slim chance that the pallet of freight that was left as 'overstock' will fit right on to the shelves.",1,Former Employee,Zone Manager ,"Amsterdam, NY 12010",9/5/17,2017,9,5

Okay,The workplace is not a bad workplace to be apart of but it's not the greatest either. Some shifts have great managers others not so much. It can be cutthroat at times whether they keep people because of policies it just depends. Management could be better at times but most of the time try to overwork employees in certain areas and not show appreciation to employees that bust their tail for them on a daily basis. Most employees just try to get the bare minimum because there is no incentive to work hard. The work isn't hard just your typical warehouse work in all the areas of shipping and receiving.,3,Current Employee,Shipping and Receiving ,"Statesboro, GA",9/5/17,2017,9,5

I didn't like how slow they were at getting us change n bills and sometimes gave us late lunches.,4,Former Employee,Part time cashier ,"Tampa, FL",9/5/17,2017,9,5
Ongoing and evermore change,"Walmart is a great place to be in a supervisor role or lower management role if you are young or with a new family. The benefits are great but with the advent of superstores all stores went to a 24 hour a day, 364 days a year rotational schedule with overnight shift on its own rotation and it almost never changes if you are good in an area you get pigeonholed there until you get promoted, fired, or quit.

Good associates leave because of bad managers,"There is nothing typical about a work day at most Walmarts, Not all but most. Management not promoted based on merit or who is best for the job. Its about who is liked, who you brown nose too, and if you're willing to say yes to anything even if you know its wrong or is against your integrity. _x000D__x000D_If you're not willing to do all that and then and more you will be put in difficult situations, sent to stores you didn't apply for, set up for failure in hopes that you will quit.",1,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Greenfield, WI",9/4/17,2017,9,4

Counter productive. Not an enjoyable place to work.,"Walmart is a greedy company. They say they care and value their associates but its all a lie. They made a huge deal about how much money they were investing in increasing wages but then they cut everyone's hours drastically. People are rarely even scheduled 40 hours a week. They only give you a 10% discount that only works for junk food and some general merchandise. You get no discount on groceries. Quarterly bonuses are never given to associates.Most managers seem uneducated and inconsistent. One manager says to do one thing then another says to do something different. There always seems to be a lot of confusion on what needs to be done. There priorities always seem off. People are lazy. No one is ever capable of putting plastic into a bag or get a knew one when the bag is full, instead it just gets thrown on the floor. Very few people are trained to make a bale and don't care to learn. Getting promoted is never about your job performance or how qualified you are, its just about who you know. Raises aren't fair and aren't really based on job performance or work ethic either it just goes off how long you've been there. someones whose worked there for a few years and helps out all around the store, crossed trained in several departments, and cleans up after lazy people makes less than someone that's been there 10 years but is lazy, complains and cant ever get the job done by themselves.",1,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Deer Park, TX",9/4/17,2017,9,4

Productive work place,The pay was good at this job but having to work Thanksgiving when you have a family I believe is not fair.

You get discounts on almost everything and more during the holidays.,5,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Casper, WY",9/4/17,2017,9,4
its ok,This job had me jumping from ne department to another but it was crazy but was a good job paid well and the store manager is not very understanding and they do not accept doctors notes for sick days,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Enterprise, AL",9/4/17,2017,9,4
Stay clear.,I have worked for Walmart for 8 years. In the beginning it was a great place to work. Good pay with lots of perks and benefits. Slowly over the years all the perks have disappeared and the pay rate has slowed dramatically. I make the same per hour that a new hire would coming in and that's minimum wage. Only reason I stay with this company is because I'm getting older and work is hard to find. Definitely do not recommend employment with them.,1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"San Diego, CA",9/4/17,2017,9,4

Okay if you don't really have goals,"Walmart is actually an ok place to work for. Great benefits. But high turnover. Not much room for advancement and bad management. They bend rules for some associates but are ""by the book"" with others. No one really knows what ""policy"" is but yet it gets thrown around to justify certain actions. Just sloppy. Not a tight ship.",3,Former Employee,Auto Service Tech and Cashier ,"Roseville, CA",9/4/17,2017,9,4

Buddy system,Walmart is a good company to start off as a first time job or someone in college. They work around your school schedule but they are very orientated around it is not what you know but who you know in order to advance in the company. If you are not in the group of friends that the manager likes and don't even bother.,3,Former Employee,Dept Mgr/Cash Dept Associate/Sales Associate ,"Mobile, AL",9/4/17,2017,9,4
Too much stress with too little to show for it,"The culture of the Walmart I worked at was unpleasant to say the very least. Policy seemed to change on a daily basis and associates were often expected to complete tasks assigned to other shifts as well as their own. Unrealistic expectations and a constant loop of negative feedback were the norm. And the health insurance was garbage, so there's that too.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Knoxville, TN",9/4/17,2017,9,4
"very stressful, unless you are in the special group.","Start the day with having to zone your area because it was not done by the overnight crew.

Make sure you do all price changes.Work out of stock report, And make sure you have no test to take.Help customers when they need assistance. Reset department when it is time. The Management team well only a few have time for you. They seem to forget were they came from. The hardest part of the job was not getting the proper help when it was needed, Or the proper training. The most enjoyable part of the job was the family i did make at Wal-MART. In the beginning when I started with them in 1999 it was a wonderful place to work, Could not ask for better Management than what we had. But as I said Most  Management this day and time there forget were they came from, meaning no compassion or anything but I also believe that is because of who is in charge of Wal-Mart now.",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Pooler, GA",9/4/17,2017,9,4

its walmart,Walmart is an ok place to work depending on where you work and your managers.

Only a good temporary job,My manager has lied on me and lied to my face to save his own job. There is in no way I would work at that store again ever.

I was in charge of cleaning 5 bathrooms, 15+ trash cans, the employee break room, the back room, and everything else on my own for a part time job. I was being called over the loudspeaker ever 20 minutes. I was treated like trash. I was put on with a worker that refused to do ANYTHING.

Working over your scheduled hours is prohibited! The pay is good, but not worth it if you don't have hours. Management is awful. Never felt so unappreciated in my life. Quick to tell you when you've made a mistake but never praise for a job well done.

Good leadership is EVERYTHING!_x000D__x000D_Accounting changes were not given long enough to access the success of the programs implementation.  Accounting programs were dinosaurs, so it was required to use 2 to 4 or more systems to complete what could have been done more efficiently and cost effective.  Band aids of different accounting software were used to save money, instead of buying new programs when needed.  As a result, it became an impossible situation and cost more money in the long run than would have initially.  _x000D__x000D_I did enjoy the Home Office Culture, due to it's founders, it was more visible and integral in earlier years.  _x000D__x000D_I will always have a respect for the founders of the company and the impact they had on their community and the principles they lived by and built their company on.

"Poor workplace, lack of communication","My 5 years with the company has shown me that Walmart has no care at all for its associates.  They update policies only for the sole purpose of termination and after the termination has been completed they revert back to the old policies.  Also they do not follow their own policies, for example, I worked in the automotive section and it was policy that any technician that worked on cars cannot stock in grocery and my techs were still made to stock when under staffed.  They do not have any regard for your personal life when it comes to family emergencies.  They understaff and overload the working associates with other poeples' work with the expectation that the work be done by the end of your shift.  The communication from management to supervisors is EXTREMELY lacking, almost none at all.  I urge anyone looking for a job or even pursuing a career to stay far away from Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Auto care center service manager ,"Crystal Lake, IL",9/3/17,2017,9,3

A Soulless Experience,Every time an associate would clock in for his or her day a small piece of their soul would be stolen from them by the establishment.  Most associates were not equipped with the necessary tools to complete their tasks and projects. While Management were reluctant to understand the simplest machinations of the differing departments.  However most associates were willing to help each other where they could when they had the time.  The few times I enjoy working there is when my fellow employees and I were able to complete tasks together while staying within policy.,2,Current Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Arkadelphia, AR",9/3/17,2017,9,3

Wal-Mart is a very good company but unfair within the management and above.,Loved the company I enjoyed working there in my latest position. One thing about it is that some management treat associates unfairly and depending on your job title you might be underpaid. Ever since some new changes a lot of things I found upsetting specially for some one that gave the company 6 years. Unfortunately i found myself where they let me go without real specific information and even though I tried to fight they kept giving me excuses.

Walmat is ok but there is a lot of back stabbin in the store,I came to work there in the old store.  I had a different pharmacy manager. I loved it at first. Then we moved to the new store.  When my new manager came on she did not like me because I helped the older customers a lot.  Some knew me from CVS Pharmacy and would ask me to help them with their medications.  They wanted to find cheaper medicines because they had no insurance or little money.  Is that not customer service? I would help anyone who asked not only the elderly. If you did not suck up to her she made your life horrible. She is also rude to customers.  That's the way it is at Walmart.  There is to much back stabbing that goes on and it really hurts employees that are just trying to do their job and make a living.

I thought I couldn't go on , so I called my husband and explained to him that I have to quit because they were thinking of firing if I missed any of my shifts anymore.

Walmart is okay to work for.,Overall my experience of working at Walmart was okay.

Don't Do It Unless Your Desperate,"I have worked for Walmart for over a year, and it was great for about a month. Management covers there back more than helping you, and forget about getting tools to help you work. Every morning we fight for tools and no one cares about you. Benefits are so horrible, the only reason I have it is for tax time. Moving up is rare, but if you do move up you need no experience in what your doing. You might work the most and go over the top, but the person who talks all day long will get the management position before you do. I will say there are good days where customers and co-workers are all good but mostly bad days, bad weeks, and bad months. If you apply, good luck, but keep looking for a better job.",1,Current Employee,Online Grocery Deparment ,"Navarre, FL",8/30/17,2017,8,30

Literal example of corporate conglomerate take-over,"As a employee of 2 years, I have experienced the situation of ""bad investment"". During that time the location  went through 3 store managers and more than 5 department managers. The more honest employees are usually the first to get cut loose. Fowlerville MI is a location i personally would not recommend to anyone and for those who apply in the near future consider this a heads up. The auto care center was a nightmare and known for their lack of knowledge and customer service. After servicing in their auto care center for 2 years, it became very evident of the liability taking place. Its a dangerous environment and no accountability from your shop manager or department manager. other techs are careless and reckless as well as not showing any respect or concern for you ethics and safety.",1,Former Employee,auto care center technician ,"Fowlerville, MI",8/30/17,2017,8,30

It was face paced empoyees were expected to be consistent and professional,"A typical day at Wal-Mart to me was fun, exciting and enjoyable I loved my customers. I learned had to be a good customer service worker, be patient, professional, smile and learn as much as I could about the products in the Electronics Department. Management changed all the time and some were nice and some were not so nice and understanding to the employees needs. Workplace culture is what we the employees made it the Electronic Department was very diverse and we made the best of it in spite of our race, color and/or religious beliefs. The hardest part of my job was not knowing why an item was no longer available in the store, why the customer was so upset when an item wasn't available for them to purchase but was available on line, explaining to a customer what happened and calming them down. Speaking with a customer who didn't speak English I learned a little Spanish and was able to resolve the issues for most of my customers. The most enjoyable part of my job at Wal-Mart was seeing a customer happy about a product they had just purchased and was satisfied with my assistant",3,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate/Cashier ,"Tallahassee, FL",8/30/17,2017,8,30

abysmal work environment with lackluster co-workers,"Bottom line is that Wal-mart views every employee as replaceable and abuses competent workers. I was nine months pregnant working the Customer service desk and because of inadequate hiring policies was forced to run the entire area completely alone. When I had to call out sick for infrequent pregnancy related concerns, I was bullied and had my job threatened. I left the company after I gave birth to my son, and I have no regrets.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Murfreesboro, TN",8/30/17,2017,8,30
Fun place to work,I was an overnight Stocker at Walmart I enjoyed the hours. I worked in the domestic area every night. I also worked in the furniture area every night.

I would work there again if I could apply at my area Walmart.",2,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Lebanon, KY",8/30/17,2017,8,30
It is a job.,"At best this is a stepping stone job, management lied excessively about what was going to happen during and after remodel, especially about the amount of time you would be employed. Management at the store was very negative, discriminatory, and definitely not friendly for single working parents. This is not a family friendly job.",2,Former Employee,Temporary Remodel Associate ,"Longview, TX",8/30/17,2017,8,30
"Long, slow hours but a great place to start out.","Overall my experience at Walmart was average. Because I was part-time, I received no benefits, but I do know my full-time co-workers did. There is at least tuition help, vision, medical,  and paid vacation time as far as I know. It does take a while to earn vacation time, though. _x000D_   Management was fair sometimes, but wouldn't listen during others. At my Walmart in particular there were blame games because either people don't know how to hold themselves accountable or want somebody else to take responsibility for bad occurrences. _x000D_   It's a good place to start out, though; you're going to get used to excellent, good, bad, and just flat-out ugly customers so you'll have that under your belt. Usually they'll want you to work in different part of the store, so you can definitely gain cashier and grocery experience on top of whatever position you've been appointed to._x000D_   I'd recommend it as a place to be thrown into the working world, since you'll definitely be dealing with a diverse set of customers, but I wouldn't recommend it as a long-term, takes-excellent-care-of-its-employees place to be.",3,Former Employee,"Apparel, Jeweler, Cashier ","North Richland Hills, TX",8/30/17,2017,8,30

I did not like working here,"In all honesty, this is big-business, all they care about is the bottom line, not how the employee's are treated. The turn-over is high, morale is very low. Working in the front end, employee's of Walmart would pay for their groceries with WIC or foodstamps because working fulltime wouldn't pay them enough to afford food for their families. It's very sad.",1,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Howell, MI",8/30/17,2017,8,30
Would not recommend,A typical day for me consisted of being outside for 8 hours whether it's 100 degrees or a blizzard. Towards the end we were no longer allowed to keep water with us.

Frustrated former,"I was pretty happy working at my first location. I don't agree with everything about Walmart and how they operate, but I truly enjoyed the position I held. I transferred to a new location even though I could have commuted after I moved. The new location had different procedures and took time to adjust. Just as I was getting comfortable the manager above my VCM decided the new location needed to meet the budget better and decided my position was to be eliminated. (this was just 4 months after she approved my move to the new location) Upper management in my store assured me I would be able to be moved to another position with similar pay. However, they never informed HR and HR thought I should do all the work myself. I only really like the type of work in the Vision Center, so I left the company. I was a faithful employee, only missing 4 days in 2.5 years!",3,Former Employee,Vision Center Optician ,Nothern Indiana,8/30/17,2017,8,30

Challenging and Enjoyable,The people were fun to work with. The job is fast paced and interesting. You learn how to do several different jobs. You learn how to manage a team of employees. Their business training program was excellent. Opportunities for advancement and to some extent travel. Salaried based management often do not get compensated for working past 40 hours. The pay could be better for the amount of work you are expected to do. Better stock options could be offered to their employees.Wal-Mart was always cutting back on employee hours to save money often at the expense of customer service. Need to put more value in their employees.,4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"London, KY",8/30/17,2017,8,30

Poor Work Environment,Use too many techniques for tax write offs to save money. Conditions poor for customers and more so to employees. Management of employees is low especially at registers. Punishment for poor work is mentioned every so often in very long gaps allowing the poor work to be done for long periods of time. Cleaning and maintainance is left to workers with shorter hours most of the time unless the direct manager is there for the area you work in which is not often.

Good workplace with nice customers.,"Most days at Wal-Mart working as a cashier, you would usually get very nice customers but can be stressful because they usually buy a lot of items and can take a very long time. The longest transaction that I had to do nearly took one hour. I learned a lot of things about being a cashier and cart attendant but the management was very poor and bad because the managers couldn't control the staff and scheduling. The hardest part of being a cashier is dealing with impatient and harsh customers but the most enjoyable part is seeing the customers feeling satisfied and having a happy smile on their face. The hardest part of being a cart attendant is the weather and the most enjoyable part is the amount of free time you have outside and how quickly the time goes as you are working.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Cart Attendant ,"Brooklyn Park, MN",8/29/17,2017,8,29

Stressful,Walmart is a huge company that is doing everything in their powers to be bigger and better.  They try their hardest to take care of their associates but when they have so many there are going to be ones that fall through the cracks.  I had a great experience with Walmart starting back to my days as a part time cashier 10 years ago.  The new structure of the stores is making it harder and harder for management to manage.  There are less associates in the store each day and the ones that are there have set tasks that have to be completed.  There is little room for wiggle or for error and if you do miss a step its possible to fall way behind.  The work life balance as upper management is non existent.  All managers are scheduled 50 hours a week and our expected to work when needed.,3,Current Employee,Co Store Manager ,Ohio,8/29/17,2017,8,29

We have to organize where the overnight cashiers are placed. We have to make sure the customer service area is clean, and all return carts are done. Management is very hectic, but rewarding. The hardest part of the job is getting blamed for stuff that is out of the manager control. When customers are outraged, everyone who works for Walmart is the blame. But working at Walmart is enjoyable within itself.",5,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Hamilton, NJ",8/29/17,2017,8,29

Department Manager,"A typical day at work was always busy, there was always something to be done in my department.I previously managed and maintained a department up to Wal-Mart One-Best Way standards. The management wasn't always at it's best, I was one person managing my whole department 95% of the time, which caused some conflict around inventory, but somehow we managed to make it through. I would say the hardest part of the job was having to trash so much food every single day. I know it's part of the policy, I always just wished there was a simple way to donate to the needy. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely taking care of the customer.

Fryers, hot box, rotisserie ovens, and slicers to break down and clean with chemicals. The schedule was never set so hours varied.

Job pays competitively in accordance to other warehouses but with lack of proper management, expect to be receiving accountability for performances and breakdowns of equipment that is beyond your control.",2,Current Employee,RR Driver ,"Hope Mills, NC",8/26/17,2017,8,26

Okay to work if you just need a job,Walmart is a good place to start in the work force. I enjoyed working there. But there's not a lot of room to move up usually.

Always poorly staffed. Customers treat you disrespectfully and upper management in the stores seem to be oblivious to what is happening in the buildin,"This used to be a great company.

"Fast-Paced, Good Benefits, Little Advancement Opportunities, High Expectations, Low Pay","There is a nightly meeting that overnight associates attend where you learn your assigned area. After you are assigned in a department, you stock the freight on the sales floor or pull carts/pallets from the backroom to stock. You must zone and rotate your stock after you completed your freight unless otherwise instructed. Management is fairly laid back as long as you show effort and complete your assigned duties in a fair amount of time. The hardest part of the job is on heavier truck nights when staff is short and requires extra effort and sometimes a little too much is expected. There doesn't seem to be much room for advancement and they prefer you to stay in an area that you are proficient at. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is definitely customer service as it is rewarding to make customers happy.",4,Current Employee,Full-Time Overnight Frozen/Dairy Stocker ,"Waynesboro, VA",8/26/17,2017,8,26

job,"Walmart is a company that you go to thinking you will be leaving soon.  If you have a good work ethic, it can suck you in and keep you there.

walmart was difficult to work for by their problems with their recruting and giving people where they needed to be best put at.,i found coming from already service advisor training already with sears made it easier knowing how to help the customers with their vehicle services. I learned a lot and the hardest part was picking tires out of an un orderly system where tires were put at and learned how hard it was to get a promotion as to where people were positioned at within the company,3,Former Employee,Lube Technician ,"Chandler, AZ",8/26/17,2017,8,26
Lack of leadership but I thank my fellow techs daily.,"You have to be face paced, accurate, and FRIENDLY. Knowledge is power when it comes to your store floor and customer questions.

It's Wal-mart,"You'll get paid nothing (but that makes economic sense) Don't take this job if you have a family, this is meant for college students and kids in or about to leave high school.

Most stressful work environment ever,"Having very little work experience at the time, this was a first real job that I had. There was really no day management for maintenance, but there were two others that work that area they were really gunning to get that position. The other employees at that time were no better. There was one time were I was the only maintenance person on and there was a lot that needed to be done, the bathrooms needed to be cleaned and the cart returners needed help. Part of Maintenance job is to help return carts,while I was the only one on I could only do so much and I remember that they had to get two or three cashiers to go help return carts and one of them looked at me and said ""This is your job"".

Very poor treatment of cashiers,most managers are too demanding of each cashier and let their personal lives interfere with their everyday and take it out on the cashiers. Most customers are treated poorly and walmart does not help save money because there is no more price matching and coupons are very limited. This area needs more cheaper prices due to being a very poor neighborhood.,3,Former Employee,Casher ,"Ticonderoga, NY",8/26/17,2017,8,26

competitive,Good place to learn retail management and inventory control and flow processes. 70 % of stores and company management promotes form the the lowest positions of the company.

"Fast paced, but you're expendable","I worked at Walmart for 2 years and I can say in that time I didn't mind the job but the people you work areound are the worst part.

"Fast paced, long hours",Walmart is a good place to work overall. It is very long hours and you are on your feet all day. There is about 10-20% downtime on average but there is always things you can find to do during that time. There is room to move up in the company but you have to work the shift they give you and it can change at any given time. You may work the first shift for a few months and then the weekend night shift for the next few months. The associates stay in the shift they were hired for however. That's the downside to moving up.,3,Current Employee,Trainer ,"Bethlehem, PA",8/26/17,2017,8,26

I was in college at the time too, so i needed more money to help pay for school. The hardest part of working for walmart was when we got like 3 trucks that had came in during the day and we had to down stack them and make sure everything got to it's area and put away before 7AM when our shift ended.

Walmart was exllent,"the people were great to work with, I kept busy and time flew. it was a joy to go and I very much so miss it.  the bosses try to work with you and your schedule. They are like a family and try to be there for each other.  the customers are fun to work with. what ever your doing there you will be busy and you love this job.",5,Former Employee,"HBA,  stocker/ cashier. ","Latrobe, PA",8/25/17,2017,8,25
Management was unfair and employees were treated poorly,I would not recommend working for Wal-Mart at all. I felt like the managers were being promoted for the wrong reasons. The people that actually worked hard were being overlooked while those that did not work were promoted.,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Macon, GA",8/25/17,2017,8,25
Good retail experience if management is cooperative,"Working at Walmart is a good experience in working retail. It gives you a good idea of what to look out for and what is asked of you and in general can help advance your social skills when talking to customers or fellow employees. The issues I had involved communication with management and schedule flexibility. I feel like they could care less for their workers and what their workers need. It hadn't always been this way, but has slowly turned into this over time. Now I can hardly say the pay is worth it due to the hours I am getting and what is expected of me when I do have hours. It's ridiculous. However this is a problem with one store. Not the entire company as a whole.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Gadsden, AL",8/25/17,2017,8,25
Quick-paced work environment around customers,"If you like the challenge of working at a brisk pace, then you might want to look into working at Wal-Mart as a stocker.  If you are hired as a stocker, you will be responsible for helping to unload the truck when it comes in the afternoon.  The products must be organized onto different pallets.  Next, the pallets are wheeled away to be stored in the back.  Then, you get to load up your cart and take it out to ""the floor"" to put the product on the shelves.  You must keep up the pace.  Otherwise, you will put the next shift in a bind.",3,Former Employee,Stocking Team ,"Marion, IA",8/25/17,2017,8,25
fast pace,Walmart is a fast pace working environment. With great benefits but there are many downfalls for working for the company. management needs work on being more helpful and supportive.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Westfield, MA",8/25/17,2017,8,25

Stressful and Quick paced,Working at Walmart can be very stressful and the hours aren't consistent. The managers don't know what they're doing and to them you're just a number.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,Texas,8/25/17,2017,8,25
Productive place to work,"Its a good place to work, I have  been there for some years and its paid my bills. The hardest thing to me is that people come and go, like a good friend of mine she died suddenly last month and she worked in the deli. I learned that you must have a lot of patience dealing with people from all walks of life. The most enjoyable is that you meet different  people every day and some are so kind, they become regulars when then they get the same kindness in return.",4,Current Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Jacksonvilee, Fl",8/25/17,2017,8,25
Stressful,"Alway have people calling off so we would be given 4 times more work and be the only one doing everything, and at the same time having customers make you grab what they need and get angry when there isnt anything in the back that they needed. The management was very unprofessional and picked favorites to just sit and do nothing and expected too much",2,Former Employee,Produce Clerk ,"Carson, CA",8/25/17,2017,8,25

Was a prison,Managements favorite thing was to harass employees and wrongfully terminate them for things they weren't guilty of. Then would let people go without a word or reasoning.,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bellevue, NE",8/25/17,2017,8,25
Expects way too much out of a skeleton crew staff,"A typical day here is management telling you you have to get a whole list of time consuming tasks done, and they are ALL a priority. The company puts one person in charge of departments way too big, and gives them the minimum amount of employees and wonders why things aren't done in a timely or thorough manner. This company sets people up to fail, and they wonder why they have such a horrific turn over rate. What I learned is if you have a good work ethic and take pride in your hard work, you will be taken advantage of, and you will never feel like you're accomplishing anything. The company never provides enough equipment, so employees are constantly battling for resources. Even if you are lucky to work with decent people, the company itself and all it's ridiculous and delusional expectations creates an extremely negative atmosphere. And the pay is no where near where it needs to be to make working there worth it.",1,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Mechanicsburg, PA",8/25/17,2017,8,25
enjoyable and relaxing,"basically cleaning restrooms, emptying big trash and register trash, sweeping big floors and do what management and what CSM says, the most enjoyable part of working there was the other associates",4,Former Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"New Hartford, NY",8/25/17,2017,8,25

The job is decent. But managers are hardly around to help and you're left alone most of your shifts.,The break periods are very good but other than that it's pretty fast paced and you are alone most of the time. Managers aren't around often and 3rd shift is very hard to balance life with.,3,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Jackson, OH",8/25/17,2017,8,25

Decent workplace but too strict on employees.,Walmart managers need better training and better understanding of how much time it takes to stock an aisle. Breaks were good and long enough. Employees get discounts and full time employees get great benefits.,3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Bristow, OK",8/25/17,2017,8,25
"very convenient, warm environment",A typical day at Walmart was get dropped of and go to the back to put on my vest and ID. I would sign in and head outside to find my coworkers and we would push the carts back into the store.,5,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Palmyra, PA",8/25/17,2017,8,25
Working at Walmart has it good and bad,"During my time working at Walmart, I work with good people.  During a typical day at work, I know what to do each day but those things that come up which make it fun.  I have learned while working there that you may know what is needed to be done but you need to be ready for something to come up and figuring out a way to get it done. Because of this, I feel that I have gotten better at it. Now when it comes to management at Walmart.  They are good at what they do.  When it comes to the workplace culture to hard one but good.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with mad people at work.  Because you never know what is going to happen.  However, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-worker.",3,Current Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Fresno, CA",8/25/17,2017,8,25

Hard to change shifts.",5,Former Employee,Freight Identification Processor ,"Sutherland, VA",8/25/17,2017,8,25
"How much should we give? Only answer more, more, more.","Very busy, stressful place to work.  District managers care very little about the stresses put on the pharmacists, technicians, and cashiers.  Biggest stressors are rude, irate customers, constantly having to counsel patient on meds they have already been on, and phones constantly ringing.  Very easy to get distracted and make a mistake.  Planning a vacation was joke.  Made you plan vacation a year in advance.  Very inflexible in this regard.  Gave you plenty of days of vacation, but if people in other stores already asked for the week - you would not get vacation during that week.  Compensation ok.  Pharmacy manager good.  Initial training and program rollout lacking in communication, coordination, and efficacy leading to employee dissatisfaction with programs.  Healthfairs a waste of time and resources.  Stop treating Pharmacists as marketers.  If you want marketers, go hire some - you are the biggest company in the world! Stop discipling pharmacist for not giving enough vaccines!",2,Former Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,Anywhere,8/25/17,2017,8,25
Quick paced,A typical day was very quick paced and you had to be ready to work. I learned how to stay moving through a whole shift. Management wasn't very lenient but were organized. Everybody there is ready to work hard to hit production. Hardest part of the job was getting used to the long days and cold climate.,4,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Terrell, TX",8/25/17,2017,8,25
Not a great place to work,"Despite working fulltime for walmart, they do not offer benefits or enough pay to keep their employees from needing government assistance such as food stamps and medicaid.

A good place to work if you need a job that will allow you to advance in a fast pace in a changing environment.,Walmart sticks to their brand as being presented as a family oriented store.

I would recommend the company for someone either wanting something very short term, or very long term, Short term, they'll hire anyone for just about anything. Long term, there is really no shortage of different roles you can fill with the company.",3,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Oviedo, FL",8/25/17,2017,8,25

workplace,I would not recommend Walmart to any one that has a family or pregnant because Walmart and their management team do not care at all.

"A place to stay busy, but not enjoy it.","This place seems to have the most bizarre and backwards ways of handling things. New rules are in place nearly daily, though not discussed properly. They do not act on rules that would benefit the company and its customers by saving money so we can sell cheaper products but instead prioritize all customers, especially it seems those that have a tendency to steal and thieve.

I loved the people I worked with. No one took themselves too seriously, but we always managed to get all of our work done. Management was hit and miss; you had a few really amazing managers and a few not so amazing managers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. Overall I think it's a good starter job for someone in high school or college; or for people who really like to work in a retail environment.

walmart works you hard,Walmart is a great place to work with the benefits and incentives if you have an awesome management team.

Good place to work,Walmart is a good  place to work. I have been there for over 8 years. I do think they could do better with compensation. I feel like my opportunity for moving up is limited. They could also provide better training programs. They work you hard and sometimes with litttle help.  You have to be dedicated to stay there. They change some of our benefits.

"Pays decently, but not for what they ask of you","I first went into Walmart thinking that it could not possibly be as bad as it was, and for the most part I was correct. After a while however, management started to shift around and I was informed that this was a regular thing, as Corporate did not really like keeping some managers working the same places or shifts for too long. Shortly after, the Academy was established, and everything went downhill. The academy stressed the managers out, and they stressed the associates out. With everyone stressed, hardly anyone wanted to work and some of the managers would instead have their associates go above and beyond their normal duties to make up for an issue the academy presented. ""One Best Way"" also caused issues as some of the decisions would go against common sense and seemed anti-consumer, however it kept being hammered home that ""One Best Way"" must be followed.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Canton, OH",8/23/17,2017,8,23

Working for Walmart,My experience in working for Walmart has been positive for the most part. I started at a very small facility and was there for three years before I transferred just recently to a new facility in GA. My small starting facility provided good things but it also had bad ones. Being a small store we had that family feel about us. But also being a small store there wasn't very much in terms of promotions either. Same people holding the same positions for years and years. Work hours usually were anywhere between 8 to sometimes 12-13 hours. Work hours were determined by business needs and calls ins (when applicable). The management team was supportive and helpful for the most part. I felt like they geniunely would listen but they were very poor on following up and taking action when needed.

Walmart,Through my 6 months working as an employee as Walmart Supercenter I was a cashier/ Customer service manager.

Walmart is the type of company that doesn't allow to many absences for their employees no matter what the case is Walmart do not care at all. You can have a family emergency or a health problem they wont care.

My coworkers were not as capable of lifting things as I was, and a lot of my coworkers constantly complained on a regular bases about how insensitive and apathetic management can be.

Demanding job but worth the money.,Great place to work coming into the company. Felt welcomed and as a part of the team. Throughout time there has been favoritism and loss of some of our benefits such as sick time and holiday pay. Moved to a paid time off program which earns us approximately 1 hour pto time when working a holiday for straight pay. No double time or deferred holidays anymore. Other than that no complaints.,3,Current Employee,QA Associate ,"Terrell, TX",8/22/17,2017,8,22

Also, on the communication it is just not always there.  There has been many instances of associates not knowing what they need to be doing due to the lack of communication.  And sometimes it was given out too late.  Also, it's the type of communication that is lacking.

I would start work at 5am and leave sometimes 1:30 or2am in the morning and the=is would be everyday. By working so many hours at a time, I would take an hour and a half or 2 hour lunch.

Friendly associates, good hours and a very dynamic workplace. Daily routine consisted of cashier, aisle management, box loader/unloader, cart pusher, and various odd jobs. Working a job like this has increased my appreciation for the average retail worker. The hardest part was adjusting to the cash register, but come the third day of working there it was no problem.

not very good overall,"as a cart pusher, I would always be working outside in the florida heat. It was enjoyable being left to myself for most of the day; I would be able to kind of go at my own pace while still getting a lot of work done. However, it was very difficult to find the people from personnel whenever I was told to go see them or whenever I needed them. You could tell the company didn't really care for its employees much. Sure they'd have free food in the break room every now and then, but most of the time moral was very low and if you wanted to be switched to a different position it was very hard to do so. When the busy christmas season came around, my co workers would either call out or they didn't have enough of us employed at a certain time, leaving me alone to do most of the work. Then I got a coaching (3 and you get fired) because they didn't think I was productive enough. Keep in mind this is a whole walmart parking lot for just me to do--around christmas! I told them I had a leg injury and they didn't care. I asked to be switched and they said I wasn't valuable enough to the company yet. I was also often called into the building while I was busy to help customers wheel out and load heavy merchandise that I myself couldn't even lift.

My experience,A typical day at Wal-Mart starts off by trying to find equipment. This is a very important task because your job relies on it. You have to show up before your scheduled shift and track down people who may have equipment before it's given to another worker. After the equipment is maintained you must get on task as quickly as possible. Wal-Mart is extremely fast paced. You have to scan every out and ensure overstock is according to one best way. I worked in the deli and in grocery. _x000D_One thing I learned is Wal-Mart is very clicky. It's all about who you know and who they know.The best way to success is not to be the best or worst but in the middle._x000D_For the most part I was very pleased with management for the first year and a half. However there were policies in place for people who were in my past situation that should have been covered. When I discovered this I tried to receive direction. However management had me take a different route. Very disappointing. _x000D_The workplace culture is very clicky. People form groups. It's best to stay out of it. Best policy Wal-Mart has is the ten foot rule. Just smile and be friendly. Just keep it moving._x000D_The hardest part was how people would treat one another. _x000D_However the most enjoyable part was my actual work. I was almost bin-less and I loved how busy it was. I truly enjoyed helping the customers.,3,Former Employee,Grocery Manager ,"Lutz, FL",8/22/17,2017,8,22
Productive fun and learning experience,"There is no typical day at Walmart. Different focuses daily. Rather it be from market level, regional or from the food merchant.

Upper management seemed to not care about anyone.,"I was an assistant manager.  My biggest gripe wat this - the company cuts labor cost aggressively and the only goal in mind seems to be the dollar amount - even if there literally aren't enough people around to do the jobs.  But then as an assistant manager I was expected to enforce the completion of jobs and disciplinary action agianst associates for failing to get the work done.  I was also subject to disciplinary action for work left incomplete.  The motto among other assistant mangers was ""coach or be coached"" (coaching was a what Walmart called a getting written up).  So in other words, assistant mangers understood that they can either blame hourly associates for work not getting done and write them up, or they can expect for themselves to be written up for the work not getting done.  I wasn't willing to play that game.  So I left.",2,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Ozark, MO",8/22/17,2017,8,22

Strong company pushing to be progressive,Walmart has made great strides and continues to develop people. It creates a culture that allows its associates to own their part in the business.

However, if you are in the shipping department, you must be able to lift, whatever comes down the line. This can be anything from pillows, to massive 4 burner grills and 10,000 BTU A/C units. You are required to move an average of 5500 cases per shift. Note, this is an average. You will have lite days and you will have heavy days. They do compensate you well in pay and benefits.

Asked for more hours, but my manager could not give them to me, his boss was in charge, so regardless of hours promised, I was only working 3 days a week after starting out almost every day. I could not live off those hours. Co-workers were wonderful, my manager was awesome, but Walmart controls the hours and pay.

Recently the opportunity for growth seems to be decreasing due to outsourcing more than internal promotion. I really enjoyed my direct manager and they were good about setting goals for me and providing feedback often. The downfall of management in  my eyes were that they changed often and each bought a different outlook which called for some confusion, The workplace and co-workers were amazing it was always a pretty uplifting atmosphere that I was happy to be at on a day to day basis.

Management concerns.,"Wal-Mart is a large company that could treat employees with more respect. Unfortunately the organization is very hard to work for and due to changing schedules and lack of proper staffing, the organization constantly changes schedules and requires multiple days of mandatory overtime. This not only lowers team moral, but causes a large number of employees to quit due to job dissatisfaction. Last, but most important, managers are not very well trained and this causes managers to not listen to employee concerns and has actually caused employees to be scared to express issues or concerns. The most enjoyable parts of the job are when overtime is not required, that an employee knows when they will be working, the pay is very reasonable for the work, and the benefits offered are well above standards.",2,Current Employee,Break Pack Associate ,"Hopkinsville, KY",8/19/17,2017,8,19

Walmart overview,Arriving at work by 4 a.m. Actively moving for long periods of time and handling objects ranging from light to heavyI learned how to lift objects properly as well as to operate power equipment such as forklifts and barrets.  The hardest part about this job would be waking up very early. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to provide for my family and have the ability to move forward to a higher position.  This company had great management that was willing to train well and help as much as possible.,5,Former Employee,Walmart Distribution Center ,"Temple, TX",8/16/17,2017,8,16

productive,"a typical day at walmart was cashing checks,  paying bills, returning items and checking customers out with their goods. _x000D_some of the management team was supportive.

But the most enjoyable part was definitely closing and opening.",3,Former Employee,Lead Cashier ,"Jacksonville, FL",8/16/17,2017,8,16
Worst place ever,They don't care about the employees or the customers.  The top priority is how much they can make.  Equipment is faulty and old but won't be replaced since that effects management bonuses.  They work you through your breaks and lunches.  Tell you your not allowed to go home when your scheduled shift ends then make you cut hours of overtime during your lunch break.  I was terminated for a bs excuse after I had to contact the ethics department.,1,Former Employee,Cap team 2 ,"Graham, TX",8/16/17,2017,8,16

"Not a fun place to work, empty promises",The management is horrible you ask something they say they will take care of it for you and the never do and when you are in your department have freight or something your manager told you to do it most likely won't get done sometimes bevause they pull people from their department to go on register to help with the lines and when they do pull you it's either few minutes or the rest of your shift and then the associates get in trouble for their work not being complete and have time limits for department managers to get things done,1,Current Employee,Toy Associate ,"Carnegie, PA",8/16/17,2017,8,16
A good attitude makes a difference,"I enjoyed working at store 740. It's a smaller store than most of the Supercenters yet still has plenty of business. There were a lot of regular customers as well as many traveling through. The associates at 740  were like a family and helped each other out as much as possible. There was always plenty of work to do and staying busy helped me get through the day. The only things I didn't like about working there were being pulled away from working on one project to work on a different one, and that they sometimes expected too much from one person to do in a short amount of time. It made it harder to get everything finished for the day. Overall this is a good store and I would recommend it to anyone interested in working in retail.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Ozark, AL",8/16/17,2017,8,16
great place to work.,I was in charge of unloading merch from the pallets and loading them onto the conveyor to be labeled to where they would be shipped.

About what you'd expect from a Walmart,"I was at Walmart for a year, and for a while it was fine. Not good, not bad, just fine._x000D__x000D_Our department was fairly independent as our Department Manager was never present. So we were able to work without being treated like children and we worked well. Assistant Managers and higher were occasionally helpful, and the Customer Service Managers, who patrolled the store were usually very friendly and always able to help if needed._x000D__x000D_The work itself was tedious but it kept you busy and that's all you can really ask for when you're making just above minimum wage. _x000D__x000D_Unload your department's pallets from the back of a truck, which usually looked like it had used for filming the next Fast and Furious movie._x000D__x000D_Haul your pallet through the store and around customers while hoping it didn't fall or your poorly maintained jack didn't decide to give out on you._x000D__x000D_Unload it as quickly as possible and get your inventory marked, rotated, and stocked if need be._x000D__x000D_Mop up the backroom before clocking out for the night and go home._x000D__x000D_If you want to work somewhere where you can feel proud of yourself at the end of the day, Walmart is a great choice since most of your coworkers don't care about their job.

Review summary,"It's pretty steady, I learned multitasking really well. Management is poor, the csm doesn't know what she's doing.

walmart is not for their employees or customers they are for their money and product only,"management is horrible the cleanliness is horrible I have pictures to show they have bed bugs, roaches and rats that roam the store when their is a visit from corporate they hide everything in the empty trailers on the dock it is crazy associates get wrote up for going to lunch late even if it is from helping a customer they say they don't care. don't care about the health of associates. under pay use but want us to do your job plus management job",2,Current Employee,Warehouse Manager ,"Chicago, IL",8/16/17,2017,8,16
Lack of communication,"There is a lack of communication between everyone in the store. That comes with associates, and managers, as well as assistance. The store itself is great but the expectations for the day are not feasible. It comes with the fact that no one cares about what is going on in the day to day progress of anyones day.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager Toys ,"Red Oak, TX",8/16/17,2017,8,16
Great Culture,I enjoyed my time working in Walmart Technology. The work culture is amazing and everyone works together in a seamless fashion for such a big company.

At the store I worked with, I found everyone to be helpful and courteous, we all had strong work relationships and personal relationships as well._x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job was probably trying to lift things up to someone or down to someone if you were on a ladder.

Did not meet my expectations,"Typical day at work was answering main phones while simultaneously assisting customers with fitting room apparel.

I ended up quitting because I was going to quit in another month anyways to provide full time care for my newborn grandchild.",3,Former Employee,Fitting Room Associate/Switchboard ,"Joliet, IL",8/16/17,2017,8,16
Proceed with caution,"Walmart used to be a family friendly business. They have become far from that. They aren't concerned with the needs of employees especially if you are full time and have benefits. They have been getting rid of older employees, or those who have benefits all to save a dollar in my opinion. They promote often based on who you know. There are times when they get it right. They had been hiring part-time workers who don't care about their jobs. So customer service slacks and other employees are over worked. There is job security if you come to work on time and don't call in.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Customer Service ,"Huntsville, AL",8/16/17,2017,8,16
Walmart is exhausting,"Walmart starts out making you think its the greatest company in the world, and then you find out it's not what it's made out to be.

"WalMart Arroyo Grande, CA","Nice place to work, Nice people, Although I do not believe the compensation is fair for the job that is asked.

Very supportive place to work,"I can't speak for other departments, but in Health and Wellness (Pharmacy and Vision in our district) it is excellent. In my opinion it is the best employee environment in Pharmacy of the large retail chains. Although the computer system and workflow are not the most efficient, the focus in on the patient, service and accuracy. People are held accountable for negligence or attitude, but they understand errors happen and the focus is on improving practices to avoid future issues. They provide great support, pay is in the upper range of local competition, and they are very accommodating of personal and religious needs.",5,Current Employee,Pharmacist-Staff ,"Cleveland, OH",8/16/17,2017,8,16

Part-time,I didn't appreciate the fact that they hire part-time 90% of the time so they don't have to pay for healthcare and benefits. Its very difficult to live off a part-time and be making close to minimum wage.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Dixon, CA",8/16/17,2017,8,16

Depends on Department,"It all depends on what department you are in, but there is always drama in every department you work in. A typical day at work is filled with some kind of annoyance, depending on what extra stuff they are having you do for that day. But you get used to it and you do your job for the day and do it to the best of your abilities. I learned how to handle difficult customer interactions everyday and how to grow upon that. There are problems with every manager, but the management team has some, but not many, good managers. The managers that are good are some of the best managers I've seen. They listen and care about your concerns. The hardest part of the job is how stretched thin my department is and how many extra things management has us do every singe day and still expect us to get our job done.

Department Store Setting,"Low morale among employees. Management doesn't want to hear about problems with other employees not following procedures on main floor.

Productive but poor benefits besides a small discount on merchandise.,"I liked working at Wal-mart for the most part. It wasn't too bad. I was offered a full time position after less than a month. HOWEVER, I was I wasn't given a raise when I signed my full time employee paper. I was given a raise about 3 months later, but it was a nationwide raise for all basic Walmart  employees. _x000D_I was an inventory management specialist overnight. I binned in the overstock items and picked all items on the pick lists for each department to send to the floor for the stockers to put on the shelves. I enjoyed my job. I just didn't like how my schedule was. I would be on the schedule to work 8 or sometimes 9 days straight before an off day. I've only gotten one or two checks with overtime pay which was only one or 2 hours. Why? Wal-mart would scheduled me in the middle of a pay period, so that way my work days would cover 2 pay periods to prevent me from getting overtime pay. That way they could utilize my ability and work me over a week straight as needed._x000D_ I didn't like that at all as well as no sick time pay. I'd gotten really sick and was hospitalized for a few days before I could even make a year with them. I had all my hospital documentation and doctor's excuses, but they still took points every day that I was scheduled to work and did not show up, although I called in every time. By the time, I returned to work, I was nearly ""pointed out"" although I'd been in the hospital. I wouldn't recommend long term work for Walmart.

Suck,The work is easy but the management is pretty bad because its always changing. You have too many managers at which they all tell you to do something different while the other is asking you to do something else.,2,Former Employee,Frozen/Dairy Associate ,"Plainview, TX",8/14/17,2017,8,14
Could be great but falls flat,Walmart could be a great place to work for if it had better middle management and upper management. It seems to be that P&L is the one driving goal .  The optical division is mainly ran by pharmacist that I have no clue why understanding of the real workings of the industry. If they only just put people with a better optical backgrounds  in upper management and middle-management they could be making hand over fist. This would lead to the wife stress on employees and butter staffing.  As a manager you were drowned in paperwork that is repetitive and I needed and expected to perform without staff.  Their training for the optical department is very poor and leads to high turnover. The products as far as friends go to poor quality and I expected to be warranted as many times as needed in a year counting against the vision centers sales._x000D__x000D_ Walmart has remove many employee benefits over the last few years while increasing regular opticians paid they have not increased vision center managers pay to keep pace .,3,Current Employee,VCM ,Nebraska,8/14/17,2017,8,14

My review of Wollyworld,"Wal-mart is a monopoly that is on the constant run to take down every aspect of competition. They do not care about anyone's personal well-being; if you are not in the loop, you are out--and you'll know and feel it. If you are lucky enough to work under a good store manager and work with working-associates, it could be an enjoyable experience.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate; Lawn and Garden Dept ,"Somerdale, NJ 08083",8/14/17,2017,8,14

a very fast pace environment.,"a typical day at work was like any other typical retail, fast pace and you have to always be alert. I learner to have better patience and learned a more advanced customer service. Management was very hands on and alert. The culture was the best, getting to know new people was one of the perks. The hardest part about that job was learning new techniques to make it easier. I enjoyed meeting new customers and getting to know them in the customer service position.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Pomona, CA",8/14/17,2017,8,14

pay,"Lots of hours with very little pay, hard company to work for. You are hired for one job and end up doing most things in the store without the pay including management jobs.",3,Former Employee,Night Shift Lead ,"Springfield, TN",8/14/17,2017,8,14
Walmart was a good supported company that had many obligations and regulations that we as associates had to follow. Walmart was the best job.,Walmart was actually the best job experience i have ever had. I really enjoyed working there and making walmart improve in not only they remodel team but the whole store as well. I learned alot about mostly everything that needed steps to follow. They paid you fairly and treated every associate with respect.,5,Former Employee,Walmart Supercenter ,"North Miami Beach, FL",8/14/17,2017,8,14
