it was interesting place to work,"work day began around 11 pm, after clocking in, straight to the work floor to begin stocking the shelves with consumer merchandise.

Very easy job,"Walmart was my first job and it was somewhat of a roller coaster for me. I gained customer service and people skills, made lots of good friends, it was a nice, easy job. It was hard for me because at the time I was going to school full time, so I would be on my feet for 13-16 hours a day. The most enjoyable thing about working at Walmart was that it was convenient!",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tempe, AZ",8/21/14,2014,8,21
Good Costumers with an easy going working atmosphere.,A typical day at Wal-Mart is clocking in and finding your immediate supervisor. If no notes need to be completed there is a routine for each department. It lists the day to day activities that become your normal things to do every day. Eventhough the department I work in is lightly staffed right now we all get along well and do a good job. the hardest part of my job is when the upper management can not make up their minds about something and have you work on the same thing for more then one day. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the different customers that come thru the doors.,3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Baton Rouge, LA",8/21/14,2014,8,21

Rough career choice,"A typical day is we would start work at seven in the morning. I would gather that days schedules, workload, notes, recalls and objective from the store tour. I would then delegates the jobs that needed to be done to the merchandise supervisors. Then I would do schedules, hiring, evaluations and any other administration tasks that needed to be done. From this point I would follow up with my shift supervisors on the conclusion of the notes or tasks. I would then follow up with customer experiences and any other complaints that need to be address. From there we would have a 2 pm planning meeting. We would plan for the next day so the night shift would have a easy shift. From there I would spend the rest of the night following up today's notes, cleaning up the stores and handling customer complaints. Usually a managers day will end at 10 or 11 and night.",2,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"San Antonio, TX",8/20/14,2014,8,20
"Fun & Productive, yet unfair work enviornment","I realize not all Wal-Mart store are the same, b/c I started at one and transferred to another, with that said the 2nd was not so great. I enjoyed my job, but after a while I wanted to challenge myself and felt it was time to do something different w/in the company; my plan was not to stay a cashier forever. There was no room for growth. It was almost impossible to move up the corporate ladder, if you desired to learn more and had interest in learning other departments or become management. It felt as if they did not care to invest in your future for their company. Of course w/ any job you must start from the bottom and eventually work your way up, but for me it felt as though they would rather you stay stagnate. I felt that they were very unfair, unjust and discriminate in a lot of ways. Tonier and seniority meant nothing to them; for example,  After being there for 3 years, I asked to moved to a different department and got denied then later applied for a CSM position and was denied as well, but someone who was unqualified, younger and new to Wal-Mart got the position instead. FRUSTRATING... Had they allowed me to advance I probably would still be working there to this day.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service/Cashier ,"Hope, AR",8/20/14,2014,8,20

Friendly Associates,Working for Wal-Mart for the past 7 years have been very hard. I am over worked on a nightly bases and pushed to the limits. A typical day at work is down stacking freight and placing merchandise onto the shelves and also anything else that is asked. I have learned that there is no advancement with the store I work for and believe that we are underpaid for the work that we do. The co-workers would be the most enjoyable part of the job because they are all very nice to be around are considered to be more like family to me.

Friendly Co-workers with management that doesnt care for the employee.,"Every day is a push to check customers out as fast as possible, dealing with friendly and rude customers alike. You learn to multitask well through talking to the customer, ringing items up, and bagging them all while looking at the customer. Co-workers for the majority are friendly but most management will not show a concern for you unless you suck up to them first. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the rude customers while smiling at them the whole time and agreeing with them even though they are wrong. The most enjoyable part is the fun you have when you get a exceptionally nice customer come through your line and they make it a point to make your day.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Bremen, GA",8/15/14,2014,8,15

"stale and monotonous, but not necessarily bad","My experience with wal-mart is within the role of a mere part-time overnight stocker, though I've served the company in other capacities beyond my station. _x000D__x000D_To accurately capture the experience at wal-mart in it's entirety would be impossible having only worked at the one store in Anthem. I'm not so presumptuous as to judge the company as a whole based upon that experience nor provide other's with a means to do so themselves. There is also a great deal of turnover in retail at the store level, so you might imagine offering an accurate description of the environment throughout the course of my employment to be problematic.  _x000D__x000D_Am I happy with the job? While I may not 'hate' it, I certainly don't particularly enjoy it either. It isn't a bad part-time gig to have whilst pursuing my degree, but I would be remiss if I were to claim that I (or anyone I know) genuinely 'wanted' to devote their lives to wal-mart. _x000D__x000D_The pay is what you'd expect, slightly above minimum wage with the standard benefits of accessible health care, dental, with a package of services discounted for employees. (such as 10% off of most store merchandise, discounted mobile plans with family mobile, etc) which are rather nice, and on the overnight shift you earn an extra $1 an hour. So, as far as associate level retail pay goes; you could do worse. _x000D__x000D_There really isn't a difficult component to this job aside from simply enduring some moderate amounts of physical labor (which is about the equivalent of going to the gym for a light workout or jogging every morning.)_x000D__x000D_Honestly the only thing I've learned - more...",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Anthem, AZ",8/15/14,2014,8,15

Not a very nice company,After working for this company for 2 years I was fed up. The management is never on the same page and at one word from a customer your opinion doesn't matter.

stessful day to day functions,"having a nine to five job sounds great, but you never knew what you were walking into. you could plan your shifts out in advance, but most often you could never complete your tasks in a timely manner because your supervisors would pull you from your primary job functions to complete other tasks through out the store, but still expect you to have your work done by the end of the day. _x000D_Higher up management was always very stressed and it would tend to trickle down through the chain of command. As a supervisor yourself you would be in charge of training your departments associates yourself, which sounds great, but there was never enough time in a day to do this correctly, so most associates didn't get the type of training they deserved to be able to succeed themselves.

I would do all kinds of stuff from binning items to the steel to helping customers do carry outs which they have people to do that for. Management doesn't really help anything they just kind of laze around and tell you to do stuff that you're already doing. or they tell you to hurry up on stuff that should probably take a lot longer than anticipated. The co-workers were great, a bunch of people around my age with some of the same interests pretty great groups of people to work with.

"Productive, Family Oriented, Fun Workplace","My review working at Walmart was an exciting experience. We had managers who knew exactly what to say and do to make us feel loved.

Plentiful Opportinities,"Wal-Mart is a challenging company to work for. They demand a lot of time from you, so it leaves little time for work life balance. They do not offer any time of tuition program, so it is hard to stay committed to the organization upon graduation.

walmart,"The most enjoyable time spent at my previous job, as a whole, was the time I spent unloading trucks. I enjoy seeing the results of physical labor and the companionship that is acquired as a part of working with others with the same go getter mentality that I have. I also enjoy interacting with customers and being a part of the decisions in their day to day life. I learned to be a team player most of all, but also that if I work hard there is no goal I have been given that has not been attainable. The management team was fair and while they over saw the major points of our work I felt as if micromanagement down to the smallest details was not an issue, and our freedom to accomplish tasks as an individual was not hindered by the pressure of someone constantly standing over my shoulder. The hardest part of the job was also my favorite, and that was of course the physical laboring part. While extremely rewarding to be able to immediately see the results of hard work it can be extremely exhausting. Overall the time I spent working with customers and building strong work related friendships with my co-workers greatly surpassed my expectations of what a job can be if you strive for excellence",3,Former Employee,Inventory stocking associate ,"Milwaukee, WI",8/9/14,2014,8,9
Simple,"This wasn't a job per se -- more so volunteer work than an actual paying job. Still, I was putting forth my best efforts everyday. Usually, I'd come to the Boys & Girls Club after school and clean up the assigned areas. Duties consisted of cleaning and disinfecting the bathrooms, raking leaves and disposing of litter, taking out the trash, and keeping the premises as spotless as possible. Volunteering taught me that persevering and hard work can pay off greatly. It's all about applying oneself, regardless of the profession/job. The manager was also the senior director of the B&GC; open communication with each other was a must and he ensured that I took care of my responsibilities and often let me know if there was something that needed to be done. I was the sole person voluntarily cleaning so there were no co-workers involved. That also happened to be the most difficult part of the job -- not having anyone to assist me but I maintained to the best of my abilities. The most enjoyable part was being able to have working experience at an early age. It gave me a taste of what working in the real world was like.",5,Former Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Columbus, GA",8/9/14,2014,8,9

My days of working for the company,I typically had busy long days while working there but that was a good thing cause it kept me busy and made the time to go quickly. So far as the management team some were quite nice to work with but some I didn't like so far as backing me up on items that customers wanted to return and I would tell them that the item was non-returnable cause it was passed the time period for return. That would be the hardest thing about my job there.

not an enjoyable place to work,I worked there for 8 yrs starting as a cashier and moving my way up in the ranks to being in charge of several different departments and supervisors as well as associates. I learned to do price changes and Merchandise products to make better sales and profits. The management team in the store that i worked in was never all on the same page and directions were not clear from one manager to another. The hardest part of the job was having a store manager that knew abosolutely nothing about running a store nor was he able to make a decision for himself without having to check with lower management first.,1,Former Employee,Zone Merchandise Supervisor ,"Phoenix, AZ",8/8/14,2014,8,8

Productive  fun place where I can enjoy getting to know my customers as well as my co-workers,"A typical day at work would be working at a register, talking to customers about thier purchases, correcting customer purchase mistakes( which didn't happen all the time btw) and just basically making sure that the customer was satisfied with his/her overall service that I provided. I learned so much from working at Wal-Mart. In fact, my recently hired co-workers would ask me for help with all the produce codes and action codes that the managers would forget to mention. I also had met and became friends with alot of awsome people. The management was good, but I had a couple of managers that I was more comfortable and open with than some of the other managers. I loved alot of my co-workers, I looked at them like they were my second family. Most of my co-workers were really sweet and interesting. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry and picky customers. How I handled that part of my job was no matter how irritated I got I always treated them with the utmost  respect and I never let them get to me. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking with my co-workers and my managers and occasionally some funny and interesting customers.",5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Garland, TX",8/8/14,2014,8,8

Demanding unsafe place to work,"Wal-Mart may seem like a nice place to work on the outside, but when you have worked there for a year, you see otherwise.  When I first started there, they have you watch these videos about safety and customer service.  Well, within the first few weeks, I noticed that a lot of the policies weren't being met by upper management.  All they cared about is sales and how much profit they were getting.  They don't have the mindset of safety for their employees or customers. The only part I loved about the job was making the customers happy.  And yes I enjoyed making sure my department was neat and tidy.

Works as a family unit,"Management was amazing. They always tried to make it so that employees enjoyed their jobs and would always give incentives for meeting goals. Management also tried to make sure employees received praise for a job well done. This made working for them fun. Some co-workers were moody and just plain awful to work with, but the ones who were fun to work with made up for it. Most of my co-workers were much older than me and they all treated me like I was family. Management encouraged us to work as a unit and to treat each other as if we were family. One of the hardest parts for me was processing the bolts of fabric before putting them on the shelves. They often became heavy when I had to process three or four boxes filled with two to six bolts. The most enjoyable part of my job was listening to people talk about what they were going to make with the fabric, ribbon or beads. Fabrics and crafts was my favorite department in the store that I worked in. I also enjoyed being able to experience different parts of the store and different departments such as front end, back room, garden and seasonal, sporting goods, fitting room, electronics, apparel, and grocery.

Productive and hard working envirnonment.,"A typical day starts with a shift meeting where we go over the amount of incoming merchandise and how it is split up between store departments. My team and I then go get our handheld computers and i collect my keys, for the receiving bays, from management. We have an estimated arrival of each truck that i must pay attention to while pulling freight from the ware house and sending it to the stockers on the floor. When a truck arrives i take my computer and audit the incoming merchandise and compare it with expected values. If all things are clear we check the merchandise in and send them on their way, if not we make adjustments to the order and receiving sheets and have a manager sign them off. After the trucks are past my team and I back stock any overstock from the day merchandise shipment.

Walmart ok,"A typical day at work i would cashier and you'd have to stay at your register all day if no one is near a register to cover you. They would make u walk to an invisible line and ask people are they ready to check out. You have to scan items at a certain speed or they will complain to you about it in meetings but ,weeks earlier tell you it doesn't matter how fast u scan and bag items. The management didn't really do much to help out. I actually stopped going to my managers because 2 csms (customer service managers) had favoritism and things most cashiers did that weren't allowed they got away with but, little things like my hair or being 2 minutes late they would try and write me up. So when i would go to my managers they would try and talk me into working it out even though some things weren't fair. So i actually got fired because i told my supervisor i would call the EEOC because i felt harassed but they said i was excepting tips which was outrageous because every cashier would have been fired if that was the true case. Some of my peers were great people and i met a lot of people i'm actually friends with now. The hardest part of Walmart would be if you have to work overnight (i worked in a 24hr one) so it would be like 1 other cashier on register 16(the smoke counter) and the lines would get really long until the overnight people would come. Hours were good.

average work day at wal-mart,"A typical day at work for me would be coming in at 7am scanning what merchandise sold out, the night before. Based on that I order whats low and out. I merchandise my furniture to end-caps to try to improve sales on items whom sales rates are low. I've learn to better prioritize my time so I get all my work done before its time for me to get off. The management team for the most part are very good. You'll have some managers come and help you if you have questions, and the rest will just sit in the office and don't care if you're doing a good job or not. My co-workers are helpful, and don't mind helping you out on a project when you need it. The hardest part of my job, would be the lack associates we have in the store. I feel that if you have enough associates shelves should be empty and you won't have to over work your associates, so they won't be burnt out by the end of the work week.

I enjoyed all of the associates that I have supervised.  I worked well with management and was other duties that did not pertain to my initial job function.  The hardest part of my job was to sit in the termination of an associate but knowing that some of the issues for termination was at their control. It was also very difficult to provide customer service at the registers if we did not have enough associates but still needed to provide the same customer experience.

Productive Work Place,A typical day at work is high volume routines and tasks making sure that all jobs are complete and before leaving and shift changes make sure that work stations are cleaned and properly ready for the next employee to work in your area and that all merchandise is in its proper place.

Exercise and I felt like I did something,I pushed carts and helped people with whatever they needed. I learned to work independently when needed but also how to deal with a lot of different types of people. The managers were ok when they let people do their assigned jobs but often they had people do jobs they weren't qualified for and productivity was hindered because of it. The hardest part of the job was working with people who didn't want to work and let other people do the majority of the work. The most enjoyable part of my job was working outside and being able to work independently for the most part.,4,Current Employee,"Stockman, as a senior employee ","Greensburg, Pa",8/5/14,2014,8,5
Typical retail environment.,"A typical day at work for me goes like this; zone (tidy up) my department, scan my outs and lows (order product), complete tasks given by management, maintain accurate pricing, set mod's, stock department, and maintain an accurate inventory. The hardest part of my job is finding time to do everything that is expected of me. I often stay late to ensure that the job is done properly. The most enjoyable part of my job is on the days when I have everything done that management expects of me, I'm ahead of the game, and I can work on projects that are lower on the priority list but go a long way towards improving my department.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Windham, ME",8/5/14,2014,8,5

Great customers / Not so For management,Working  everyday allows you to build relationships with the consumers of the store. Each day or every week you have the same customers who you look forward to seeing and who look forwards to seeing you in that short time for providing great service . Management however is not organized  or in the best interest of there employees . I recommend that each manager takes an extensive course on how to operate a business and have sufficient customer service skills because there is a lack  of communication and respect from management to client.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Baton Rouge, LA",8/5/14,2014,8,5

I'v e been at walmart for two years now making the same pay, part time. I need a full time job that will support me and my six year old child.

The most enjoyable part of the job is having some sweet customers and workers.",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Dayton, OH",8/5/14,2014,8,5
Great company because of the name,"Wal-Mart may be the worse place to work. This is the biggest company on the planet but yet their workers start off at minimum wage.

A day at work through my eyes,"A typical day at walmart for me is, To come in at 3 p.m. to set up the backroom so my crew can unload the truck. When they arrive at 4 p.m. we start unloading the truck. By 6p.m. the truck should be finish, & I send the crew to break.

good work enviorement,"My typical work day involves me getting to the job start work and staying working to the day is done. I like to stay busy so the day flies bye. I like to learn new things everyday about my job to improve my experience for the company I work for. Management should be firm about the work to get it done, but yet fair to the workers.

spend alot of time being company oriented and not family oriented,"Expect to work a lot !!!!!! Always the bottom dollar!!! Assistants worked like dogs . Worked on days off . Came in to do scheduling on days off. New assistants hired off the streets with no retail experience were not trained properly . Suppose to be 4 on and 4 off but you will be lucky to get 1 day off. From the cashiers to the sales associates , O/N stockers they are the most amazing to work with. Dedicated and Hard working!! Hardest part was working with upper management . Nobody was on the same page .  The most enjoyable was working with the customers ! They were great ! You stay past your 8 hours of work,  should get OT and are forced to burn your OT on lunch or come in late. If you earn 8 hours of OT you will be told to take a 2 hour lunches all week . Which puts you an hour behind in your work. So then you have to work twice as hard to catch up from loosing time on lunch . Rarely ok'd for OT . Store Manager, Co-Managers, Assistant Managers have to keep hours and pay low to maximize  bonuses they receive yearly. So the average associate who works hard  and stays late making the company run - Receives little compensation for time spent working for Wal-Mart.  while the BIG DOGS receive anywhere from 30%  to 120% of their yearly salary on the backs of the associates they short hand ,work like dogs , and take the OT they rightfully earn!!",4,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Butte, MT",8/5/14,2014,8,5

hated it,"I don't know if it was because I was at a ghetto Walmart but it was horrible. Management had horrible attitudes. Example: I had a manager, when I worked in the front as a cashier, that would repeatedly get reported how she kept her job is beyond me. I transferred into the pharmacy and become a pharmacy cashier and it was the worst mistake EVER. The Walmart I worked for had pharmacy techs that would be on the store phone for 10-15 mins at a time while not doing work. No one wanted to help in the front and the customers was extremely rude and inconsiderate. They would see you working with someone else while trying to get you to find their medicine like you're some type of superhuman. My pharmacy managers were very nice and helpful. I would do cashiering duties and bag the medicine in the pharmacy. I was a cashier in the front at first but switched over to a pharmacy cashier. DO NOT do it! Your pay will be the same but you will have to deal with and do way more. It is very stressful, especially when you have lazy co-workers that would rather hide than help! Very poor experience and would not recommend.",2,Former Employee,pharmacy cashier ,"Montgomery, AL",8/4/14,2014,8,4

Can be a productive work environment on different days.,"A typical day starts at work that I usually end up working on a individual basis.  I have learned to manage people up to 150 individuals at one time.  Additionally, the management team working there can be good or bad depending on the individual.  My co-workers are usually great to work with.  The hardest part of the job is making sure things are done before the customer enters the store.  I would say the most enjoyable part of my job is working with the public.",2,Current Employee,customer service/stocker ,"Spanaway, WA",8/4/14,2014,8,4
Productive,A day at Wal-Mart is busy and different. I learned to be quick on my feet and positive even when they are rude to you. My co-workers were nice at times because of the customers and the management team they try to be humble but they act out at times. I think the hardest part of the day is stocking during rush hours and your not able to do your job because of the people. The easiest part is keeping the area maintained.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Chicago, IL",8/4/14,2014,8,4
Store Opening Temp Help,"I was part of a Temp crew that came in to help after the store in Albany, Oregon opened up. Over all it was a nice place to work. Very  nice to the temps.

You can make money here; but you might not want to stay long,"Wal-Mart is probably a great starter job and unless you plan on making it your career you might not want to stay so long that its hard to leave because your pay increases every year. Every day the job is the same its a very repetitive place nothing seems to change except the workload and amount of people there to help get it done. It seems that when people become Asst. Mgrs. they completely forget what hard work was when they had to do it but I guess it supposed to be that way. It seems that the wrong people are getting promoted as well, Wal-Mart does base the promotions on what a person has done, its really a who you know not what you know when it comes to getting promoted so good luck there. Also the pay is definitely not worth the headaches and body pain that received on a constant basis.",2,Current Employee,Overnight Support Manager/Backroom Supervisor ,"Richmond, VA",8/4/14,2014,8,4

Lacking management cooperation,"While my stay at Walmart was not very long, I had difficulty keeping up with directions from the different managers because they were all telling me to do something different. I was not kept in one position long enough to even get a grasp on how to perform my duties to the best of my ability. I started out as a stocker, then a back room associate and finally a janitor. This was the second time I have worked at this location but the previous experience was much better coordinated because I reported to one department manager who could keep track of my progress instead of the store manager, assistant manager and store supervisor who were all sending me in different directions.",3,Former Employee,"O/N Stocker, ICS, Maintainance ","Manassas, VA",8/3/14,2014,8,3

Unpleasant,"This is the type of company that does not care about it's employee's. The management treats their staff with the most disrespect that i have ever seen and I do not recommend anyone to work here. I must say that there are a few managers that actually care and try. But when you tell the company that you cannot travel to another store because of lack of money for gas or car issues they still force you to go, and then the compensation for the miles traveled to that store is not even enough the the trip its self. They also do not pay that well. I am a department manager and can not ever put food in my fridge.

Biggest Retailer on the Planet,"A typical day working at Wal-Mart meant assisting customers and keeping a well watered,neat and tidy garden department. I learned a great deal at Wal-Mart as a sales associate. Management was a little on the unorganized side as sometimes they would often forget to assist customers or move in a timely matter for cashiers to complete transactions in a timely matter.My co-workers were often cheerful and friendly and fit the Wal-Mart fashion of helping customers as well as co-workers alike. The hardest part of my job was trying to get other associates and assistant mgr's to go with any new plan for speedier work and trying to get someone to listen to your ideas unless you kissed a lot of bu**  It seemed to me most wanted to work in their own slow pace. I wanted to work fast and be productive during my hours on the clock.

Overall Learning Experience,"On any given day, I could be found stocking shelves or bringing low products to the front of the shelf for better visibility. I had some friends in nearby departments that we would help out whenever things got overwhelming. I learned that as long as you're nice to people, generally they will be nice in return, but there are several exceptions to that depending on personalities. Most of the managers usually stayed out of anyone's business and only acknowledged employees when there was a problem that needed attention. Although there were also some spectacular managers that went out of their way to make you feel comfortable and get the job done, there are always those managers that no one can tolerate. There were only a few at Walmart that I avoided, but only because they were very rude and made it obvious that they didn't care who they stepped on to get to the top. All in all, though, I must say that my coworkers and basically anyone else that I came in contact with while working at Walmart made me a better person and taught me many valuable lessons. The hardest part of the job was at the very end of my time there. I had just recently gotten pregnant and I was having a very hard time lifting and moving some of the stock. I wound up having to leave because of complications with my pregnancy. My absolute favorite part of the job was the people I worked with and the people I met.

My review On Wal - Mart,"i loved working for Wal-Mart it was the greatest experience for me, they have amazing benefits and great employees to be around throughout the day. i would recommend this job to anyone i know. my typical day at work was great, i got along with my coworkers we built a family relationship. and i would really love to go back and work for this amazing company. i learned how to manage money, i learned how to use hazard safety rules, i learned how to serve customers in the most proper way, and to go over their expectations. the hardest part of the job is when it gets busy during the holidays, because you really have to pick up the pace and make sure everything stays in order, and sometimes it gets tough, but i love a challenge. the most enjoyable part of the job is working and communicating with the customers, hearing about what they love about Wal-Mart",5,Former Employee,Hiring Manager-Michael Folkner ,"Phoenix, AZ",7/31/14,2014,7,31
Learning to stock freight on my own,"Come into work at 10pm 5 days a week start my shift by checking my myguide task then going outside and grabbing 4-7 baskets to break down my work in the aisles i would be doing the work in go grab gemini hand scanner then go see how many pallets i would have to do that night usually 5 to 7 pallets of work. I would try to finish at least 1 and half pallets before our first break which was at 12am.

Learned a lot and enjoyed working there.,"As a shift manager I was responsible for the night operations of the store, ensuring that the departments were staffed accordingly to the amount of freight processed. I made sure the trucks were checked into the inventory system and that they were unloaded and staged correctly. After that, I made sure the merchandise was sent to the sales-floor and stocked to its full capacity, double checking the stocker's overstock to make sure it was true overstock. I then  ensured that the overstock was processed into the warehouse by bin location and SKU. During my tenure with Wal-Mart I learned many useful management skills and knowledge that has helped me pass all my recent management courses with A's. I learned vital organizational behavior which helped me succeed with accomplishing the companies SOP's. The hardest part of my career was working grave yards and not having the balance between work and family. The most enjoyable part of my job was teaching and training of my associates and their many personalities, that made my job fun.",5,Former Employee,Shift Manager ,"Las Cruces, NM",7/31/14,2014,7,31

Experience at Current Company,A typical work day is challenging but I welcome a challenge. While at this company I learned value of hard work as well as team work. The management I have gained a great deal of knowledge. My co workers were a joy to work with.

Then I let my departmental manager know that I'm here. I greet customers and everybody with a smile. I cant help my smile it comes naturally. I always put my best foot forward when working with people  and co workers because I never know what I can help someone with; from emotional to physical. The most important part of my job is when the customer is satisfied. The hardest part of my job is when I cant do anything to satisfy the customer, then and only then I have not other choice but to involve management.

The customers do not have anything to do with your personal life.",2,Current Employee,Service Writer ,south carolina,7/31/14,2014,7,31

Very productive place with lots to do and plenty of customers,"A typical day working at Wal-Mart meant assisting customers, very fast paced and often busy. I learned a great deal at Wal-mart as far as cashier functions and state rules and regulations as far as the sale of alcohol,guns and tobacco. Management was a little on the unorganized side they would often forget to assist customers or move in a timely matter for cashiers to complete transactions in a timely matter hindering time. My co-workers were often cheerful and friendly and fit the Wal-Mart fashion of helping guest's as well as co-workers alike. The hardest part of my job was maintaining a speed to complete transaction which was not very hard unless a customer's card wasnt working properly or if they misplaced their means of payment halting the transaction.

Sales Associate,"I had worked for Wal-Mart on a part-time basis from September 2007 to April 2008 in the electronics, Connections, and photo lab departments.  The pay was better than I anticipated, considering what I have always heard about Wal-Mart.  However, the overall culture of the company is as bad as people say, and maybe worse._x000D__x000D_Store level management do not have any real skills in actually managing people.  Two cases in point:  Over Christmas I was approached by my department manager who asked me that since I was Jewish, would I mind working Christmas Eve (I was at a loss for words).  The second example is a lecture that I had received from an assistant manager who was very adamant about the fact that I had no integrity.  this was the result of me servicing customers (and selling product) when I was alone in the department, as opposed to breaking down boxes in the back room.  Of course, a look at my resume would probably indicate a higher level of integrity than this manager had._x000D__x000D_On the store level, employees are generally considered expendable and often not treated with respect (unless you fit in a particular manager's clique).  Most of the other sales associates are decent folks trying to make a living, but they are often treated horribly by store management and many customers._x000D__x000D_Though I made more than I had expected ($9.75/hr when I left), I ultimately decided that this job, which I was working to supplement my monthly stipend, just wasn't worth the hassle.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Milford, OH",7/31/14,2014,7,31

Good place to work while going to school,My time at Wal-Mart was anything but typical.  I worked a night shift and supervised a crew of 15-20 people.  Each night a truck was unloaded and the merchandise checked in and taken to the floor to be put on the shelves.  My co-workers were hard working people who took pride in their jobs.

Great job to start your work career,"A typical day at Walmart for me is very hectic. I come into pallets and more pallets of freight to work and all of it is expected to be completed by the end of the day. Being that I'm the ONLY associate in my area that's kind of a ridiculous expectation but I still manage do my best and I do complete most of the work to their satisfaction. On as to what i learned, would be my favorite perk of the job. I've learned a lot from work ethic, how to approach a customer in the correct manner, the handheld devices use to locate items throughout the store, the forklift and pallet jacks in the backroom and etc. My co-workers are just like me, looking to gain knowledge from a huge company and use that to our advantage in the ""job world"". We always talk about our job tasks and the customers and how we ""slave"" for management but its a friendly environment to be fair. The hardest part of my job is having multiple tasks by multiple managers and supervisors and being expected to complete all in a few hours time. Somethings got to give, I wish there was more communication. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping a customer and making their day better.

Very Busy,Busy Always On Call. Etc Too Much Work Poor Management. Wal-Mart is the worst company to work for. In order to get promoted you have to be screwing management or hang out with management outside of work. I think Wal-Mart is a joke they always say they hire from within they like to promote from within but I have seen on numerous occasions they have brought outside people in as management and expect the people who has been doing the job to train them. REALLY... why would I wanna train my boss.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Houston, TX",7/30/14,2014,7,30

Horrible place to work. No employee coverage ever! Management is soo rude! Family is definately not their moto!,"I have been employed with Wal-Mart for three years, Worst Company! All the managers care about are who they can get in trouble and the pay checks they get to collect. There is never any employee coverage! They tell you that you will be allowed to be empowered, handle most of the majority problems with customers on your own. But as soon as you do, what ever you have told the customer is always wrong and you end up in trouble over it, usually in front of the customer. All I can really say positive about working there is the associate that you work with daily become a huge family. The worst part is the degrading in front of customers and constant flack about stuff that you had nothing to do with, but since management got in trouble over something they feel the need to go chain of command and yell at you for something you may not of even been there for. Worst place ever to work!",1,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,Benton IL,7/30/14,2014,7,30

"Repetitive and dull work environment, with low morale.","A typical day starts with our routines of scanning to fill the shelves, taking care of any left over freight from the night, receiving to-do lists from our managers, and taking care of customers throughout the day. On an average basis, our management is inconsistent of what to expect from them, can be very hard to work with or for, and can be negligent on caring when it comes to personal matters. Co-workers are great and can make the day go by so much better and quicker, especially when having a bad day. Hardest part of the job is dealing with upper management, whether if its being given daily to-dos, or having an issue, be it personal or business related.

I learned how to adjust to every customer I encountered on a day to day basis by the energy they produce. The management wasn't so good on discipline and more so the training process, as I said before the system provided was my trainer. There was no hard part to the job everything about it was something to enjoy as far as seeing how many credit cards you could up sale to making sure every customer leaves you with a smile.

Information about my experience working for Wal-mart,"My typical day at work consists of checking out prescriptions for customers and handling payment of them at the pickup window. I previously had no experience in Pharmacy operations, but I learned a lot about the process required to expedite pickup, drop off, process insurance, and filling prescriptions. Some of those things I was not allowed to do as a cashier, but I still was eager to learn by watching. My job was to maintain stock and process pickups. Management was supportive and open to suggestions to promote a team effort so that efficiency would improve daily. My co-workers were very good at what they do and as a result, I was able to learn new methods to apply to my own work to improve. The hardest part of the job is expecting that some changes in the pharmacy procedures of certain duties could change daily, requiring adaptability on a daily basis if necessary.

Making sure the customer has products on the sales floor to choose from as much as possible.  I have learned that this is a daily struggle to make sure customers have products on the sales floor that they are looking for.  Management I feel is very lacking in this workplace.  What I mean by that is there is a major lack of communication in direction of employees by which an employee with have multiple members of management branches giving them different tasks to complete while they are trying to already complete a task.  Co-workers seem to be grouped  in which they stay to their group rather then working as a whole.

Often, they send only one cart pusher out there for an entire shift, with no assistance until the carts fall severely behind, which, due to the low number of staff members, happens often.

The hardest part of my job was trying to keep what I was doing correct ans to Walmart's standards but yet it still wasn't good enough when it came down to it. i really liked working for Walmart because the hours was great that I had because I could make all my sons football games and able to take him to school because I don't trust him ridding the bus so I could spend that extra 5 mintutes with him.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Amite, LA",7/24/14,2014,7,24

I loved the people I worked with and the shift that I worked,I was the firs over night shocker in the toy department. started at $8.75 a hour and there was no training really.  I think I worked there for about 2 weeks before someone came over and helped me to learn what to do.  By that time the department manager came to the overnight shift to train me.  By my first year I was at $10.00 an hour because I became a weekend worrier which meant I worked 4  days including all weekend day from 8pm to 7am and had 3 days off during the week.  when Wal-Mart got ride of the shift I kept  my pay and moved to the front as a cashier which I loved because I had much more interaction with the customers.  In time i would help train new cashiers and help the front end managers when they went on vacation.  I was asked to be a front end manager but I didn't think I could do the job the way I thought it should be done so I turned it down.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Beloit, WI",7/23/14,2014,7,23

Walmart is one of the most largest comanies in the retail industry.,"Initially I statred working for Walmart as a shoe associate. A typical day was receiving, stocking, and assisting customers, then I moved to the visionc center shortly an became a vision associate.

Great place to work,A typical day at work for me includes processing the returns and all claims from the evening prior as well as the current day. Working here has taught me a lot about how the cycle goes in running a business and how things need to go to make it successful. If everyone works the layout as the system states then business will run properly. Management plays a big role in carrying out the daily tasks of dealing with customer issues as well as employee issues. As long as the customer is happy and the employee has a good environment to work in all is well. I feel my co-workers play one of the biggest roles in the success of Wal-mart.Customer service is key and is mandatory. The hardest part of my job would be making sure that all of the claims for the day have been processed correctly so that the store gets all the credit it deserves and the most enjoyable part of my job would be reviewing the monthly journal and seeing that my store received the less possible charge backs and therefore the most possible credit for the month. That makes it all worth it.,4,Current Employee,Customer Ser./Money Ctr/Claims Asst/Phone Oper. ,"Atlanta, Ga.",7/22/14,2014,7,22
A normal job environment,"A typical day of work for me is stocking freight in the morning before automotive center opens. Greet and assist customers. I have learned to have a lot of patience and treat others the way you want to be treated respectfully. Management agrees with the policy but then again they don't considering that the employees follow the policy given to them and management sometimes turns around and gives it to the customers. No support for employees sometimes. The hardest part of the job is working and not getting appreciated for all the hard work you put into the job.

Retail is demanding - it is (like most everything) what you make of it.,"There are high expectations in retail with high volumes of sales.  There is always more work to do that physically possible in a days work.  _x000D_  Each day consists of taking the merchandise from the pallet to the store shelves, putting the merchandise in the correct places.  Each day is unlike any other in ways - same concept - but you never know what customers are going to do or need help with.  _x000D_  Our current managers don't come around to say much to me - I may be blessed to see them once and to be asked how things are going. Previous managers would take time to teach me new things which I really enjoyed but an not able to use the information much anymore._x000D_  The co-workers come and go- there is always a turn over.  There are only 5 of us that started together when the store was first opened.  There are some team players and those who come in to just do their thing and that is it. _x000D_  The hardest part of the job for me is working 3rd shift, and walking on the concrete floor.  Demanding customers can also be a challenge._x000D_  I enjoy seeing how I can go in and make the department I am working in look better by the time I leave.

The hardest part of this job is having employees arrested for theft and conducting the internal investigation. But at the end of my day I have a job to do and I will not and can not let relationships I have built interfere with my job is something I have learned as well.

Company fails to meet many boasts,"It is my personal experience that working for Wal-Mart can be a less than satisfying experience, especially after the various boasts made during the application and training process. _x000D_ _x000D_A typical day at work can vary but typically not in a good way. As the day begins associates are expected to take returned merchandise and place it back on the sales floor and to straighten and organize our sectors. Most associates however see this as an opportunity to chit chat before business picks up resulting in carts of merchandise littering the aisles throughout the store and unorganized shelves which causes a variety of issues such as pricing confusion or simply not being able to find the desired product. Overall, a very inconvenient shopping experience for our customers. Throughout the course of the day we are to keep the area clean and provide excellent service in any and every way we are able. This proves to be difficult however for the simple fact that we are constantly pulled from our area to work in other departments where associates trained in that area refuse to work or associates were simply never hired because it wasn't deemed important enough to staff. At the end of the shift we are to organize our zone one final time and ensure everything is taken care of to the best of our abilities. This is the time when many associates sneak away for the last hour or two of their shift because there is little management present, resulting in an increasingly heavy but easily avoidable workload everyday. _x000D_I've learned quite a bit from my job, such as working on vehicles,running cash registers, - more...",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Newark, OH",7/21/14,2014,7,21
A typical day at Wal-Mart,"When I first began working for this store in 2008, I loved the environment. This store slowly became one that was full of managers who picked their favorites. Their favorites would never get in trouble and the non-favorites would get in trouble for things that they knew the favorites were doing. For example, I was let go May 29, 2014 for tardies, not absences, but tardies when I know for a fact that there are associates that have numerous absences but they are never called into the office.

Very hard place to work. very professional.,"Typical day was coming into work having a meeting with the supervisor of the night, he or she would then explain to us if anything new has happened or something has happened, he or she would them assign us or aisle to go and stock and we would get to work then get a break and then come back and finish or clean up our trash and go back to the backroom and prepare to start binning which is taking inventory of the backstock from every aisle and making sure it is placed in bins and organized and the numbers on the inventory label are correct. I learned a lot this was my first job I built character, some leadership, I learned what it was like to have a job and what it took to do it day in and day out. The managers there are amazing very dedicated, very caring, always there to answer questions and lend a hand. The hardest part was when I was given a lot of task at one time and I was alone with no help and all I could do was do the best I could.

So I also didnt get the time off with my family that I was told I would. Second, each order is timed, another thing I wasnt told at my interview. I can do the work but because of a.s. I cannot do it at a breakneck pace. Third, training was a joke and outdated for forklifts. I would see forklift drivers driving with forks 18-24 inches off the ground at times. Lastly, safe practices were nearly non-existing.  A fruit dropped on a guys head from top racking (about 20+ feet) no big deal, a container of ice cream fell and knocked a girl out, hospitalized,  and they still have an ""accident free"" workplace?

We learned how to process checks and other forms of payment and how to do different transactions on the register. Management was nice.

The most thing about working at Wal-Mart that I enjoy is the co-workers and also the fact that I work on the frontend and I know all the areas that involve the frontend such as customer service and money center.

Overall the company is a good company to work for.,"My typical day at work was taking care of customers and ringing up items to be purchased, keep my area clean, and help where needed.  I learned how to be nice to people even when they are mean to you; not to say anything mean to the customer but show them respect; and main lesson I learned was that if you are pleasant and smiling at the customers, they will return your smile.  Sometimes your smile will make their day that much better.  I found that I had to be a good listener also.  My co-workers were great to work with.  We all tried to help each other whenever we were without a customer.  We worked as a team.  My management for the most part were good.  As I have worked in several stores, I found that management has different methods in how they run a store and/or department.  I realize that they have lots to do even if it seems they don't.  I would not want to deal with what they have to deal with day in and day out.  The hardest part of the job I found was that I had to keep my mouth shut and not say something back to those who were disrespectful.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.

Shut out of great job due to prejudicial treatment by new management.,"Always busy and more work than you can imagine. Loved being busy and working hard, loved waiting on customers and the excellent reviews and evaluations I received. Was able to train and grow employees and prepare them for management. Was important to me to continue as an hourly employee, who worked M-F 7-4, every weekend and evening spent with my family. ordered, grew and maintained a department from less than one million in sales to over eight million, and took great pride in my work and appearance of my department. supervised an average of 12 employees at any given time and learned to delegate and train with great results. The favoritism and lack of fair work practices at our store, under new management resulted in intense pressure on me, not by them, but by myself. I had worked with the company for 29 years and knew what it's beliefs and goals were. New manager tried to force people like me into salaried positions, working nights and weekends, and never allowing enough time to keep my area up. Help was given to people who didn't work and help was taken away from those few of us left, who actually worked hard and did an excellent job. An ex security guard was given a co-manager position and had no idea what he was doing. When questioned, he complained and when I got permission from one co- manager to come in early and set a movie release modular, he tried to get me to straighten the grocery, and when I challenged him, he became belligerent. I told him I would go home and come back at 7 for my regular shift, he said I was walking off the job.

I learned that it is not always easy to keep a smile on and be kind but it is very possible if you try. The hardest part about about working here was having to stand in one place for extended periods of time. It was doable just uncomfortable. Though standing wasn't always my favorite thing it did help me decide to get into better shape and be used to being on my feet a lot more. I loved going to work because it was just a fun place to be.

Front end registers must always be kept ""up to plan"" but those in charge of scheduling people for the front end never scheduled enough associates to cover that plan even without any call outs.

Great Distribution Center,"I got there and wanted to prove myself. I did I broke records as a Transportation Router, and figured out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Its not an easy job to take on but worth the benefits. You always have interaction with the public whether it be that driver, the receiving associate, or sometime a customer that just wants to vent about having bad service. Thing is I learned to listen and inform, I still had to deal with people who wanted to talk over me or out talk me but that didn't bother me, I was good at my job and no one except me could take that away. It was stressful work and many times I wondered why I had been hired, alot of associates told me I was gonna either quit or be fired in six months. I quit before moving to New York with my husband and daughter, the next DC was too far away from where we were moving so I couldn't transfer, but I'm glad I did that job well, last time I talked to some of my old co workers they told me that it takes two people to do my old job now.

The store where I worked at was very labor intensive with limited employees. The hardest part of the job was asking for help with store management team on a task that did not provide any prior training and getting no response. As a result I learned to work independently. On the bright side, I had a fulfilling experience working with my co-workers and helping different customers. I acquired interpersonal skills by interacting with people all day.

The pay raises between levels of difficulty were minimal as well, only 20 cents/hour to do much more work. As a result, most employees refused to do the harder jobs because it was not worth that small increase in pay.

Walmart associates become family!,"Being in management was extremely stressful and tough. Long hours with taking a lot of days off away. You start each morning with notes and have to execute them by 4pm. No excuses. Notes get added on to you throughout the day as well.

Just Too Much Drama,"Typical, clock in get on register that your assigned to, wait for till, clean your area, zone, clock out for lunch, clock back in, go to different register with a different till. Listen to managers complain about their job, or the male managers flirt with you and the 30 other female cashiers you work with. Here all the drama about people sleeping with multiple people. I would have really enjoyed it if there wasn't high school drama. Plus I had gotten severely sick, called in and talked to a manager. Had two days off to recover,was told if i didn't come back, I shouldn't at all. Well family drama occurred and I ended up moving and I tried calling, several, several times to no avail.

This job offers little room for growth or personal satisfaction.,"In my opinion Wal-Mart lacks an over all goal for their employees and managers. Best way to describe it is that ""it"" runs down hill and for those of us ""down"" in an hourly position, it piles on. We are presented with unrealistic expectations regarding time frames to complete assignments because of outside hiring of management; instead of from hiring from within. Other than getting through the shift there is no goal set for our team, the job lacks self satisfaction because of this. This also presents the biggest problem, for me, with the job; because there's no pride you can take away from what you've done after any shift. The most enjoyable part of the job would be that your co-workers feel the same as you, so you're not alone in feeling stuck.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Dairy Stocker ,"Westminster, CO",7/14/14,2014,7,14

Fast-paced and stressful in an unappreciated atmosphere.,"It is almost like working for fast food except that it is retail. As a cashier you work in a fast-paced, repetitive environment where days are pretty much starting to blend real fast. Not much actually changes around the store except the prices and when they do change the cashiers seem to not know about it till last minute. Some of their rules for customers should be more stricter and actually have some decent security around to prevent the loss of money. They leave it all up to people who are barely trained as it is to catch shoplifters. So if you do not mind working in this type of environment then I say go ahead. It is a good experience to as least have for future reference.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Omaha, NE",7/11/14,2014,7,11

My typical day when I come to work is getting told where I am going to work in which department or if I actually going to do my job as changing the modular for that department. Wal-mart has changed so many management and they get down on their associates a lot. They sometimes have grudges to certain people if they do not like them and find reasons to fire people. The hardest part of working for them is that they do not communicate with each other and it gets hard for the associates because they have to go to each manager to get the correct answer.

When I told her there was nothing I could do but call a manager she threw said vacuum over my counter. So you can get some people that are just irate.

Stressful overworked environment,"Walmart's slogan is ""Save Money Live Better"", when in fact as an associate you are virtually unable to save money and live better due to the horrible wages they provide. Being the largest retail company in the world you would honestly think they would want to take care of the associates who make it all happen. Over working their team members is an understatement. Management. What management? Most if not all salary management, pawns off all the delegated notes from the store manager to all department managers. Over working the staff creates horrible customer service due to high stress and pressure to push out all the freight from the back room. Thus, the associate will walk right by a customer without asking if they might need assistance finding a certain product.

I was lucky to work with such a great team that would come together under pressure and always provided the best customer service including going above and beyond to provide assistance.

I was given the opportunity to learn about fixed base operator functions as well as corporate and private aviation.

Walmart,"For associates working  8 hours get 2 paid 15min. breaks and 1 hour unpaid lunch. You get holiday pay, but it depends on how many hours you work a week. For example you work 40 hours a week you get 8 hours holiday but if you work less then 8 hours you get less holiday pay. Most enjoyable is helping customers. Hardest part is getting the right people in your department. (as a supervisor) Management, well you have some really good managers and then you have some that aren't as knowledgeable.

If you can find a good equal management team within the company stick with them.,I really enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart for the most part. There was always something to do so I was never bored.

Rigorous and fast pace work place that tends to often times involve tasks that call for prior knowledge and common sense.,"The average day as an  unloader will consist of organizing a series of empty pallets in correlation to their departments, while obtaining rocket and L karts for cosmetics and Grocery items. After preparing the back room, one would usually use pallet jacks t unload bulk already sorted freight out of the truck and proceed to unload loose freight one at a time and push them down the steel scissor line which is collapsible. as freight comes down the line we identify their departments based off of stickers on the freight; in relevance to a numerical system that is dedicated to the department at hand. After trucks are unloaded and freight is sorted all pallets have to delivered to their dedicated locations throughout the supper center via manual Pallet jacks, in cases where pallets are double stacked one uses electronic/hydraulic machines for pallet separation(i.e. Walky Stacks). Throughout the Process of Working for Walmart I've improved my customer service skills and developed a faster and more efficient work ethic due to the rigorous and constant motion of a 24 hour super center that specializes in providing merchandise that fulfills most facets of life.  Management is sound enough to keep the store open, but i feel as if the store would be a more well oiled machine if they didn't let their emotions incur their judgment and respect for those who work under them. Co- workers in Walmart all share the common goal of providing the customer care and service that lives up to the multibillion dollar entity's reputation, and is also comprised of a wide array of races, religions, and ages - more...",4,Current Employee,Gm Receiving Unloader ,"Merrillville, IN",7/10/14,2014,7,10

Workiing as a Mod team associate,"On the arrival of my shift, I am required to locate all the tools responsible for beginning a successful work day . It can range any where from printing out the present modular ,to printing the up and coming modular for the store's future week relay, to generating picks to be restocked on the sales floor. Once done prepping in the backroom for my shift, I am then required to meet with a member of management, as well as a relative job team member, to discuss particularly where I will begin, or where assistance is needed. Then, once everyone is aware of the work load at hand, it is knowledgeable to go over any other job related task so that I can quickly maneuver from one job duty to the next.  Another key responsibility that can also be very useful is reading over the cover letter associated with the modular at hand, to inform you about your current job task. This cover letter assists with the acquired time it takes to complete each modular, as well as making it easier to notice any changes needed to be made within the mod.   In addition to the cover letter, and setting the modular relay, it is then required to clean up unwanted debris and prep any overstock to  maintain a customer- friendly sales floor. Thus allowing any customer to obtain any product visibly needed off the sale's floor without interference of your work. If asked by the customer for a product not visible, you are more then likely to assist each customer to the best of your knowledge with the product.

I also learned to mediate with different companies to process claims on the items.  I learned to effectively communicate with my coworkers as a team to get the job done.  I built great relationships with my managers and managerial team as a whole.  The hardest part of the job was separating the perishable items into specific categories so that I was able to scan each item into the store inventory.

A great place to work because of the customer experiences but management needs great improvement.,I worked as an hourly supervisor for Walmart for over 6 years and really loved the entire experience when Walmart was still a smaller company and was more focused on the customers. Now as Walmart has grown it seems as if the only focus of the entire company is to make money. There is no longer any feeling of appreciation for it's employees or customers. The best part of the job was the co-workers and the customers. We all did everything we could to bring a smile to each others faces and a great overall experience to the day. The hardest part was trying to follow the direction of management that didn't really have an idea of what directions to give. I learned that I am  meant to be with a company that is going to encourage me to strive to make the customer truly happy because that is when I always go home with a smile and wake up with that same smile to begin the next day.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Lima, OH",7/7/14,2014,7,7

Walmart is a great place to shop with very low prices,"A typical day at walmart consists of customer service either as a cashier, service desk associate or Customer service supervisor. As  a cashier you are assigned to a specific register until your 15 minute break. After your break you scan your badge and then get another register assignment. I stay at the register until my lunch or until Im needed at the service desk or as a css. As a manager I try to keep moral up, answer customer service calls promptly and as efficient as possible. I keep up with all calls and tasks at hand with a smile and positive attitude. I love to engage with my co-workers. I am  a problem solver and everyone feels comfortable enough to share anything they are feeling or whatever is on their mind. They trust me to have their best interest in mind. The hardest part of my job is not being able to be in more than one place at a time. Having so much to do at one time that it is sometimes overwhelming. Not having the compensation I should have for the job responsibilities I do on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to do everything I am required to do and more. Even though this job can get overwhelming, I take pride in it and still over exceed all expectations.",2,Current Employee,"Cashier,Service Desk,Customer Service Supervisor ","Englewood, OH",7/7/14,2014,7,7
A terrible place to work.,"A typical day at work involved trying to get through language barriers and attempting to clean a filthy store.

My co-workers did not care either, and would sit in the break room and talk, leaving me to do all the work.

My co-workers were often rude to the manager, the patients, other customers and each other.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of team work and that I often felt as if no one had my back.

"Fast pace, great pay",I enjoyed the fast pace work environment of the job. I learned you  have to create your own system to get the job done. Team work is a must when working on a line. Management can give you good tips on how to do your job more efficiently if you ask. The way you treat your coworkers is the way they will treat you. The hardest part of the job is making sure you don't spend to much time on one thing. The most enjoyable part of the job is meetings every day attended before you go out on the floor to go to work.

Easy going atmosphere where one meets lots of different people,"This was a good work atmosphere, different people of different backgrounds and ethnicities and cultural differences that came together to make a business work. Some days were better than others, it tended to get really busy really quickly. That made for a good day. If it was slow it made a long day, but then one was able to go to different areas of the store and learn something new about the way it was run. Sometimes things did not ring up as they should have, whether it was new merchandise not yet in the system or newly clearanced, one would have to wait for a price check from a team leader.

The typical retail story.,"Walmart, despite its position as a successful retail giant, has many issues behind the scenes that cause issues for its employees on a daily basis. Long work weeks are designed to fall just barely short of full-time, causing employees to be held off on longer waits for benefits. Shifts are often placed on nights and weekends for flow teams and receiving, meaning that having a social life and working the backroom just don't mix. Turnover is high, thanks in part to a mediocre workplace environment, often poor management, and poorly screened hires. I will preface this next statement by saying that some managers in Walmart stores are excellent; however, many of their managers do not have their jobs thanks to previous experience, but rather thanks to management courses provided by Walmart which do not always provide the experience to be a truly effective store manager. As a receiving associate, I watched managers directly contradict each others' instructions, and even re-order products twice over because they couldn't communicate that product orders had been filled already. Some minor safety guidelines were bypassed for convenience, and many a corner was cut by employees and managers alike for little to no gain for the store, sheer laziness at its finest. However, this debacle is saved by many of the employees, good people who band together and ride out the storm that is working at Walmart.",2,Former Employee,Flow Team member ,"Lawrence, KS",7/6/14,2014,7,6

Work at Walmart,"I Clock into work everyday and before I can even get out to the sales floor I am given a list of things to do from my Department manager that she didn't get done before her shift was up, so I make sure this list is done before I do anything else in the department unless a customer needs help then I stop what I am doing to help and focus on the customer.  The assistant store managers I have had a little bit of a problem with because between them there is little to no communication at all so you could be assigned to do a job by one manager and five minutes later you get told to drop what you are doing to do something different for a different manager and it causes a lot of confusion for everyone.  I don't have any problems with most of my co-workers we have a group of us that are hard working and when we are scheduled to work together everything gets done fast and is done right, there are a few that bother me at times because they will disappear in the backroom for hours talking to people who work in the back or hanging around with their significant others in the back and will leave fellow electronic associates out on the floor by themselves trying to do tasks and customer service alone, making it very stressful and causes friction even when a assistant manager is notified what is going on and no actions are taken to fix the problem.

Poorly managed stores but better oportunity than most,"This company is far too scrambled to be this successful. Retail tends to work best when you have few managers and more hourly workers but Walmart has many poor managers and never enough cashiers, cart pushers, sales associates and technicians. Every department seems to be short handed but the top end. Too many chiefs and not enough braves. Now the pay isn't great but it's better than fast food and the benefits aren't terrible. The schedule is usually steady and hours aren't outrageous. Being retail you can't count on getting overtime but in my experience it wasn't too hard to keep my hours up. It was very hard to keep up with demands in the job because of always being short handed. Most of the managers I worked under were not reasonable or very responsible. They would blame everyone under them for all their mistakes and demand what few people we had that we complete the work meant for 2 or 3 times the people. I witnessed several unnecessary terminations because a manager had a personal vendetta or agenda. I have also seen managers select people for promotion based on personal relationships not job merit. On the other hand I had witnessed a few fair, strict and capable managers that I would love to give credit to but I may not use names. I can say that if the company were run by more of these individuals than their stores would be in much better shape. _x000D_On the issue of community, I have witnessed and participated in many good works for the community and charities.

"At first this was a great place to work, but then management started leaving and the place fell apart.","Everyday I would come in pull my 2pm paperwork, check to see how much freight we had left and where we were with price changes.  What I learned is that they expected everything to be done with little or no help.  Meaning that they needed to hire more employees in the homeline area, but were only allowed two associates over there and since one was on loa that still counted as our two. I would say that would be the hardest part of the job, not having enough staff.  I did love my associates, each and everyone have a special place in my heart and we all still keep in contact.",4,Former Employee,ZMS Homelines ,"Sumter, SC",7/2/14,2014,7,2
Rude and uncaring,The management was less than professional. Only cared for personal benefit and almost seemed as there was a quota for firing people and breaking people until they quit. Favorites were played not only personally but in pay ranks as well. Inappropriate relationships were played out and there was no effort to hide these. If you were someone who worked your job then you took on your duties of everyone around you. Stealing was of no issue to the top if you were caught stealing then a blind eye was turned and even worse were the customers people were walking out with TVs and large appliances everyday. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the feminist harassment of customers which no one would help me and the flirting from the top. I learned that the only to progress was to have a physical relationship with your boss. I worked there a year and well educated above many others always tried to better my job and experience turning down advances that were wrong I quit and refuse to do anything legally to protect myself because how large a corporation that walmart is that I know nothing will be done about it and people will continue to get away with whatever they please.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pooler, GA",7/2/14,2014,7,2

My fellow employees were great and even now some of them are still close friends. The pay was alright and the hours were Fantastic.

I've learn how to deal with different customers and create a strong work strategy to make it through the day. My management was strict yet motivating. The hardest part of my job was working in negative 32 degree temperature freezers trying to retrieve products in record time for customers if the previous shift did not stock them.

Typical Work Day as Merchadise Supervisor at Wal-Mart,"As a supervisor over a total of five different departments, managing priorities is key.  First thing in the morning, I would be given a list of manager notes, which needed to be completed by 4pm. After those were completed, I had to make sure all of the previous night's freight was completed, worked, and binned.  Once that was completed, I had to scan my side counters and fill and count all my outs on the shelf.  During this process, I also created counts if my on-hands for a certain product were wrong.  Every week, I needed to complete any mods (merchandise changes on the sales floor) that needed to be done. The last part of my day was usually working on price changes and making sure that every item had the correct label.  _x000D__x000D_Priorities and communication are key is what I have learned.  And making sure there is proper communication has been the hardest part of my job.  Sometimes, directions seemed to get lost in the mix of all of management and my direct supervisor.  _x000D__x000D_The most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers.

Flexible schedule with fun coworkers,"If you like routines in your life and schedule and like to advance quickly in an industry, Wal-Mart is the place to work! I'll be honest when we got new management I was very disappointed. The new manager was running the place like a refugee camp, cutting people's hours left and right and even of those who had been working there for 10 YEARS or more!! I had to resign due to the fact that they would not give me Friday nights or Sunday mornings off for church or school... I'm pretty sure there's a law against this kind of thing, in fact there is! I just know I couldn't go up against such a giant corporation without a great lawyer and ending up paying more than what I'd get to sue a company like Wal-Mart! My coworkers were the best part of the job! The cashiers were like a little family, the hardest part of the job is spending time with friends and family as you will be practically living in your 2nd home with all of the hours they give you!",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate/ Cashier ,"Brea, CA",6/29/14,2014,6,29

Not a fun place to work and there are no pingpong tables,"Generally it isn't that bad. The customers are generally not terrible and the coworkers are generally actually nice people. Management is a lot better than other locations I've read about, but they have a bad time remember when you are or aren't available to work. The hours are atrocious, you could be working late one night and early the next morning. Also, their scheduling is pretty bad, one week you could be working almost 40 hours a week and the next you work around 10. They do give you 1.5 hour break, split into an hour and two 15 minutes breaks, if you work more than six hours. They do also pay pretty decently (I started out at $8.35/hour).",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Bowling Green, OH",6/29/14,2014,6,29

A Great First Job,"Wal-Mart was my first job. You're typical day would be counting the inventory in the back to know how much you need to stock, then taking the items on the sales floor and stocking. You would have to rotate the shelves and also help customers around the store before we closed. I learned the basics of customer service skills there. The management was extremely friendly, and didn't mind helping at the drop of a dime. The coworkers there weren't like coworkers, they were like a family. I enjoyed the peace that came with the job. When you were stocking you could just be in your own little zone. I would say the hardest part of the job was pulling pallets out onto the floor. Especially when they were pallets full of 40 pound bags of dog food.",5,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Brazil, IN",6/29/14,2014,6,29

My managers were ok but were always quick to judge. My co-workers were the best, we actually helped eachother to get our job done. The hardest part of the job is down stacking merchandise to be put in its perspective places.

Do not work for Wal-Mart.,"Wal-Mart is the world's top retailer. Yet they do not compensate their associates accordingly.

Very productive and fun place to work.,Typical day at work is mostly customer service throughout the whole day depending what department u were in. I learned how to use different machines and jacks. I also learned how to unload a truck. Management was fair everybody had different managers. My co-workers was great to work with. Hardest part of the job is a day when we will have to unload two trucks.

Steady and Stable Job as Full Time Employee,"I really liked working at Walmart as a receiving associate and a third shift stock associate. I would go in at ten pm every night and I had supervisors who held nightly meetiings to give each employee their nightly task or work and stock area and other than when a truck arrived at various times of each night and we were all called over the intercom to come to the receiving area to help unload the trucks, I basically worked alone and that was great for learning self disciplined time managment becuase I had to stock  the two aisles in which i was i assigned to and each aisle typically had ten to twelve entirely full pallets full of merchandise that was still in packaeges and wrapped up from the manufactures and it takes a lot of time to unload and stock every thing all on your own before seven am at the end of each shift when all the pallets on the floor had to be on the shelves! Yet, I loved the challenge and the reward of a fully stocked area that was neat and orderly each morning. Unfortunatly I was only hired on at Walmart as a temorary employee and it was fully explained to me at the time of hire that it would only be a temporary position and that nobody that was hired as a temp would be hired as a part time or full time employee and that it was only the longth ofthe entirement which would be up to 190 days and then i could re- apply again as either a temp, which would almost gaurntee a re-hire or a part time or full time  employee that were not even being considered by the company at the time becuase there were not any available openings for those positions.",5,Former Employee,Third Shift Receiving Associate ,"Russellville, KY",6/28/14,2014,6,28

Unorganized and Unprofessional Work Environment,"Although management is aware that the overnight crew is terribly understaffed, they neglect to hire on an appropriate amount of workers. I and one other worker are in charge of stocking merchandise for all infants and apparel departments. Due to different schedules; Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I am in alone in departments 23-31, 33-36, and 79. Management is in charge of designating which workers work in certain areas of the store by using the computer task manager. This system also calculates how long each department should take and many workers are given far more than eight hours of work and given attitude when they can't finish. _x000D__x000D_Management does not praise hardwork so much as overload hardworkers with the extra efforts that other workers refuse to exhibit. And then they refuse to discipline the workers who are careless and don't properly manage their time._x000D__x000D__x000D_The only advantage to working at Walmart for me, other than the obvious reason of not being unemployed, is that the overnight shift allows me to participate in family life, as I have the weekends off and can situate my sleep hours around whatever needs to be done during the day.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service ,"Potsdam, NY",6/28/14,2014,6,28

"Good people to work with overall, and it pays the bills.","At any given day in the beginning of the night I can be asked by management to cover a register and stay there to help out CSMs and their cashiers till the lines of customers die down. I usually help out at least 3 associates with their departments, and when they are helping out a customer and do not know something, they usually come to me. I put up all the freight in my department in a timely manner, check the backroom to see if there is any more, then I zone up, basically clean and straighten up, my department before moving to the next one.

"No job security, high turn over","I worked at Walmart for less than a year. I was laid off, with almost 30 other employees, on the day before I was eligible for benefits. The work was easy and this was meant to be a temporary job while I was in school, but I did not appreciate the constant degrading comments of the head manager on my shift. The hardest part of my job was how I was treated. Her attitude caused a high turnover rate and was the reason the other managers at night took a pay decrease and stepped down from their positions so that they did not have to deal with her.",2,Former Employee,Night Stock ,"Wasilla, AK",6/25/14,2014,6,25
Productive and a overall fun workplace.,I would arrive in the morning and count my cash drawer to make certain it was accurate. I would greet customers and start taking the first customers of the day as the first cashier. Business would start picking up within a short while and my speed picked up in order to accommodate customers. When there were no customers in line I would greet customers and maintain my work area. I answered questions and directed customers to specific items that they requested. Business at Walmart was great and I remained busy at work. The managers were great people as well and they are hard working people. The co-workers that I got to know were hard working people also and I loved their personalities. The job itself is naturally hard work and any employee is tired after a full day at work.

"Terrible, and tense environment","1. A typical day at work would start out pretty good, I would work my carts, we were always short people so double the work, but it didn't matter and then the ZMS would come around and tell me what a worthless worker I was, and how I never do my work. I was working 3 carts an hour plus what ever was considered 'overstock' just in case something could be put out. I would then go to lunch and get ready to unload a truck, a job that was made for more than 3 people, which was all there were of us. Most of the time I would have to unload truck and also Bin overstock. It was a terrible experience. The ZMS had no respect for anyone and even if you got ""Exceeds Expectations"" on your yearly review she would still consider you a worthless person.

A day in the life of a Customer Service Manager at Walmart,"When I go to work in the morning, I usually get all my money ready for the day. I walk the front area where the cash registers are and make sure that they are ready to go. As soon as my service desk associate and my money center associate come in, I give them their money they need for the day. I also walk the area and make notes as to what needs to be done before the store opens, i.e. making sure that there are anti-bacterial wipes in the front vestibules, walk the outside front of the store to make sure there is no trash. Throughout the rest of the day I help customers with any complaints, or any information they need. I make sure that my cashiers are assigned to designated registers. Also I do daily audits on the registers to make sure they are balanced. _x000D__x000D_             I have learned to be very patient by working here.

They allowed me to branch out a bit and learn various positions and jobs which was great!  The only reason for my three stars was because the communication between the management and the front end was poor so no one was ever aware of policy changes until where were warned about it by management.

"productive, fun, and comfortable","At Walmart everyone speaks and tell everyone when clocking into work at 10:00 PM. I go to my work area where my manager tells me to go. I turn my light on at my register and costumers start flowing into my check out line. I meet different kinds of people. Some people are in a rush, some of them in a bad mood, and some just tired from work. After 1:00 AM the lines start slowing down so they pull me and I have to refill all the other registers bags back up for the morning workers.Then I would have to take out the trash under all the registers and take them to the back where the big dumpster. By time I am done with all that it is lunch time and I am back on the register until 7:00 o'clock AM. I learn at working at Walmart that you need a good amount of sleep to work there because it was late night shift. Also time management is really important. The management were pretty fair, they were very understanding. The store was organized well. It was just one thing they did not work around my seclude knowing I was in college. But overall management was great. My co-workers were twice my age. They talked and told me stories about their life and gave me really great advice on life. I also built a strong relationship with them. The hardest part about the job was time management and dealing with people and different moods. Holding your composure and doing the right thing.

"Very productive, multitasking, conflict resolution situations","As a customer service supervisor I ensure that wherever a cash register sits, the store operates smoothly at that register. In our store we handle around 50 registers that are scattered around the store. I also ensure that our cashiers get rotated properly for their breaks and lunches. I make sure the cart pushers in the parking lot are efficient in clearing carts from cars. I also ensure that the door greeters are at their posts greeting customers. I also handle all customer and employee situations and complaints about products in the store. The best part of being a supervisor is the multitasking. I never get a chance to sit much and I love being productive. The hardest part about working there is the job pay is very low for the amount of work performed as a supervisor. Management is very inconsistent because there are at least 5 different managers on one shift and they all have different answers on questions and don't know how to perform certain functions in the store. It's very safe to say that the employees working at walmart know how to run the store better than the management does when it comes to literally running the register, stocking items in the system, etc.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Waynesboro, Pa",6/23/14,2014,6,23
Good and safe place,Walmart was my first job as a student. It was a good place to start with as a college student to make some money to cover my life expenses. Christmas party was one of the most enjoyable day of the job.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Houston, TX",6/23/14,2014,6,23

Horrible job.,Ok I am a cashier in month two I must say this job is appaling. First management is horrible. They hate me because I go beyond my job for the customers. They count something called scans per minute. The average is 850 per hour. I am always getting yelled at because I am at 700 to 7 something.I am too busy giving good customer service. The customers like me they even tell me this. I have many repeat customers. Management is always throwing me under the bus even telling lies because I am the opposite of them. I have seen them lie to customers I have seen them ignore handicapable elderly customers. They put the cashiers especially me infront of the door as a door greeter constantly. When they see me enjoying my job they lie about me and make me feel bad. There is no training at all. I learned nine hours of how to spot and stop unions how to identify diseases and spills how to use a box cutter even ladder safety. But nothing to do with my actual job as a cashier. I learned from other cashiers and from a few mistakes on how to operate a cash register. I hate going into that place everyday now. I work most days from 2 pm to 11 pm or 1 pm to 10 pm. I never signed on to be there at 7 am to 3 pm somedays. Today they were pushing it. I came close to throwing my phone through the ice box breaking the window. I have had dreams lately of cursing them out then walking out. Tonight it was time for me to leave I was at speedy checkout I had three customers. I nicely and respectfully told them it was time for me to go home. This cashier that had been nice to me lately was at cashier nine.

Hated it.,"Never work for Walmart. When they first opened, they got it right. As soon as the new CEO came into play, it was all down hill from there.

Great place to work,A typical day working as a cashier at Walmart would include seeing hundreds of people a day and ringing up their items and providing them with good customer service and making them want to shop at Walmart. I learned that there are all kinds of different people out there and you have to learn how to deal with them and connect with them even if they are different than you are. I loved all of my coworkers. They are all awesome people and we worked together. Management was great also. If there was an issue or problem I would have felt comfortable talking to them about it and I know they would have done whatever they could have to take care of the issue. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who you just could not please no matter how hard you tried. Another hard part of the job were the hours. The most enjoyable part was how busy we always were and the day flew by and I had regular customers who I enjoyed seeing each week!,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bedford, IN",6/22/14,2014,6,22
Tense at times.,"Management was good about getting things done, but at times seemed they pushed a bit too much. Even if you had a sore arm or back they still wanted you to stock the heaviest isle. They seem the rate you lower to try and get you to perform more._x000D__x000D_They times listed in the computer were not accurate. If you had 2 hours worth of freight to stock, it was sometimes 4-5 hours worth._x000D__x000D_Employees worked well together to get the job done.

Working at Walmart,"What I have learned working in this place to become a better team player. This job I have learned a lot from interacting with my co-workers what is acceptable and not acceptable in a work place. I have a lot of respect for my co-workers and I feel sorry for everyone that management doesn't seem to care about any one of us. We all try our best to live up to their rules and expectations that seems to change every day. We have had people quit because the work load is too much and this intimidates new people why they usually never end up lasting. I work hard in my department to help ease the tension off my other co-workers but sadly this place is not my calling. As much as I like my co-workers I cannot stay here for them, I have to think of myself and my goals. I want to get my art career off the ground and explore the limitless opportunities that is just waiting around the corner. I know it is not easy to find a job in my field of computer animation but I am optimistic that I will find something eventually.",2,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Salem, NH",6/22/14,2014,6,22

Challenging,"In my 10 years as a Wal-mart associate I have learned to cover your self. If you change to price on an item or deviate from policy you had better be able to explain why. Was it for the good of keeping a regular customer? How will it benefit the company in the long run. Also, be honest with your customers and your coworkers. People hate being lied to especially if they find out later. Be honest from the start. You will avoid challenges later as long as you are honest from the get-go.",3,Current Employee,Connection Center Associate ,"Charlotte, NC",6/22/14,2014,6,22
A grocery and merchandise store to buy items,"My shift would start with clocking in for my shift, go to an assigned register, sign in to register, open drawer to make sure money was counted and placed in drawer correctly. Turn my light on and be ready for a customer to come in my line. I've learned to be considerate and courteous to customers and co-workers. The management team wants you to ensure customers are happy with the products they are buying. The hardest part of the job is long-time standing. It gets tiring on your feet and your legs. I face the shelves that need to be stocked. Keeping busy is the key to being happy at your job. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you've helped a customer with all of their needs.",3,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Pottstown, PA",6/22/14,2014,6,22

"Worked hard, fun and interesting people",My typical work day involved me clocking in locating a manager getting my job requirements for that day. In addition to help checking out everyone and making sure they found everything they needed. I also made sure I stayed busy which would also mean cleaning. The hardest aspect of my days are when a person has been drinking and wants to buy alcohol and I had to refuse the sell.

Fast paced work enviorment with lots of interesting people.,Overall my experience at Wal-Mart has been a pleasant one.

Busy paced job,"A typical day at work included me clocking in, opening a front register, counting cash in my drawer, and helping customers.  I learned how to accomodate every customer no matter if it were a complaint, bad experience, etc.  I also did some personal shopping at times for the elderly or handicapped.  The middle management teams at Walmart are motivating and great.  Always running around and helping employees.  Upper management is rarely seen in my opinion.  I don't really think there was a major hard part of the job, however, it was challenging during the retail holiday sales.  Extremely fast paced.  Kept me on my toes.  The best thing about the cashier position I had was that I met many many people and it didn't feel repetitious.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Manteca, CA",6/22/14,2014,6,22
An okay place,"Not the best place to work, but its a start.

"Co-Workers fun, but money and scheduling not the greatest","The hardest part of my job is being able to be in multiple different places while still being pulled to this side and that.  It is especially difficult during the holiday hours when staffing isn't as great as it could be.  Management are nice, engaging, and try their best to make it a better work environment, though sometimes it is hard to find them.  This job is great when making certain displays in which a variety of management and coworkers get involved, and also during CMN events where everyone tries to pitch in and have fun.  The largest downsides are pay and scheduling.  It takes a while for you to make enough for it to really make a difference and electronic scheduling is unable to appropriately schedule people for coverage and at some points you really don't get a personal life with what it gives you.",2,Current Employee,Photo Center Technician ,PA,6/21/14,2014,6,21

Pass the blame,"Initially the store was very fun to work with.  When a new store manager was brought in, it was clear that this individual did not have a clue as to what they were doing.  Orders to restock inventory were being rejected leaving out of stock issues in many departments and department managers were ridiculed by upper management because they couldn't keep their inventory flowing consistently. Before the new store manager came in department managers had an opportunity to try new ideas with merchandise and build exciting shops in their departments, but with the new manager in place the outside vendors were cut out and the ability to build those higher demand shops was no longer available.  Everything became by the layout only and no creativity was allowed outside the requirements of the minimal expectations. As the restructure took place the value of customer service decreased.  The job was enjoyable with the team members, but the upper management really had no clue about the task loads that the sales floor had to deal with on a daily basis.  Overnight stocking crew was like a skeleton crew so that department employees spend most of their day stalking shelves rather than focusing on creatively merchandising.  All in all, this is a good job people who don't like to think outside the box.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Elk River, MN",6/20/14,2014,6,20
"Work-driven, competitive, yet laid-back","A typical day at work for me includes stocking the milk, the eggs, then the orange juice, the yogurt, cream cheese, butter, biscuits, and cheese. That's about 80% of the job. The other percentage includes helping customers with the location of some items, help them with any questions they have. Also, when the truck comes in with new items, someone has got to put those in the bins in the cooler. That takes some time. There is a lot of physicality with this work. This work requires a lot of self-discipline and generally, it's a good idea to get things done faster to get everything in or else the shelves on the salesfloor won't look that impressive. There's also zoning.",4,Current Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Cumming, GA",6/20/14,2014,6,20

My workday,"All the cash, WIC vouchers and coupons for each register are turned in every night in their designated register bags and I go through each one accordingly every morning. I use the 10-key system to key in the quantity for each denomination for each register into the SMART system. Then, the profit for each register is calculated. The WIC vouchers and the checks are also individually entered into the SMART system. The deposits are prepared and are ready for bank pickup. I keep account of the daily and monthly paperwork. The coupons are mailed out weekly. I review each register, record then research the registers that have overages or shortages for that day. The hardest part of my job is finding out the reason why the registers were not balanced and communicating with all of my coworkers until the problem is found and a solution is made. The most enjoyable part is the calm environment while sorting out the register bags.",3,Current Employee,Accounting Office Associate ,"Marietta, GA",6/18/14,2014,6,18

Working At Walmart,"When I First started I was excited because I had heard so many great things about working there and soon as I got hired I found out it wasn't, they made you do your work and other jobs that was not in your job description and when you asked for a rise in pay to do two or three different jobs in one day they would say no. the workers was great we help each other through the day but other a period of time the work became frustrating and annoying and it made me not want to come in some days, you couldn't call out from work and not be penalized for it if you had a reason you couldn't bring in doctors notes or files stating you was sick or in the emergency room they did not accept them or want to see them. overall the pay for the amount of work and frustration did not match even a little bit and benefits was poor.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Jacksonville,6/13/14,2014,6,13

People at the job,"This job was very unorganized. It seemed as though throughout the workday, there was no help from any management.

Love the fun family atmosphere but..zero pay..,"I've worked for Wal-Mart 3 years in the Produce department as an sales associate and as an whole I've liked it, my typical day is extremely boring and predictable, honestly that's how I like it though to a degree if you don't like that I would not reccomend Wal-Mart at all.. I love the environment of being around a lot of people since I work in a supercenter and management really does treat me like family a lot of times I've met managers and co-workers i'll remember for the rest of my life, but bottom line the pay is nothing, my wage is still around minimum wage after 3 years, I've gotten only 40. cent raises every year and a lot of the time management just treats me like a robot and expects me to do to much, if you need a job quick Wal-Mart would be great and if you have plans of being a manager one day as well..but please don't do it and just be a sales associate for many years and expect any $$ :(..",3,Current Employee,Produce Sales Associate ,"Oklahoma City, OK",6/13/14,2014,6,13

Hours were cut frequently. It was nice to work with so many people, and with better management and appreciation of employees which sometimes did the work of 5 by themselves, this would be a great place to work. Benefits are great especially if full time.

Walmart,I expected a little more from Walmart. I applied with a degree in Psychology and minor in Business Marketing. I thought that would at least get me a spot at a register but it did not.

Great Experience,"A typical day at Wal-mart. I would Clock in at 1pm   there would be  two pallets of orders that people ordered from Walmart.com . I would finalize that the orders haveb arrived and I would binned it in a specific location. When the customer comes I would be able to look it up in the system and find it . If  the order didn't arrived I would call Field Support and figure A solution to the problem. Next I would go to Customer Service help Customers with Refunds and Returns or go on the sales floor and sell TV's . I would also Clean out the bale area With an  Electrical pallet jack and set Up to unload trucks which we would get at least  two trucks with twenty five hundred pieces on each truck. I would help unload them as well basically  I did everything at Wal-mart. I learned that when your working for a company the customer is always first  to stay professional and polite but firm at the same time. I also learned how to change prices manage a team on the sales floor, drive a Fork Lift and manage Inventory. Our management was some what helpful but i had to really push things and learned them on my own. The hardest part of my job would probably be intervene with an employee and angry customer and finding a solution so the customer could be satisfied and  we could make the sell.",3,Former Employee,Electronic Associate ,"Apopka, FL",6/12/14,2014,6,12

They can take off or put on days without associate consent, even though it is against policy. There are not enough associates to go around to fulfill department needs.

I have learned to work in a fast paste environment I have also learned how to work with demanding customers and associates answering difficult questions while enforcing company policy. Management relies on Customer service Mangers to answer difficult but small problems within reason so they can continue to the store. Co-workers relies on me for customer care questions Policy information and taking care of the customer. The hardest part of the job for me is learning all that can even though I am knowledgeable about the policy there is always changes in the policy that we don't always know about or its not always stated we can step out of our policy if the situation requires that we do so. But we also have to get approval from management.

A fun place to work when the associates work together,"I love working for this company although I have reservations about some of the policies not put into action.  A lot of times there are shortcuts made to display the appearances of a compliant successful company.  Some managers turn a blind eye to the quality of complete stocking and safety practices.  Things like this can only encourage my efforts to strive more for a better performance to compensate when the actions of some are lacking.  As in any company or work team, there are weak members as well as strong ones.  Some have to step out of the bare minimum and lift the others up to provide a high quality environment for shoppers to come find the necessities of their every day lives.  Although I enjoy the challenge of achieving more in less time, constantly fixing repeditive mistakes carries a monotonous tone after a while.",4,Current Employee,Overnight stocker ,"Moline, IL",6/11/14,2014,6,11

After the remodel was over, some people were offered permanent positions aka start over from scratch since the time that we worked there didn't count towards getting benefits. Most got laid off. The ones that got to stay are the ones who never did their job and would disappear for most of the night. My co-workers were awesome except for the few slackers. I was able to get my forklift license after begging for the test for 3 months. After I got certified, I was never on a forklift again because the guys were always chosen to do it.

Only if you need experience on your resume.,"Typical day included being in charge of maintaining multiple departments at once on my own and being expected to do the work of 5 people at once. After a while I learned the reason to over load associates with work was to help management fore workers before they could get to a pay raise so they could keep rehiring and maintaining pay rates at the minimum $7.25 rate. Management was also TERRIBLE, as there were about 5 managers for every three associates on the floor, and rarely did a manager try to listen or help resolve any issues. The hardest part was when there were two customers that kept coming into the store to harass me, they refused to get security or to resolve the harassment issues to the point of blaming me for their showing up. Nothing about this job was enjoyable, and it was stressful to the point that I left without notice because they refused to give me a raise, do anything about the verbal/s.exual harassment, and high workload.

Positive workplace experience,"After four years of working at one place, friendships are bound to be made.  This fact remained true with my experience at Walmart.  I formed a solid bond with my co-workers, one that still stands today.  The experience I took away is invaluable; I started as a cashier, where I learned how to handle money as well as customers.  From there I worked at the service desk, which is primarily focused on customer returns and money transfers.  The most important lesson I learned from that particular position was how to handle unpleasant customers; dealing with pleasant customers is easy, but it takes a special employee to effectively interact with angry customers.  I also worked as a customer service manager, which gave me important experience in schedule managing as well as over-all problem solving around the store.  Management viewed me as a utility employee who could do it all, and I took great pride in playing that role.  The hardest part of the job was keeping one's chin up during the holiday seasons, but the most enjoyable was by far receiving gratitude from customers and fellow employees.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Flora, Illinois",6/10/14,2014,6,10

Some managers sympathize with the workload and will actively contribute to completion. Most just watch. The stores are so understaffed that most merchandise sits in the backroom. Often you will have numerous out of stocks, resulting in unhappy customers. Many co-workers are frustrated too, because the stores look like disaster areas. There are numerous political intrigues to contend with. The home office makes arbitrary and capricious decisions without looking at impacts.

Fun workplace with positive attitude and energy,"Walmart is the world's largest leading retailer and after working here, it is very easy to tell why. The people that are hired in are one of a kind. They are some of the nicest people to work with and it doesn't take much to get along with them and feel like you are welcomed to the store. Each individual strides to make the customer come first in any situation. Every associate is willing to stop immediately with what they are doing to make sure the customer finds what they want or gets the help they need on getting items out of reach or far to heavy for one person to grab. Management is some of the best around. Every manager is there to help you succeed and to help you every step of the way. No manager just sits around and does nothing. Every manager is either on the sales floor, working with customers and doing some of the dirty work themselves with keeping the shelves neat or setting up new displays, or they are in the backroom, helping with trucks, keeping track of inventory, making sure all of the backroom associates are doing well. The only hard part about your day will just be getting everything that is handed to you done on time. Most of the time, you are given many tasks to complete in one day and sometimes, there just isn't enough time in the day to do so.

Stressful workplace environment,"There was very little organization within the operation of the store. That was to be expected though. A 24-hour store that was the most popular shopping place in Huntsville, TX; that only makes sense. Most of the employees were college students and so that created an unstable work flow. There was always plenty to do, which was great. I was always busy. But I never knew how many hours I was going to get during the week. It constantly fluctuated between 19-36 hours.

"Fun, customer service oriented workplace",A typical day at work for me is all about planning. I take a list of associates and delegate tasks to those associates throughout the store. Often times I can be found at the registers helping customers or on the floor helping other associates. I learn something new on a daily basis. I strive to gain as much experience as possible. Being one of the few who make it into the management teams through Wal-mart I feel as though they give hard workers such as myself the chance to succeed. Through this company I have learned to delegate task with the understanding of what needs to be done. I have also had the opportunity to strive in excellent customer service as well as facilitate an entire department as a supervisor. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the results of my hard work and dedication. Seeing a task complete is what makes going back the next day worth it.,4,Current Employee,Inventory Management Supervisor ,"Lancaster, CA",6/9/14,2014,6,9
Manual labor at it's worst,"On a typical work night we started off with our Wal-Mart meeting talking about how we as a team are important to the welfare of Wal-Mart, if we hit our quota the previous night, and our truck count for the evening. We ended our meetings with our Wal-Mart cheer and went to work not before checking our individual tasks. This would let us know which departments, we were assigned to and how many hours we had in said departments. The newest employees usually move from department to department until they find a place that management feels suits them. Management's optimal goal was to have one person for 3 departments. Now each department was about 8 to 12 hours depending on the truck night, imagine working 2  departments let alone 3 under those conditions. They hired infrequently, when someone would quit or terminated, they usually wouldn't fill their position for at least 2 months. Leaving all that extra weight on our shoulders, not managements. Since the manager was especially hard on the assistant managers, the assistant managers were hard if not harder on us. When asked by assistant managers and fellow employees that we needed extra hands on board, he would always say something like, ""Oh, we're currently looking"" and ""we actually have already hired some people."" He also refused to hire based off of Wal-Marts incentive giving Management a nice bonus if they had less employees. _x000D_Management was a wreck, most the time they didn't know what they were doing. Some of our managers actually got in trouble for harassment at one point and they were still hired there.

The Most Enjoyable Part of Working at Walmart.............,"I truly enjoyed working for Walmart.

Fun and not to slow,"Walmart was a great place to work I never got bored.  Between the work I was assigned, helping customers there was always something to do.  in a typical day I would come in to work and clock-in then attend the daily meeting.  After the meeting was over I would go check my guide to see what work I needed to accomplish that night. Normally I would be working on stocking shelves in the grocery section of the store.  After working for about 2 hours I would get my first 15 minute break so i would get a quick drink and get some air.  then i would go back to work until my lunch break.  After my 1 hour   lunch I would would go back to work for the next 2 hours which then I would get my final 15 minute break. When my final break was over i would have to finish stocking the shelves and then zone the shelves.  Which means i would have to pull the stock Items out to the front of the shelves so the customers would  be able to see all the products on the shelf.  Zoning usually took about an hour.

when working at walmart,"You are told where to go by a machine, try not to take too long to get to where it tells you, (bathroom breaks or any reason) you can get written up for such acts, you must not have any confrontation at all with the customer that's your bosses job. you get a 15 minute break from WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR REGISTER. you must remember this; they will write you up for being even a minute over, and it is your responsibility to ask EVERY customer for the Walmart credit card, and remember if you don't ask that is a write-up-able offence and your responsibility to ask EVERY customer. It's also your responsibility to be fast while dealing with the customers if your items per hour is below 485 you will get written up or terminated, and remember at any point it's up to the managers discretion whether your being insubordinate or not....when you get your lunch break your given an hour but typically your boss will ask you to take 30 minutes, you are not to leave your register at the end of the day until your manager tells you to, as well as going to any of your breaks is up to your managers discretion, The best part of that job was probably the coworkers to help train and break up the monotony with and also to make a small network of people that care about each other and try to help. I also liked management typically unless someone who let the power go to their head got in the managerial position, my favorite part of this job was dealing with the good people and helping the good people, the hardest part was most of the job but I did not talk about it until now.",3,Former Employee,cashier/backup CSM ,"Scarborough, ME",6/5/14,2014,6,5

review,"It was a good job except they expected too much out of one person. They should hire more employees to do the job. It is a 2 person job that one person is doing and if a customer needs help then that takes time away. If everything is not put away by when they want it then they get upset, but the customer always comes first. If there were more stockers we wouldn't be in such a rush. Quality and friendly service should come first. I should have time to put the new products behind the older products which will expire first so that we can have good management of the products in waste control.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Tampa, FL",6/5/14,2014,6,5

A fun and active place to work,"A typical day at work is non-stop.  I learned something everyday from either my fellow management team or an hourly associate.  The management teams always worked extremely well together.  Total store we considered ourselves ""a family"".  It was a nice feeling to know that we all worked together to get the same result.  The hardest part of the job was the work-life balance, expectations were really difficult when issues arose.  I totally enjoyed my job, the relationships you make with our customers as well as each other.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Onley, VA",6/4/14,2014,6,4
Working for walmart was an opportunity to meet wonderful people while receiving great benefits.,Walmart was a four year job for me and while there I met people who became a part of my family.

disorganized management,Unloading and stocking shelves with merchandise from truck orders. There were multiple pallets full with merchandise and not enough staff to finish the work in the allowed time. i learned how to use the pallet jack as well as the system in which to locate where merchandise is the be found. Management is horrible. One manager is very unorganized and unprofessional. She has a terrible work ethic as well as a horrible attitude towards her employees. The hardest part of my job was working with incompetent co-workers as well as the manager. There was nothing enjoyable about the job. The hours were not fitting to my personal schedule and the pay is absolutely terrible for how many hours you work a week. The pay did not match the amount of work that was expected to be done in an 8 hour shift. I do not recommend this job to anyone.

Unprofessional and unethical,A lot of jobs at walmart revolve around weather or not you are willing to bend over backwards for one particular manager and make it like the rest dont exist. each manager has their own agenda and dont really care about what anyone else cares or says due to the fact they are trained to believe they are right 100% of the time regardless of how many ways you can prove them wrong or show a better more effective way of doing something.,3,Former Employee,Stocker/Cashier/Manager/Unloader ,"Goose Creek, SC",6/3/14,2014,6,3

They would give me dirty looks all the time and talk poorly about me behind my back. When the Dr gave me a note of things I could and couldn't do, they basically just laughed and made me do those things anyways. Tehy were in no way willinng to help me at all.

I felt invisible,"When I first started working at Wal-Mart, I felt like I was apart of the team. As if my inputs mattered. After awhile, all of the previous managers changed. At this point, I felt as if I didn't have a voice. Every time I asked the manager something, I would get a smart answer that didn't even answer the question. I just felt useless to the company because the things that I could do, I wasn't doing. I knew the job of being a picker/puller, and when I asked for that job opening, I was passed up. The job was given to someone who didn't even want the job. One day, I had went to the new GM of our store and asked if I could apply for the cashier job that was opened. He told me, ""NO."" and left it at the without explanation. The one thing that I didn't enjoy too much was working under four managers at the same time, and all of them telling me four different things to do. And every time I told them what the other manager told me to do, I would get in trouble. I was able to work with all my co-workers. Sometimes, instead of going to the managers for help, which by the way were the hardest people to find when you needed them, they would often find me and I would help or guide them.",2,Former Employee,"O/N Stocker, O/N Picker ","Victoria, TX",6/3/14,2014,6,3

A Day at Work,A normal day at work involves a lot of interaction with our management team but even more interaction with customers.  At Wal-Mart customers come first and notes come second.  I have learned a whole lot since working at Wal-Mart like the correlation between inventory and sales.  The management team at Wal-Mart were good on giving directions but I believe that improvements could made on helping associates grow within the company.  The hardest part about this job would have to be helping the large amount of customers.  Sometimes it get very hectic in the store and crowd control is essential to making sure all of the customers get taken care of.

It was nice while it lasted,"I always wanted to wear the blue nametag for some reason, it was kind of a goal of mine when I was in high school. I thought that it would be the perfect place to start my career but boy was I wrong. Yes they give out bonuses discounts and so on but what they don't tell you is that you have to be there one complete year before you receive anything (6 months for discount). Their healthcare plan sucks they will pay half of the expenses but then you're on your own after that but you have to meet a certain amount of requirements for them even to consider paying. I just couldn't take it anymore the management was terrible nothing ever got done and it was just a sucky place to be. They don't work around your needs or availability my manager told me ""Either you're here when we want you to be or you can leave."" so I left on to look for bigger and better opportunities. The hardest part about that place was that the chain of command was broken, badly. When it got busy on Fridays and Saturdays every department would be confused on what to do and how to do things. Especially my department. The store barely had any carts so when it got busy there would only be a slim number of carts for the customers, they are very short staffed from people getting fed up with the treatment or someone getting fired.

All of my coworkers were excellent. Great hard working people, and I would say that was the best part of the job. Being able to help people and meet new energetic customers every day. Working at Walmart made me very adaptable to different situations in the workforce, they always had us doing something different. That really helped in getting me prepared for all the different jobs out there.",3,Former Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE ASSOCIATE ,"Chubbuck, ID",6/2/14,2014,6,2
"Not a bad place to work at, they just don't pay as well as they should.","A typical day at work consists of unloading our truck, down stacking and restacking some grocery pallets, pulling pallets to the floor, and picking merchandise. I've learned how a shipping/receiving warehouse operates. Management seems to be a bit crazy at some times, constantly checking to see how close we are to having the truck unloaded. I get along with my coworkers that are good workers, but not so much the ones that are slow, or seem to come in either drunk/high. The hardest part of my job is pulling a pallet of salt/dirt somewhere. The most enjoyable part of my job is that it feels like a workout more often than not.",3,Current Employee,Unloader ,Shipping/Receiving,6/2/14,2014,6,2
Ok job for a stepping stone in your career search.,I would show up on a Friday and it would be hot. We would have 5-7 cars outside and 2 workers. Somebody would have left the company today for a better paying and less overbearing job. The supervisors would work with you on most of the work. The assistant manager would walk around and go off on the other employees and managers for no reason. Sometimes the assistant managers would use foul language while addressing the employees which is against company policy. With the money I make I cannot live comfortable on my own and pay my bills. The best part of my job is the interesting people I have met over the last 4 years. The hardest part of my job is putting up with disrespect and low wages.,2,Current Employee,Tire&Lube Technician ,"Norfolk, VA",6/2/14,2014,6,2

The managers were always helpful and was always there when they were called. The best part about my job at Wal-Mart were my co- workers they work as hard as I did and we always had fun outside of work never mixing the two. The hardest part of my job was the training, its kind of a challenge when you have you own way of doing your job and you have to show someone from scratch how to do it all over again. I enjoyed helping people who had know clue that certain things could be done, they would come angry but they always left with a smile on their  faces and was satisfied.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Randallstown, MD",6/2/14,2014,6,2
The professionalism problems.,"Honestly, I was not impressed with the professionalism with the Wal-Mart I worked at. The customer service there was not up to par like the other retail stores I have observed. The managers like to ignore the ideas the associates suggested to make the store a better place to shop, which made more associates quit, including myself. _x000D__x000D_I did enjoy some associates, some of them stayed professional and had excellent customer service, but all in all, I was not impressed.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Friendswood, TX",6/2/14,2014,6,2
Staff at Store #2945 allowed Bullying on Overnight Shift,"I was an Overnight Processor and a Department Manager.

Then, there were the Bullys, which besides my promotion were a main reason for me to leave Overnight, even though the pay was better than a Department Manager. As a Department Manager, I was thrown into the position. This Walmart had a ""Sink or Swim"" approach to all it's positions. The hardest part of my job as trying to communicate with a manager that cared about the employees and company, than their paycheck.

Once in a while there will be that one customer that doesn't like absolutely anything you have to say. The co-workers are fun to work with and management is easy to get along with. They are not too hard on you unless you are not doing what you are supposed to be doing. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers.

Management and pay were horrible.,"The work itself is easy.  But I like to call the management ""Predatory"", because if you are a good worker, the managers will jump on you and work you to death and hold you accountable for everything, all the while saying this will move you up and your creating opportunities for yourself, while they take all the credit and you get no where.  I can't tell you how many times I overheard a manager take credit for hard work that I had done, saying things like ""Yeah, I took care of that"".   If your a worker who just does enough to get by and stays under the radar and makes it difficult for the manager to get you to do anything, you'll be good, because it takes to much effort on there part, so, the best thing to do is just make there job as tough as possible and they'll leave you alone for the most part.",2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Metairie, La.",6/1/14,2014,6,1

Saving money for customers equates to low wages and high stress!,"Saving people money, is the mantra of Walmart. However, this means cutting production costs...at all costs. Many departments are void of employees during the day. I hear of customers searching for help, only to find empty isles with unstocked shelves and no associates to help. The stress of this fact is put on the few employees that walmart does have during the day, who often are forced to cover many departments. The frustration continues as management wonders why their picks and freight aren't completed. Threats and verbal abuse is likely to pursue as they have no understanding as to what workload the floor associates really have to deal with. Many workers are civil human beings with a consciousness, who wish to help others in need. We help our customers find products, answer questions, and provide a friendly shopping environment. This must all be thrown out the door in order to meet up with the demands of management and in order to keep your job. This is not the company to work for.

The organization and attention to employee safety is top notch, and you are handsomely rewarded for many different things. NOT a place for those who whine or want to get paid for easy work.

retail sales,on a typical day working for wal mart started out just going to work and working hard trying to get as much done as possible and providing assistance in other departments when needed. this drive put me into a management position within one year of starting with wal mart I was in the TLE department and pushed sales to 3 times the previous sales in the first three weeks. the hardest part of this job was having to fix issues caused by my employees. the most enjoyable part of this job was being able to keep my customers happy and coming back to our store.,4,Former Employee,Retail Sales ,"Scottsdale, AZ",5/31/14,2014,5,31

structured,"Before each shift there was a meeting on how the store was doing, goals and what each person needed to do for the night. I learned organization, how to work and help customers at the same time, information on a wide variety of product. Most of management was awesome, it just took time to see how each manager did things and what they expected. I was even able to get along with one of the most unapproachable managers because I took my job seriously. The hardest part of my job was remembering so much information at the start but there were always other employees that were very helpful.

Horrible work atmosphere with inconsiderate management,"A typical day in the Lawn and Garden center I would check customers out, work freight that had came in the night before, zone and clean shelves, assist customers with purchases, load customers with outdoor furniture, potting soil, manure, mulch, etc. I learned several things about gardening and horticulture during my time at Walmart. My co-workers for the most part were helpful and willing to assist whenever I needed help and we worked as a team. Management, however, were rude, inconsiderate, and too demanding.

Great starter job for high school students.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative/ Cashier ,Virginia,5/30/14,2014,5,30
horrible management,"Horrific managers overall. They don't care for the workers safety let alone the workers period. Only looked out for themselves and they're money.

No work life balance or respect for store management,"Wal-Mart is not a bad company to work for. The benefits aren't any worse than any other company. The management training program is phenomenal and I hear its getting better and better. Your Store Manager makes the difference. If your store manager values work/life balance and sees it as a valuable tool to increase moral and productivity then you will enjoy increased moral and productivity from your associates and you will be successful. Not to mention the fact that your family will not forget what you look like. If not, then get ready to be broken DOWN. Like 12hr a day/ 6 days a week broken down. And you don't get paid for all those extra hours (if you are exempt) and you're lucky if they are comped. And your associates feel it too. They force unreasonable expectation on lower management and associates and your job become impossible to enjoy. _x000D_So make sure when you are interviewed by your potential store manager you do some interviewing of your own and make sure that his/her values line up with yours.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,MO,5/30/14,2014,5,30

Being able to bring joy to their lives by giving them a excellent customer service.,5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Manager ,"Mays Landing, NJ",5/30/14,2014,5,30
Frustrating,Wal-mart is determined to not have anymore full time employees. They will give you full time hours up to the point you are going to be full time and then cut  you back just long enough that you start all over again. That keeps them from giving you benefits. You can average 45 hours a week but never come out on top. They hire a lot of people who could care less about showing up for work or even working once they get there. I loved decorating the cakes as well as the customers.,3,Former Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Springdale, AR",5/30/14,2014,5,30

Long time and great employees are unhappy with how management treat them and also say the ""old"" walmart and managers was better and more family oriented. A lot of employees will tell you it is just about a paycheck and are miserable while they are at work. Even new assistant managers tranfers or want to within a few months of being there.

Stressful Work Environment without Enough Associates,"A typical day at work in the deli includes checking for assignments, filling sales floor merchandise, ordering product daily, pulling expired dates and processing product, cooking food, checking and logging temperatures, putting away overstock, constantly cleaning everything, slicing deli meat and cheese, and above all friendly customer service. I have been with this company for nearly seven and a half years. I have trained in multiple positions throughout the store. I understand the overall ins and outs of store operations, from the unloading of the trucks to ordering merchandise based on rate of sales this year compared to last year. The hardest part of any of the positions that I have been in is, not have any associates to delegate to when trying to efficiently manage the department. You are the department's manager, merchandiser, stocker, zoner, sales associate, and customer service provider. Sometimes one person just isn't enough. Now, working in the deli has its moments.

very productive daily and had fun doing work,I love my co-workers we we were family because you spent most of your time with them rather than your own family at home or at least thats what it felt like. A typical day for me at walmart was making sure I ran te business but had fun doing it. Management was good we all work together to get projects done on a timely manner. Its nothing wrong with management help te associates and working together that only helps the business. In my opinion when you care your accociates will give you 100% of wor rather than 50%. The most hardest part of the job was my last day of work it was very emotional for me and my coworkers. We had fun days all the time dont get me wrong we got our jobs done but we just live for the moment and worked together because we have had really challenging moments at work but we had the best group of associates that cared for each other and their store.,5,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Dallas, TX",5/28/14,2014,5,28

Hour long lunches,I would clock in and go see a member of management and find out what register I was assigned. I would then ring people up and bag their groceries.  I feel like I was only a number. I loved waiting on people and talking to customers. I only knew a few coworkers since people were always coming and going. I think they were really nice and still talk to them when I go to Wal Mart.

Love being able to help customers,"A typical day for me would be walking my area seeing the changes that need to be done. Checking to make sure my Department Managers are scanning and doing their daily functions. Checking for new merchandise in the backroom to take to the floor that customers may want to buy. Morning meeting to receive notes to add to my notes to delegate or do myself while still providing excellent customer  service. I've learned how to work with others and how to listen to their needs instead of acting like i care actually going above and beyond to show them by, helping with their assignments or helping them solve problems so that they can get through their day. As a manager I have to listen, be a role model, show integrity, responsibleness, strength and willingness to get the job done with a smile. The hardest part is going to my upper management team with a problem and instead of them being a willing and listening party they  always have to display the negative and push back as if my concerns are not important to them, that's why when my associates come to me I make sure i figure out a way to be helpful or at least take time to see  what the problem is before i show I don't care. The most enjoyable part is when I go above and beyond to help a customer and they see it and and really appreciate my help but being able to satisfy drives me and put a smile on my face",2,Current Employee,Merchandise Supervisor ,"Little Rock, AR",5/28/14,2014,5,28

"Don't ever work here, EVER!",When I first started this job I honestly didn't mind it. Management seemed nice and so did other employees. But after about 3 months they started to show their true colors. Management would tell you one thing and then yell at you for it not even an hour later. For example I was told we could clock in 5 minutes early as long as we either clocked out 5 minutes early or took 5 extra minutes on our lunch. Well I did this for almost 6 months and once the 6 months was over they gave me a paper saying they marked me as absent from work for 2 days because of all the early clock-outs and clock-ins I had. Who does that?? I was also told when hired in that I would get 32 hours a week guaranteed and that I'd be working on the sales floor. Well 4 months into the job I got cut down to 20 hours and they wanted me to do registers when I had never been trained on them! They lie and try to get you to quit. My friend who worked with me was employee of the month twice and they told him he didn't qualify for a raise on his anniversary as well. Nothing they do makes sense and all they do is lie and cheat their employees out of the money they earn.,2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"North Canton, Ohio",5/28/14,2014,5,28

"Too much management, not enough hard workers.","My time with Wal-Mart was horrible.

Working at Wal-Mart,"A typical (9 hour) shift starts by scanning my I.D. Badge to find out what register I'm assigned to until my first break, which I probably won't get. I sign into my register and start to check out customers. Hopefully I won't run out of change or need a price check, because the managers ignore your page half of the time. After my first break I go back and scan my badge to go to another register. This time I go to the self check. It's simple enough. Help up to six customers when needed. Scan your badge to verify age or to fix simple problems. Pray that the machines don't mess up. You'll have a hard time getting a manager to come help you! Thank goodness it's lunch time. I love that I get an entire hour to eat and relax. Back to work, scan your badge, go to a register, wait for my last break. 90% of the time, I will not get my last break. Finally, time to go home.

Sometimes it may not work and they still get a little hostile but the majority of the times, it makes the situation a lot easier to handle. As a Customer Service Manager I was supervisor over every cashier, responsible for every register in the store, responsible for register audits, supervision the customer service desk and money center, handle money gram transactions, vendor payments and loans up to 10,000 dollars plus.

You may be starting one manager's assignment, only to be directed by another manager's assignment. Some assignments pay differed from your own & I thought that was unfair.

Then check out customers for the rest of the day. When there are no customers we pick up items that are not supposed to be at the register. As well as cleaning our register. I learned better customer service skills. Management is usually productive, but at the same time they seem to pick favorites and don't treat everyone equally.

My management team is mostly very rude and thinks that one third of a crew you need can do as much as a normal sized crew. they are very disrespectful and don't care much about what we have to say. It's all about their numbers. The only manager i enjoy is my direct supervisor because he makes work a lot more enjoyable by having fun while working as fast if not faster then a majority of the people working.

fast pace,"Everyday you deal with customers and help them with what they need. You get to be a pro at fixing registers and counting money faster than you could imagine. All of the cashiers are great to work with but sometimes the management isn't so much great. But when it comes to helping someone with a family matter they will defiantly work with you on what you need. And they do recognize you on great work. I had customers all the time telling my higher managers how much I made their experience so much better, and that they would come back because of me. You develop relationships with customers cause there are always your casuals that do come in. But over all I say that it is a pretty good place to work but I wouldn't make it my permanent place of work. There is a lot of stress that can come along with it too cause you will come across certain people who will just kind of do their own thing and will not work well with you and put all of the duties on you. That is how I was, every once in a while they would pitch in and help but they never really offered it, or really seemed to try and work as a team, some of the staff seemed more as a defend for yourself type of group.

Truly slave labor for the desperate,"I have worked for several retailers before Walmart and found that this company in particular is more disorganized than all of them. The overall atmosphere among employees is very negative. The staff (not exclusive to hourly folks, mind you) works mostly by being motivated by threat of termination. While I imagine some stores function better than others I find that all former Walmart staff is largely in agreement about the fear tactics used by management._x000D__x000D_If you want to be promoted it is rarely going to happen through hard work and dedication. In fact, I find those of us who work hard are clearly held on a different standard in which our reward is being shipped to other stores in order to ""help fix them,"" as well as to be called in for overnight shifts (if you're daytime) or daytime shifts (if you're night time). Overall, the long term employees are the ones who know how to work the system, and take abuse._x000D__x000D_Additionally, I found that my difficulty in transferring between stores is not something isolated and while it is entirely up to a given store's management staff, I have been informed by many that most stores have a staff that will keep you because they find you to be a treasure to exploit, and incidentally I've also heard it is used to maliciously used to force unhappy less hard working people to stay where they are unhappy._x000D__x000D_My experience was so bad I not only won't work there again, I won't even shop there.",1,Former Employee,Merchandiser/Sales Associate ,"Visalia, CA",5/22/14,2014,5,22

There was the unfortunate matter of a high management turnover rate that cause some confusion among the sales associates regarding how things should be run. With each new manager, new employees would develop different ways of doing things that caused some conflict.

History of my career,There is both a positive and negative side with working at wal-mart. The positive is spending time helping customers and making them feel good about their shopping experience.

"Below average Management Team, Trashy Customers","Departments are constantly behind due to lazy, under paid, or under employed people. There are a handful of good managers, but most are condescending, unorganized, uneducated, and unethical, among other things. Same thing as far as customers, and they will try to start fights with the employees or lie just to get free stuff. Co workers are mostly nice people but are stressed out a lot which makes them grouchy.

Co-workers make it Fun but high-stress,"Okay, so I worked overnight and we told the new-hires their first night clocking on that if they can make it to day 90 then they will make it to year 20 since it will all start to blend together. The work WAS fun, but then they came up with the torture called the timing system where I would start stocking something in grocery with an impossible time limit and end up bounced to 4 departments by the end of the night. My reviews consistently were high except I was standard everywhere by not excellent anywhere. After my second month working there I noticed that employees were becoming more and more expendable to management and devoted myself to becoming very difficult to replace by being there and ready to learn every part of every department and never complaining about anything. I was successful, and often referred to as the ping-pong ball of the shift since I always would start one place, but worked cashier breaks, electronics and would end up in the backroom by shift end. My health started to decline due lack of time in the sun, excessive time under the fluorescent lights and high amount of cardboard dust so I finally decided to leave for the sake of my health. _x000D__x000D_I loved Wal-Mart and it was by far my favorite job, with lots of advancement potential, amazing pay, fun co-workers and two paid 15-minute breaks and an hour unpaid lunch mandatory every shift (never skip a break or lunch you will be penalized for it).

Simple mistakes can produce major problems. The most important lesson was how to actively listen and understand people. Most angry customers are not upset with the employees. If they feel that better service could have been delivered, then it should have been. Management was great. The Pharmacy manager is a very understanding and patient man. He was very flexible with my school schedule. All of my co-workers had no issue with teamwork. Everyone took the extra mile to help one another during the busiest days of the week.

Decent work place but confusing,"Working at Wal-Mart wasn't too bad. You go in, clock in, meet with your CSM (Customer Service Manager) to get your register assignment for the day, and then get right to work. Occasionally you are asked to fill a break for another department or a door greeter. You are also told when to go on break or lunch by your CSM or you may be asked to run clean up of items out of place. As a cashier, I filled a few roles, and not all of them on the front-line cash registers. It wasn't a bad place to work, but it was horribly confusing as to who was in charge of you above the CSMs. We had a few switches of managers on the front-line so it was hard to tell who you went to to go above the CSMs for any reason.

One member of management doesn't need to make a decision unless management higher than them is aware and agrees to the change. A typical days at work includes giving breaks, money and keeping up with and to all the front end associates. I make sure they have what they need when they need something. My past five years I have learned how to successfully manage a team and provide great customer service in a timely manner. My fellow coworkers are amazing they make my day great. I have very good standing relationships with all my immediate fellow associates. I love the fact that I can make my customers day just by being courteous and asking how they are and if they found everything they were looking for. I love that I can make a crying child in a register line or at the service desk happy just by saying something to them. I enjoy being the last face a person sees when they are leaving.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"LaGrange, GA",5/15/14,2014,5,15

I was able to get the hours I needed while I went to school and was appreciated for my hard work by all I worked with and did projects for.

Management was not the best. They are suppose to be a leader showing you what they want but at walmart they lacked that they never showed us leadership. What i disliked was that they wanted us to follow their rules which was not a big deal it was the whole fact of the management would break the rules that they wanted from their staff and mostly do it in front of staff.

A good job made bad by the poor atmosphere created by some of the mangagement.,"I did the job well enough to earn three raises in pay during the time that I worked there.  Long hours, but worth it as far as that goes.  However, in return for that they do not treat their employees well and were unnecessarily difficult.  There is no need to express a 'live in fear' attitude towards good people who did everything they were told and then some only to be fired or forced to quit (usually before their benefits kicked in).  Now again, I do not like to speak out of school -- I leave the past in the past -- but I do not like it when good people are treated unfairly.  You can not tell them that you need them one minute then threaten to fire them over the simplest thing the next.  There is no job security there and I would not recommend working there unless you have a backup plan.  I enjoyed working with about 90% of the people there.  My favorite part was dealing directly with customers, especially with those who had children, who would often times complement me on my willingness to put up with them.  Many customers who I dealt with on a daily basis would ask for my help -- knowing that I would not steer them wrong.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Summerville, SC",5/15/14,2014,5,15

Good place for high school students or older people needing a job.,"My experience at Walmart was mixed. A typical day consisted of me being confined to one or more cash registers  with about 6 inches of free space on all sides. I would spend all day standing. The customers were mostly friendly and cooperative, but there were a large number of difficult or rude customers that regularly visited. I learned how to operate a cash register, how to operate unsupervised in the cash office, how to identify items based on the barcode information, how to properly manage my time, and how to exhibit successful and professional customer service. Management was so-so, with some wise decisions being made and some poor decisions. My co-workers were mostly friendly and helpful, though employee turnover was fairly high and there were constantly new faces. The hardest part of the job was standing in one place all day long and being unable to freely move about, even to go to the bathroom or get a drink.

When I first started working there, the motto was, ""People first in everything we do"". By the time of my departure it was now the 4S's (Sales, Service, Save, Selection). Money became the number one goal and the workers became a lot more expendable. Promotions weren't considered based on knowledge, seniority or work ethic, but more on who you know and politics. There is very little work/life balance. They force new mothers to work the overnight shift, holidays were mandatory and we only received 1 comp day for working all those extra days during the holidays.

Typical day at Walmart,"A typical day at Walmart would be to clock in, walk to the front of the store, receive my drawer keys and hit the floor running._x000D_I would relieve the customer service manager on duty for her or his break. The process of doing this included having the change drawer signed over to me. I would then answer any requests from any cashiers and outlying registers and assist any customers needs.  When the service manager I relieved came back from break I would start my audits. If lines at the registers I would page for all register trained cashiers to come help. If no response I would contact a member of upper management asking them to walk the floor for cashier trained associates. I believe this was the hardest part of my job, _x000D__x000D_I did enjoy working with the cashier. I was able to get to know some of them as we talked and worked at the same time.",1,Former Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER ,"Wasilla, AK",5/13/14,2014,5,13
Most Dehumanizing Employment Experience Ever,"As a former Wal-Mart employee, I would not recommend working at Wal-Mart to anyone. Words cannot describe how hard I worked for them. I learned how to do things that I didn't have to do just to help out. I worked all over the store in almost every department, did everything I was asked to do and then some. But I was treated like I never did anything by management. The managers at this store were the most awful human beings to walk the planet and were complete idiots. My co-workers were lazy and incompetent. I had one co-worker (another sales associate, not a manager) who would bring me her work for me to do when I was at the fitting rooms. And the managers treated her like she was a hard worker and did everything by herself. There was nothing enjoyable about working here. The benefits were horrible. No two schedules were ever the same, so my internal clock was never right. Some times they would have me work until 12 am and then come back for a new shift at 7 am knowing full well that I lived almost an hour away. I never knew when to eat or sleep. The pay was abysmal. To be fair, when I started, my job was what I considered a minimum-wage job. All I was really responsible for was answering the phone and directing calls, processing returns, and letting people in the fitting rooms. But as time went on they kept giving me more and more responsibilities but never increasing my pay. By the time I quit, I was doing everything the department managers were responsible for doing but only being paid a few cents over minimum wage. Working at Wal-Mart was the worst experience of my life. - more...",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lafayette, TN",5/13/14,2014,5,13

Myself along with two of my closest coworkers have grown together and pushed each other  through the tough times, and for that I have grown so much as a person. The toughest part of my job is the under staffing of my store, because it makes myself along with my coworkers pick up the pieces. I have no problem with picking up what we lack in staffing with extra hard work, but I feel it takes away from the customer experience, and for me that is what retail is all about.

It was a job,"Wal-Mart is where you work when you need a job to pay bills, and it barely covers that if it does at all. Management can't seem to keep a consistent schedule or enforce rules and policies consistently. Advancement at the two stores I worked at worked more off of who you were friends with as apposed to how hard you worked.

I've learned tons of things from this job. One of the most helpful things I have learned is how to deal with both online and in-store customers. Customers can be extremely hard to deal with and I have to deal with all types on a daily basis. My co-workers are all team players and easy to work with and are always willing to help out when needed. The hardest part of my job is the customers! I say this only because I have to deal with the customers who come into the store with problems as well as those who call with problems with their online orders.

Very task oriented,"Wal Mart is very focused on the appearance of the store, and less so on the availability of Associates to assist customers. During the day our responsibilities included stocking the shelves, counting product of high value, and cleaning the department. Rarely do we assist customers. I am leaning quite a bit about inventory management which was a field i had very little experience in before now.The Management is always around, but seems to rarely interact with the actual sales associates. I may have spoken to my manager a handful of times in my stint here so far. Thus far into my life at Wal Mart i enjoy the company of some of my co-workers, however most of them seem just miserable, so its often times difficult to sift through the negative disposition they carry around. I went to Wal Mart to get a job. I expected to work, and since that is the case I really dont find any of my job ""hard"" or more than should be expected of me. I love talking to people, so the few times i get to help a happy customer, or turn a negative situation into a good experience, those are my favorite part of the job.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Wasilla, AK",5/9/14,2014,5,9

"Fun,","I am a closing Deli member and I very much ENJOY my work! I love the busy bustle of the closing shift, there are always things t do. This was my first food oriented job and I learned many things about the ovens, fryers and slicers: Nighty cleaning and maintaining of all the equipment used daily and food safety and regulations. I am left without managers through 90%-100% of my shifts and must make many decisions and time management choices daily. As I said I very much do enjoy this job, but I would say the hardest part is the lack of team work at times and the lack of assistance of the Salaried Management of the store.

After about an hour and a half I will get my first break ( 15 Min. ) then back to work I go. I will most likely get sent to another register to do a co-workers break/ lunch or it could be time for them to go home. If there are no customers then I am to zone my aisle and make sure everything is where it needs to be nice and neat. If we aren't very busy I would normally ask one of my csms if they have any work needed to be done or if I could go catch up on my CBL's. If that's the case I would go back to personnel and sit on the computer learning all the things they have changed over the last couple weeks or months, Then I would go to Lunch ( 1 Hour ). After I clocked back in from lunch the computer would send me to another register, but before I would go there I'd check with my Customer service manager they would send me to another register until my last break ( 15 Min ) .

Then we zone and find out notes of where and what we will be doing .  I have learned to be very adaptable in change of plans for the day. We all pull together to help each other.

This is Wal-Mart,"I worked in the Auto department, Hardware department, and Download/Truck Unloading department. Everything is mostly individualized except the backroom truck download teams. I liked the Hardware department better because I was able to talk to many customers and practice my customer service skills to be very helpful and people would take sales or walk in my department area for more assistance. I liked helping and would complete my department zoning and desk requirements before assisting others in their departments. I made friends in different departments and help zoning throughout the store. The management worked on Wal-Mart's own promotion ladder for checking off training and trying hard to get noticed, but even if they got their payouts, they would overlook the people that worked primarily the whole store. The workers in the departments and downloading trucks are hardworking ethical people. The management was run by those that only see money and overlook and overstep the department workers. Some supervisors were college students aching for attention, got it, but then they were ignorant and only cared about themselves and their duties so if they got done then that is what mattered to them, they did not care about their team because they want to go home._x000D__x000D_I cared about being a good morale support to those I worked with, even if they were supervisors.

Then when the baker is done baking and everyone goes home its your responsibility to make sure all freight was worked and brought into the bakery from the freezers, if any dishes are left behind make sure you wash them, sweep and mop floors, listen for customers in case they want to order a cake, use your friendliest customer service skills, if you see a customer within ten feet from you it is your responsibility to ask them ""Are you finding everything alright.""

"It's a busy/fun environment, but the hours are never concrete.",It's always busy in Wal-Mart.  There are tons of customers and co-workers in the store at any one time.  This makes it feel more lively.  The biggest problem with Wal-Mart is the fact that you don't get payed for what you actually have to do and the hours are all over the place crazy.  One day you may work from 6 P.M. to 10 P.M. and then the very next day you come in at 6 A.M.,3,Former Employee,cashier/sales associate/loader/unloader/sorting ,"Hohenwald, TN",5/2/14,2014,5,2

easy and fun meeting new people.,I was at Walmart for a very short period only 2 months and 2 weeks. I was temporary but the little time II did spend there I enjoyed it a lot. I loved the people I was around they felt like family. Everybody got along with each other and worked together to help each other if we could. I believe the hardest part of the job was so many customers come up to you every day every minute and while your off to help one customer another would stop u on your way to your destination. You have to try to figure out what the customer needs as soon as u can without being messy doing it and not  have them wait for long periods of time. I enjoyed helping the customers. I have gotten so many big smiles and hugs from customers. I was also offered a tip but I couldn't accept it that's against the rules. Another hard part of the job was getting fired.

In Oceanside on Vista way and Jefferson. Clueless and impersonal. Ambiance of entitlement an degradation of employees.,"Unbelievable. In an industry that is to communicate with people, store managers ironically degrade employees beneath their job title, seem to propel personal an irrelevant agendas, create impractical surplus of duties and do not appreciate employees of hard work. Customers would be disgusted at the reality of how employees are treated behind the consumer curtain at this establishment. _x000D__x000D_Its a show of exemplifying power and flexing authoritative muscle. Very counter productive and in my tenure, I noticed good upbeat workers and team playing, responsible associates driven to call it quits, including myself._x000D__x000D_The produce department is a young mans job indeed. Constant heavy lifting, and worse, every safe lifting method is violated due to the situation they place you in: small room with multiple person length pallets of produce with narrow lanes and elbowroom to maneuver heavy crates of produce, too many responsibility while always understaffed to save money, and a scapegoat for any failures created by managers decisions.

Generally most people start as Cashier which I did, but I then moved back to Electronics where I really enjoyed my work and knew a lot more about the products.

Past Employment,"I had worked for Walmart for six years, so when I finally got promoted to assistant manager I was excited. When I would first get to work I would plan my day and the tasks ahead. I would conduct meetings with my associates to delegate daily tasks. Throughout the day I would over see projects as well as tasks that had been given. I would work with the public and handle any requests or complaints they might have had. From this I have learned that there is such diversity on thought in our world. I learned that not only your customers but your associates think and act differently than everyone else. You must set back and observe body language, facial expressions, as well as tone of voice to see how to approach each individual in each situation. I believe the hardest part of the job is work/life balance. If you don't manage your time and responsibilities before you know it you have disrupted the balance. To be the best and most effective at your job you must maintain that work/life balance. The most enjoyable part of may job was working with and helping people.

Difficult place to work,"The job itself is simple, and in some cases, almost enjoyable. As a Deli Sales Associate, I was responsible for slicing meat and cheese, and cooking rotisserie chickens for customers. There was also cleaning, but it was mostly customer service. Co-workers usually were agreeable, and in some cases made the job more fun. The biggest problem with this job was corporate. They would send directions that would either not solve the problem or create a new one. We had to adhere to these directions without question, and when things inevitably went wrong, we took the fall. These were things that were obviously ill-considered, and yet we had no say in the matter. There was also difficult management. I realize there is one in every crowd, but it seemed like quite a few of the managers simply enjoyed having a slight amount of authority and abused it with impunity. Any attempts to report them, even discreetly, were met with aggressive revenge tactics that usually culminated in the associate's dismissal.",2,Former Employee,DELI SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Bangor, ME",5/1/14,2014,5,1

hardworking place with broken equipment,"A typical day as a cart pusher at my Walmart was dreadful, our Cart Machine was always broken, and i was usually the only one scheduled. The hardest pat of my job though was lunch time, usually right after i just got the carts full id have to leave knowing they'd be empty when i got back, management would blame me, and i would have to run to get carts in until i was exhausted and it repeated day after day. Management could have fixed the cart machine or scheduled one more worker and everything would have been better. i worked my hardest everyday though",3,Former Employee,Cart Associate ,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4/30/14,2014,4,30

Good for first time job experience,"Although I was not with the company too long I was around long enough to get the feel of the atmosphere. I enjoyed the experience and took in everything I could learn to better equip myself for the future. However, I would not recommend this to be a long-term job for anyone if they had the choice. The company made you feel very unimportant and didn't appreciate the hard work, quality, time and efforts of your duties. It is very fast paced. Corners were cut everywhere. From the time I started working in the company to the time I finished, I was working in a different area, doing a different job, at the pay and title of what I was originally hired. All employees were shuffled around like this. Working more demanding jobs at lower pay and cutting hours without notice.",2,Former Employee,Jewelry sales ,"Bethany, MO",4/30/14,2014,4,30
A very proactive place to work at and fun!,Working at walmart you learn how to really cope with different customers that come across you especially overnight! The customers really help you grow and show you how to handle several situations good and bad! The hardest part about working at walmart is making sure that everything is done a a paced manner but it can get easier after a while. The most enjoyable part about wirking overnight at walmart is that you have all kind of entertainment and there is no way that you can be sleepy until your shift is over of course!,5,Former Employee,CASHIER ,"Houston, Tx",4/30/14,2014,4,30

Strange Dichotomy of Job Security and Advancement,"In my year as a Walmart associate, I was promoted once and given a raise three times, which I though to be impressive in the relatively short amount of time I worked there. My work was relatively straightforward and I was given plenty of training and I was treated as an equal, even by my direct superiors._x000D__x000D_However, some of the corporate policies can be seemingly unforgiving to the less fortunate. Particularly Walmart's attendance policy. While Walmart can have good opportunities for advancement, if a person doesn't expect to have more than 4-6 absences in a year (be it due to personal illness or some other unforeseen circumstance) its unlikely that a person will be employed for much longer than that. While illness can be an excusable absence, it must be approved via a doctor's note AND an approved Leave of Absence. Which, by the way, is a process that has been outsourced to another company and takes roughly a week to complete. Until those requirements are met, all ""illness"" related absences are considered unexcused.",3,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate / Deli Associate ,"Oswego, NY",4/30/14,2014,4,30
My experience,"I can only speak from my experience at the Walmart where I worked. The some coworkers were great. The management was horrible. We were taught about the ten foot rule. The only time the managers used it was when they were with visitors from other stores and home office. They had their favorites. The coworkers that the management favored would do little or nothing while everyone else had to work harder. They say there is an open door policy. I don't know about that being through. You have to chase the managers down to ask them for anything. They would not work with anyone with scheduling issues. I had to stop going to school just to keep my job. That may seem like a choice of my own. At that time, I greatly needed the job. If I had known how it was at that Walmart, I would have never stopped going to school.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Batesville, MS",4/30/14,2014,4,30

A typical receiving position with positive coworkers and vendors.,My day starts with signing out the keys that open up the backdoor and loading dock doors.  After that I prepare my desk and paperwork for the day.  That's about when the vendors start showing up.  I open the door for them and match up their invoice with the total on the Telzon after I scan in the product.  Many vendors come through the door so I do a lot of multitasking throughout the day.  At the end of the day I match up all of our printed invoices with the invoices I get from the vendors and hand them to the accounting office.  This is how all the companies will get paid.  Management typically gives minimal supervision because me and the other receiver have a good handle on keeping the vendors in compliance with all store policies.  I enjoy the relationship I have with all the vendors and they respect me enough to listen to what I tell them.,3,Current Employee,Receiving Clerk ,"Raynham, MA",4/29/14,2014,4,29

Productive non-stop work place,"A typical day was a 10hr day of loading trailers with 2 20min breaks and 1 30min lunch break.  I learned how to properly load a good quality trailer so as nothing would break on transportation to the stores.  Some management was good and helpful.  1 was not.

I also dealt with thousands of dollars and was responsible for counting and closing over 15 registers a night in under 20 minutes. I've learned to have patience and understanding being a Customer Service Manager since you're that go to person. The cashiers and management staff played monumental roles in helping achieve store goals. Crowd control was a small issue. Lines would grow so long that every member of the store would have to jump on register. That may have actually been the best part of the job because of the satisfaction you received after the rush slowed down.,5,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Valley Stream, NY",4/29/14,2014,4,29

I learned many things including customer service and their return kiosks, how to use a register, cart pushing and the motorized cart pushers they use, how to properly give fish in the pet dept., and how to help people in electronics by getting them locked up movies or games.

Horrible dead-end job,"Worked for Wal-mart for 6 years. Amazingly  no promotion. Wal-mart promotes YOUNG workers who  have no job skills because of the high turn-over rate, thinking these are the ones who will stay the longest. Wal-mart wasn't always a bad place to work. They are in a five year plan of increasing sales while decreasing the workforce. Unfortunately the plan has backfired as there is little help to stock shelves, clean, run cash registers, etc., all in the name of the ""bottom line"", to keep the stockholders happy. So, each time a full-time worker leaves or is fired, he/she is replaced with a part-timer or temp worker.  There is no incentive for workers to do a good job anymore, as there is no sense of appreciation for a job well done, no recognition from management ( not even a ""thank you"").  Sadly this enormous company is becoming a joke to work for.",1,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"N Smithfield, RI",4/28/14,2014,4,28

Management from the shift before often left work from the previous shift for us to complete, as well as having one shift manager tell us to do one thing and another telling us to do something else. Co-workers were all young men stuck in an non-advancing low-paying position because it's better than not being able to pay bills.

Decent place for a part time job.,"On a typical I stock items, answer customer questions, and work with inventory management. Occasionally I will work as a cashier. Working here I've learned inventory management and time management skills. Management turns over too quickly to be consistent. Most will help if you have a problem and they tend to give reasonable tasks. My coworkers are a bit gossipy and tend to complain a lot. Turnover is predictably high so there are constantly a large group of new faces. The hardest part of the job is staying interested in my work. Most of what I do seems kind of pointless in the grand scheme of life. The most enjoyable part of my job is the conversations I have with a few of my coworkers, and working with my current department manager.

Very fast paced environment everyday.,"Wal-Mart is a great company to work with for a season and learn the foundation of a successful retail business.  I perfected my customer service skills here, learned the importance of inventory management and turnover, and I grew in my administrative skills.  A typical work day really depends on how the day and night before went.  If there was a lot of freight left over, the goal would be to work through that.  If there are price changes in the system, that is not to be neglected.  My departments must be toured daily and if not up to par, addressed with diligence and timeliness which include zoning, out-of-stocks, missing labels, and modular integrity.  Management often had a communication lag and each one gave their own tasks assignments which meant there were more things to be done than possible to complete in a given work day most of the time.  I had the store manager, co-manager, and two assistant managers to answer to almost everyday.  There were some who were more informative who helped decipher priority of assignments for the store in that day when we are taken out of our normal routines for the day.  Some co-workers cared, most did not but I believe a great management team makes a difference in that area.  The hardest part of the job was being able to complete ALL the assignments each day in excellence with outrageous and machine-like deadlines.  What I did enjoy was impacting other associates lives and even the customers in positive ways and seeing smiles returned back to me when it was done.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager of Impulse Buys and Candy ,"Norfolk, VA",4/26/14,2014,4,26

work place with alot of interesting people,"As a 2year associate I have seen constant and drastic changes within my company. Benifits? Yes. Some really good and some not so good. Excellent Dental and very reasonable, Health insurance? Hard to touch financially. Beside with the comepany becoming mostly part-time, with a two year wait on medical insurance pretty out of reach. We are given sick time but, do not use it unless you schedule it in three weeks in advance. All absences count. Doctors notes don't mean a thing. 6 absences in a rolling 6 month period. NO MATTER what! Walmart has become very short term. part time employment. 75% of my co-workers get food stamps, medicaid or some other kind of assistance. Walmart expects total availability. 7 days per week.There ""OPEN DOOR""  policy sometimes work dependinf on who your managers are, ive seen some people use it and don't come back the next day. They call it ""OPEN AVAILABILITY"". So, don't plan on it as a second job. You will not get enough hours to support a family with out assistance. You might work 7am-4pm one day and 5pm-11pm the next. Turn around and be back first thing the next morning. Very hard to plan life around. They do schedule out 3 weeks but, forget flexability. Very disposable enviroment. Difficult to walk into work each day wondering if it is your last. Many get away with practically murder and others get raked over the coals for not breathing right.

A hardworking day meeting new people.,"A typical day at work includes, clocking in. After I would clock in a would scan my badge and it will tell me which station to go to. This can include relieving someone for a break or opening my own cash register. After I go to my station, I would put in my employee register number and turn on my light so customers know that my station is open. Before I begin wit the first customer, I ask my manager to key in a ""no-sale"" on my register to make sure I have enough change for the time that I am on that register. My co-workers and I work together to get through customers fairly quick by offering to take customers out of my line to minimize customers wait time. Also if we need higher management to complete a sale we can ask our co-workers to look out for them or go find one. The hardest part of the job to me is remembering the produce numbers. It is not required of me but it speeds up the process instead of having to look up the produce numbers on the bulletin. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and realizing that there are many different kinds of people in the world and just to hear them talking about there lives shows me that they trust me with there information and that I make them feel comfortable enough for them to hold a conversation with me. At the end of the day, I ask my managers do they need any further help, or do they need me to stay any longer. If not then I clock out and leave for the night.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Cleveland, TN",4/22/14,2014,4,22

They gave us a gallon of water with grass and bugs in it and wanted us to drink it if we got thristy from being out in the heat.

Fast paced workplace with breakroom,"As a department manager my typical day was always filled with much to do (scanning outs, working and binning left over freight, cleaning up leftover cardboard, etc.). I learned a lot about retail in the time I worked there. As far as backroom and sales floor processes, and how to properly stock and maintain a store so customers can find what they need, and safely do so. The management seems to have communication issues from time to time, as well as not always treat all associates and customers they way a manager should. I did however make some good friends out of working there with fellow associates and managers alike. As with any workplace of course the proper treatment varied. Overall I enjoyed working there overall, but the quality of the store I worked for seems to be dipping year by year. Within 3 years more than a handful of managers had either quit, or transfered to another store due to lack of communication and respect from there supervisors. Its a great place to work if you find your particular area in the store you enjoy, and you have a good sense of patience and understanding of the effect stress and a large workload can have on a manager of such a large retail store. Great job security, and great benefits if you stick with the company.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Tyler, TX",4/13/14,2014,4,13

I'm the type of person that if I work somewhere I want to know every question there is to answer.  I learned courteous gestures. cashier, inventory and customer service. I found it fun directing customers to the best product of its type, the best times would be working side by side by a manger when they have to make a attraction for a session/holiday, they called it making displays. my best moment  working there was on black Friday I had a  microphone and was on a tall latter outside talking to the crowd.  The  hardest part of my job was when they needed someone to work overnight for a couple weeks. putting out all the products making sure they where priced right and in the right spot and on a timer.

Language doesn't seem to be an issue between co-workers who work in your same department as everyone knows their responsibility and what needs to be done.  The hardest part though was getting rid of the expired products, mostly because each item needs to be disposed of in very specific ways as the store has many different vendors and each with a diverse ways on how to handle their products.
