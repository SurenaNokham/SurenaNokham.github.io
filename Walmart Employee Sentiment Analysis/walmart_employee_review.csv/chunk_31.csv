Work,I enjoyed my job always knew what I had to do before I even came in the door .very cold most days yes everyday the people were very nice but it is a busy job you have to fill your pallets and get them loadedmust be a fast worker at the same time must be a causious worker avoiding any incidents to a sure production goes on .All in all a good job,4,Former Employee,Loader/Unloader ,"Opelika, AL",1/19/17,2017,1,19
Depending on store,"Depending on the store you are hired in and if the manger is great like Jacksonville, NC was then you can move up and go long way in company.

Upper Management are failing,"We all know what this company fails at. Their grocery side is in need of better direction. Customer service is bad, pay is terrible and control in the stores is bad. They hire anybody, that's the problem. they don't train these people the way they should.

An ok work place,"Management is not fair in how they handle there employees, they have their favorites and are not ashamed to admit or show it. The job it self is not hard, can be overwhelming to start if you don't know where everything is located on the shelf. But once you are there for a while you just kind of get the hand of things. only real complaint is that the attendance policy is not enforced as it should be, some employees are late consistently with out any warnings or occurrences appearing on there account.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Fresh Associate ,"Warrensburg, MO",1/19/17,2017,1,19

some flaws,"A typical day at Wal-Mart for me from my perspective, Is very calming to a certain point until you have the one person who cant stand you the most come and ruin your day{Assistant Manager Paul}. If I learned anything in my 1 year and some months working in retail or fast food is that I'm ready to start a new career where I can very well excel in my field. I have been certified to operate an electric forklift and electric pallet jack. My co-works are awesome, they are the reason work is work we make each other strive to do better in Wal-Mart. Teamwork is a big BIG deal while working for Wal-Mart. Wow I'm everywhere with this I skipped Management, Well I was told plenty of times as I tried to give an opinion in Wal-Mart to management, that unless I am"" A Manager Than My Opinion Should Not Be Given Until/After A Task Is Done"" In a work place I believe that no matter what your position is you still have the right to voice your opinion as long as it's about work or about defending your situation about something you were wrongly accused of. But management it the only Flaw in Wal-Mart.. I believe truly that Wal-Mart does not have a hard part about the job because no matter what you have to do if you dont get it than you always have an extra team member to help you through your task or even your day. The most enjoyable part of the day most would say going home, I love knowing that I got through the day with all my work complete and at least Satisfying almost 25 customers everyday on an 8 hr shift..",4,Current Employee,Customer service and satisfaction ,"Washington, DC",1/18/17,2017,1,18

Interesting,"The last position I worked at Wal-Mart was Asset Protection. In that line of work you never knew how your day was going to go because there was always something going on either shoplifters, video review for stolen credit cards, to accidents that may had happen within the store. Also I would review video on customers and associates to make sure everything would go right while an asset protection associate was not there, I also attend in Court proceeding. So the typical day at Wal-Mart for an Asset Protection person was very entertaining and interesting. I got along with all my fellow workers,management, and local Police Department. I would consider myself well liked within the company.",4,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Semmes, AL",1/18/17,2017,1,18

You only get 3 days off (3 credits) every 6 months no matter what illness, weather, or emergency. Management may show you little respect if you are at a busy Walmart. However, there are Walmarts with pleasant worker and customers. Is it a terrible down town Walmart or a peaceful one in the country?

Good environment but poor retention,These guys since they were bought by WalMart try to hire people in for the least possible amount and then find reasons to let people that make too much money need to be let go.

"Super easy work environment, but it does get boring and slow where I was.","I would show up, clock in, go to my register, check the drawer and money,make sure I had what I needed at my register. Turn my light on, and go ""red line"" looking for customers to get through my aisle. After waiting for a while we would zone our aisle, and the areas near our register. We would also stock shelves, and help other cashiers checking out customers by bagging for them, or running codes for them. Working there I learned a lot of customer service, dealing with issues and just talking to people in general making them feel welcomed. I also learned time management, and working with a quickness, when you all have 7 customers in your line and its only building up you have to move quick, and when your going to get off in 5 minutes and you have people with full carts walking up, you have to know how many you can take and when to turn your light out. My co-workers were all great! we had a very fun, super friendly, hard working group. The hardest part of this job was, staying busy, in a smaller slower store your run out of things to do. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people, the people I worked with and the customers were always.

Management needs improvements as far as communication and following through with promises. I have made life long friends with many of the co-workers and refer to most of them as family. I learned patience, professionalism, and many more lessons. The hardest part of my job is being a manager over multiple areas of the store when it shouldn't be my responsibility.

Management was constantly pulling me away from my duties to reprimand me for things that absolutely did not matter and did not pertain to my duties (most common was leaving the register with the light turned on), even so far as to reprimand me for being in trouble too often, which was their doing, not mine.

A great place to work if you desire to learn how to work through high volumes of stress,"The Walmart corporation treats their associates fairly and truly strive towards building careers for their associates. At store level, this tends to fall flat. From my personal experience, management teams' concerns tend to focus only on sales and they overlook the smaller, but important details, until visitors from corporate office show concern. This causes high levels of stress within the management team which leads them to over-working associates and punishing those who fail to keep up. Associate and Supervisor concerns tend to get brushed off until deadlines come around.

I was trained a lot in a variety of different environments. There wasn't really a hard part of the job unless we were under a few techs and the shop was being over whelmed but nothing we couldn't handle. Loved my supervisors.

Normal Day,I always started work early I would start by walking the produce department to see what needed to be done usually would start with stocking or cleaning the backroom a little to make future work easier. If they were short in other departments would go help out there otherwise would stay in produce and stock and help customers. after lunch would keep work up till had to take throw outs to the back when I got back from that would start cleaning the department for the next day of work.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Springville NY,1/16/17,2017,1,16

Review for Walmart,"Working at Walmart was definitely a great opportunity and experiences. I was looked at for a lot of different positions throughout the company. I did not have anyone ""riding my back"" because they knew that I knew how to do my job and did not need any guidance. The hardest part of my job was having to explain to customer why the policy was the way it was. It was never hard to give a customer a firm NO but having to explain why they are getting the no and explain why they are hearing it. But, it made my day a lot better knowing that I brightened others day by doing a great job, being friendly and energetic and just being myself. A lot of customers knew me be name , not just by looking at my name tag;.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Fayetteville, NC",1/16/17,2017,1,16

Abusive work,"Regardless of your day, there is always a negative and disgruntled and upset customer to show up to say your hard work was unsatisfactory and claim you gave them an attitude. The reason why is because of management abusing there authority by slave driving there associates and when work is done they bever hesitate to push more work on you.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Redlands, CA",1/16/17,2017,1,16
great way to meet new people,A great experience and way to come up in the company fast if you pay attention and learn from the other employees.I was taught before I left how to run the customer service desk and do returns that was a great experience.,5,Former Employee,Cashier/ stock ,"Mullins, SC",1/16/17,2017,1,16
Kept track of all products coming in and leavng the store.,"A typical day at work included clocking in and starting out slow. Getting picks for what was left from overnight and then at 11 am starting on the picks for the day. I went to lunch around 12 for an hour. Coming back and getting the 2nd wave of picks that dropped at 2, and then going home at 4. I learned a lot about organization and how to set up products within the system. I also learned how to manage and keep track of the stores items. Management to me was the worst part. Some of the managers were rude and didn't seem to care about the employees. Just didn't care to act like a friend. Now however. some of the managers were pretty cool. My co-workers were one of the best parts about working there. We were like a family and they were just fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was that we would do pointless stuff, rather than doing what was necessary first. The best part to me was getting to interact with customers.",4,Former Employee,Inventory Manager ,"Monticello, AR",1/16/17,2017,1,16

Never a dull day,"Every day was unique at Walmart. Some days I would be scheduled as a cashier all day, others I would be bobbing and weaving between getting people checked out, helping push carts outside, and assisting a customer with a carry-out. There were definitely some very hard working individuals there - as well as a few slackers mixed in. Relative to the administration; they worked fairly well with me, as I had another job around which they scheduled me. Very understanding of them, as many employers turn their nose up at such things. All in all, I am better for the experience. Learned a lot about retail, about how to handle a wide variety of customers, and about my boundaries as an employee.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Statesville, NC",1/16/17,2017,1,16
Great Experience; Wonderful Team!,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. It was an amazing short time I had there but luckily, I got to be a part of a team that cared for their customers and satisfaction. There was so many new faces yet most of them seemed to already know me and get comfortable working with me as I set up or maintained their cellphones. Occasionally, there would be wait times while getting through to other representatives but we made the job fun as we were on hold. I would definitely like to have co-workers and management as great as them in any other business. There was honestly no hard part to the job, just simple learning and understand of each and every cellphone process. I enjoyed everything this job had to offer me!",4,Former Employee,Wireless Sales Associate ,"Willmar, MN",1/16/17,2017,1,16
Lots of opportunity,"I liked working for Walmart because I met a lot of wonderful people.

I managed to get my work done but it wasn't easy.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager for Cosmetics. ,"Lakewood, CO",1/16/17,2017,1,16

Wal-Mart,"A typical day at work at Wal-Mart would be clocking in going to the back take pallets out that needed to be taken out, or stocking shelf's while waiting for the truck to come in so I can unload it. When the truck gets there I would unload the truck to my co-workers, after the truck was done we would each grab a pallet and take it out and make sure we put it where it should go. While worker in the back I learned how to build pallets, I got along with my co-workers, and management very well.

Controversial work environment,Walmart in my opinion is micro-managed and unorganized. The rules and expectations change from manager to manager. The pay rate is exceptionally poor for the ever increasing work load placed on associates. The training is done mostly hands on but begins with a tiresome extensive online orientation. All of my daily tasks are fairly simple minded. My co-workers are friendly but inconsistent.

A Great Company to Work for with Good Co-Workers,I have only been working for Walmart a little over five months in the meat department and thus far its been great working there. When something comes up personally management work around your schedule so you may attend. There is no hard part in my job because I really love what I'm doing.

Great Place To work 6 Months At a Time,A typical day at work starts with a scrum or kanban meeting to determine what the days activities or hurdles are.  Most of the development efforts a off-shore.  Walmart has many diverse skillsets and is in transition to a real time environment from batch processing.  Management is driven to remove itself from mainframe processing.  Another part of the companies culture has become reductions in force that are occurring every 6 months. This is due to the changing atmosphere within the retail sector.  This is a great environment for newer platform and methodologies.  Not so great for older platforms.,5,Current Employee,Systems Analyst ,Walmart Technilogy,1/15/17,2017,1,15

Good Entry Level Retail Job,"A typical day at work would consist of coming into work talking to my manager for about 10 minutes and getting my day started. I stocked shelves, conducted inventory, greeted and assisted customers. The management is ok.  You have managers that work really hard and other managers that do not do as much. I had an awesome Manager that helped me and was very knowledgeable. Beside the store manager, my manager was great. I can not speak for every manager that works there, but like I said I had an awesome department manager. My co-workers were amazing as well. I experienced some ups and downs at times with co-workers, but everyone knows what they are there for and this is a team effort to help the department. The hardest part about the job is job enrichment and enlargement. After a while the job gets repetitive and there is absolutely little room for advancement. The compensation and benefits are ok for young adults. Management can be a bit useless and a nuisance at times. Managers are not on the same page and you have a lot of miscommunication. I actually had the opportunity to enjoy the good and bad side of entry level retail work. You learn about sales, marketing, how to use the SMART system for inventory. I learned a lot from this company.

The nights are sometimes unpredictable, sometimes we were busy, sometimes not, and sometimes the break times change for each person (as well as when the bathroom is closed for cleaning).  The other people there were nice, though the managers need to keep a closer eye out for safety violations.  The site has a commissary for dinner, which has nice food, but they really need to restock the silverware more often.  Also, break is twenty minutes getting there and back for a job that you'll spend seven and a half hours (at least) on your feet.

"Everyday there is something going on good/bad, never a dull day","The customers tend to call you horrible names and make fun of any sort of disability; however the managers doors are always open weather you have to vent or cry. I enjoy the openness that the managers have with the employees; we may not always like what they have to say but it's always to just help and improve yourself as an employee/ person. The hardest part of the job is honestly dealing with the name calling from customers and having to wait for a CSM to come and help (Depending on the time and day). I have learned that even if people are at their rudest, they come back again and again because you handled the situation; and did the appropriate actions when it got out of hand. Pretty much your typical day will start with clocking in at the time punch, and you head to your post (or department) and go down your list of things that need to be done (depending on what time you're working). If you're working over 6 hours you get two 15 minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch. You answer questions, and call a CSM for complaints that you can't handle or you personally feel the customer was wronged. You then finish up your day with either leaving your post (or department), or wait for the next shift to come and take over and clock out.",3,Current Employee,Crew Member ,"Watertown, WI",1/12/17,2017,1,12

My co-workers never seemed to interested in their job as they slacked off but were kind. Management gave us safety pins in hopes that Walmart employees would inform customers of 'Walmart credit cards'; managers would take away safety pin if they caught you not asking customers (employee punishment).

A typical day at work,"As an APA (Asset Protection Associate) I come into work, find the highest member of management to check in and see what focuses we have for the day. Next I walk the floor to see if the high dollar merchandise is secured and that we have coverage throughout the day. Once those tasks are completed I typically walk the store, looking for apprehensions. After I have one or two, I'll let the manager in charge know what took place and have them watch the video before finishing the documentation. Lastly, I'll end my day sending out emails to other Asset Protection teams in our market to keep them updated on any findings at our store (usually new ways of theft).",5,Former Employee,ELECTRONICS SUPPORT/ASSET PROTECTION ASSOCIATE ,"Brandon, FL",1/11/17,2017,1,11

Interesting work place,"Depends on what store you work at I guess. It's really not a fun place to work at. Management does not care if you're sick. Management is mean and nasty. It used to be a great place to work, but ever since the new store manager came in, it's all about being clean more than anything. No focus on being in stock, never have enough help on the salesfloor, or in the front end. It's just awful. I used to love working for Walmart, but it's no longer a great place to work.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"San Diego, CA",1/11/17,2017,1,11

"Productive, strict, and good work.",Scanning items and stocking them on the floor. Management was set up very nicely. I learned how to properly lift heavy boxes. Co-workers were nice. The hardest was going up the ladder and getting boxes down. The most enjoyable was putting the stock up where it goes.,4,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Lincolnton, NC",1/11/17,2017,1,11
"Good for Advancement, Poor Attitude","What is positive about Walmart is they do have jobs available and they can get you in there, but keep in mind that your level of education directly affects whether or not you'll be placed higher in the company than a stocker or cashier. In addition, choosing to work at Walmart Neighborhood Markets is better than Supercenters, because they do not have as many employees which creates the need for learning multiple jobs that improves your skills quickly allowing for advancement opportunities. The downside of this is the over-dependency on great associates. Just a warning: the job culture portrayed in orientation videos and found elsewhere is not reality, and often you will not find the support you need from your management team regarding work struggles. True good management attitude (not faked) is hard to find, and it directly effects whether or not you will enjoy your working experience. When working here, you need to be careful to obey compliance and be dependable, because lack of these things will easily lead to termination. Good things is higher pay $10-$15/hour, 10% discount on Walmart purchases excluding food items except during December, and full-time health and etc benefits options (deducted from paycheck).",3,Current Employee,MRA ,Florida,1/11/17,2017,1,11

Managment is a real issue.,"At the Wal-Mart I worked at, there were multiple managers on my shift that would give you multiple tasks and did not communicate well with each other. One would tell you to do one thing that would be completely different for what another manager wanted. They did not follow their company policy. One thing I was told during orientation was that management could not force you to cut your time to prevent overtime; but that is what my managers did. Even if it was one minute overtime, they would make you cut your time or write you up for not doing so...even if they asked you stay extra to help out. They also put too much expectations on single individuals...something that ultimately led to my own termination...was not being able to meet their rather high and ridiculous expectations in working multiple departments alone in a timely manner while getting called off to assist in other departments multiple times throughout my shift._x000D_Even at other stores. I am in current need of a job and have been trying to get in touch with a manager at a closer store that is in need of more associates. The manager had talked with me and even looked at my application and said that they would have to give it to those hiring (in the back of the store). Over the next two months, I had called for the manager or went to the store personally to talk with that manager at least 20 times, leaving my name and number to call back so I could get any information about my current application standings and never got any call backs. Even if they have no intentions of hiring me, I would still like to, at least, have - more...",2,Former Employee,Overnight Sales Associate/Stocker ,"New Bern, NC",1/10/17,2017,1,10

Decent if your young,"I worked overnights for about a year and a half. On a typical day we would be required to pick up after previous crews and still expected to complete our stuff on time. The overnight crew at our store was leaned on heavily by the rest of the store and most day-time hourly associates didn't even realize how much pressure was put on the - for the most part - understaffed crew. Management was good to me and whoever was pushing themselves and getting a workout in. For the most part every person the overnight crew besides a select few acted like freshmen in high school and spent their breaks gossiping about others. The thing I love most about the job was just being able to get a work out in while getting paid. Honestly for me the hardest part of the job was trying to stay out of the way of the grown children who spent more time gossiping then working. My advice is, this is a good job to get if you can work hard and ignore others.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Central Square, NY",1/10/17,2017,1,10

"Decent Work, Unreasonable expectations from both upper management and employees","My work here was short as a summer positions between semesters. I had little to no problem with the work, but the general store manager was infamous among the employees for having both unreasonable expectations and clearing out the former and effective management and providing inadequate replacement. This view is true to a point, but it remains largely egocentric and ignores the issues confronted by management. For instance, one of the chronic issues faced by management was having scheduled employees fail to show up on Friday and especially Saturday nights. However, on one such instance (isolated and abnormal for absentees), one more elderly individual than myself, had their spouse terribly sick in hospital and this individual was fired for wanting to be with their spouse. This was a case of no good option, but I believe that this was an extenuating circumstance that should have been worked through on both sides. On the other hand, I had many circumstances where my official training was told to be ignored and instead, new rules were created. For instance, during the remodel and inventory that followed shortly there after, heavy nights came an it was expected that if completion was not expected, breaks were to be skipped and lunches were to be shortened. Some of this was my own, internal need to complete the assignment I was given, but at others, it was stated by management. Efficiency goals are admirable, but not at the expense of the worker. In short, the employee is an afterthought for Walmart, but as long as you have that expectation, coping is possible.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Baraboo, WI",1/9/17,2017,1,9

I love my co-workers we are like a family and we work together to see to it that the company is successful.

Every day there seemed to be something else that was something new to be learned.

What i learned  at Walmart is the customer is always right .The management  at Walmart is very good they stay on you and if you do not  understand your task you can always ask and they will kindly explain it. My co-workers where OK i didn't really talk to them i stayed to myself.The hardest part of the job is when  the holidays was coming up so we had inventory so we had to make sure everything was in order so the managers where a little more on top of you.

Challenging and Hardwork,"Stocking at Walmart is very fast paced, but enjoyable.  Its interesting what you can find while putting product on the shelves. It also expands your knowledge of the products' locations, and information if you see one that you're curious about or need and buy it for yourself.  Its the perfect way to advertise to employees if you think about it that way, but that just makes up selling easier and it adds ingenuity to the way that employees add the personal experience to help influence a customer's decision to make a purchase.

Very easy non-thinking job,"It's a very easy job but is very fast paced at the same time.  So you have to constantly be moving and packing those packages.  Everything is computerized, so you just pack and send the package on it's way.  I've never worked in this type of atmosphere before and I actually like it!  _x000D__x000D_Breaks, ugh. you get 2 breaks per day as well as a 30 min lunch break, but you have to include your walk to 2 of 2 break rooms or to the outside, which is like 1/4 of a mile from the packing area and there's a ton of employees.  It's like being in a mall during Christmas time.  Then you have to wait at the time clock to punch out and back in.  That cuts out a few minutes of your break.  Personally, I think a 40-45 min lunch would suffice!  As well, the break(s) should be 30 min long (to include walk time)._x000D__x000D_You WILL lose weight working here and it TOTALLY ROCKS!  So Holla for that!!!  Then ""peak"" season will be over and you'll get fat again....._x000D__x000D_Over all, it's a very easy job, less drama (good thing) and a 4 day work week!

Walmart Secrets,"Walmart, for the most part, is a great company to work for. The issues that arise stem from upper management, starting with the store manager. When your management team isn't on the same page and/or doesn't follow store policies, it makes for difficult and confusing work days. What's worse than this is the fact that because the associates need their job to support their family, no one is brave enough to go to higher management and present them with the store issues.",4,Current Employee,CSM Customer Service Manager ,Nebraska,1/5/17,2017,1,5

Tough Work,"Work days consist of unloading trucks, moving freight, and stocking the sales floor at the bare minimum. Nothing too hard if you actually work and move with a purpose.

Decent place to work,"Overall, a decent place to work. Some of the managers are a bit pushy and angry all the time, but most of them are fairly friendly and willing to help. The co-workers are very helpful and friendly, willing to do anything that you need them to do to help you in your job. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with how busy the store gets at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with many different people everyday, in different situations.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Branson, MO",1/5/17,2017,1,5
I enjoyed my job had some friendly people,"I was a cashier at Walmart I would cash people out, return items to the correct departments cart that customers decided they didn't want.

I enjoyed being a cashier and meeting all kinds of different people.",5,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Niagara Falls, NY",1/5/17,2017,1,5
Worst job Ive ever worked at!,"When you hear Walmart the first thing you think of is long lines and rude customers! You haven't seen anything until you have to work behind the cash register. I had to deal with disrespectful people on a daily and ended up in a back brace after the first couple weeks due to the strain of heavy lifting, and hard work put on my body!

equal pro and cons,"A typical day at Wal-Mart starts with walking in the door, proceeding to the time clock and admitting to yourself that you are officially there. Then the procedure begins with walking to the customer service desk and signing off slips for recently returned merchandise, verifying proper procedures and guidelines have been followed and that all is well, at the moment, for the customer service associate(s). Proceeding on, the Customer Service Supervisor podium needs reviewed and balanced to maintain cash flow in and out of the registers. A constant total must be maintained within the podium to produce needed small or large change when needed. Next steps involve reviewing staffing and break/lunch positions, reviewing if any one needs to be going anywhere other than remaining stationary at their register, if any additional help is needed from the sales floor to maintain decent customer to cashier ratios and keep customers steadily flowing through the checkout lines at an acceptable pace. This above all is the focus of the CSS position - always maintaining adequate opened registers to allow maximum efficiency of customer traffic and the HIGHEST level of customer service possible. To BE the best, the friendliest, fastest checkout in the market, that is your goal.",3,Former Employee,Assets Protection Specialist ,"Covington, WA",1/4/17,2017,1,4

Productive fun environment,"Walmart is a nice place to work. Your job title and shift determines your hours, mostly. The managers are sometimes willing to put the blame on their workers instead of taking responsibility. They aren't very accommodating or understanding of problems going on in your personal life, even though you inform them before you are even hired. If you have the fortune of working under a generous support manager than working at Walmart can be fun and productive.",3,Former Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Valdosta, GA",1/4/17,2017,1,4

not fun,The day started out with a little meeting with the managers telling us our locations for the night. We then grabbed some scanners (that would help us find the location of products) and headed out to our aisle that we were assigned. Once done with that we went to the nearest manager to ask for our next assigned location. We then went to that location and started to restock that location. Breaks were every 2 and a half hours and were 15 minutes long. Lunch was 30 minutes long. Management was pretty poor. Super strict on breaks. The best part was the co-workers. I looked forward to seeing most of the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being constantly watched by the managers.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Saratoga Springs, UT",1/4/17,2017,1,4

Fast-paced and Interactive Environment,"Walmart was a great starting job for someone with no prior work experience. The co-workers were all friendly and relatable, making becoming a part of the Walmart family an easy transition. The management were kind, understanding, and approachable for anytime you have questions or requests. Everyday, one comes in to open a line or take over for another associate. General responsibilities were to make sure your workplace was clean and to make sure that customers were served in a timely, polite, and friendly manor. Any problems or questions that you cannot answer, you call a supervisor for help and then they will take over. You are given one hour for lunch and two 15 minute breaks throughout the day. The hardest part of the job will be trying to keep the customer content at all points during the transaction. The most enjoyable part will be when you have time to converse with your co-workers and managers, and meeting the various people you serve. What I took away from Walmart was learning to work quickly and efficiently while still being social with customers, be apart of a team-based environment where co-workers help each other with satisfying customer requests, and to be able to answer customer's concerns with accurate information so the managers and supervisors would have more time to attend to other responsibilities.",4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Waterford, CT",1/4/17,2017,1,4
Somedays You Get Headaches,A typical day at Walmart can be stress free majority of the time.  I was cross-trained for different departments within the store I worked at.  Overall the management team can be indecisive on some necessary tasks.  _x000D__x000D_I enjoyed working in the garden center since I first started for the company.

okay,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, because it gave me a chance to experience new things. The only thing that I did not like was the poor training that Walmart supervisors did for the employees.

If you had a family emergency such as death it is not ok to call in at all, even if its your first time calling in, unless you want to go the rest of the week with dirty looks from all the management and rude comments to you about it even though you explained to them the situation.

Nothing Bad,"This is a nice Walmart that's what I would call ""on the edge of nowhere"". It's not the newest, as it's been around about 4-5 years, but the community hasn't been totally developed around it yet, so it's not super crowded, there's plenty of parking and no one is panhandling for a cash in the parking lot like many other Walmart's in the area. _x000D__x000D_I checked this place out for the first time just this week and picked up some clearance items for the new home from the after Christmas sales.

It was a very productive place to work.,A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves and zoning aisles. I learned how to stock shelves at a fast pace and accurately locate items in the store. The management was very helpful in helping me find new items and where they needed to go. My co-workers were very helpful in helping me complete my stocking tasks when I got behind. The hardest part of the job was getting the stocking tasks done in the time they gave you to complete the aisles. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting done early with my stocking tasks and then going to help others finish their tasks.,5,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Helena, AL",1/4/17,2017,1,4

What's the point?,"They made it clear from orientation that customers and money are above all else. Just handed me a box cutter and a vest, and sent me to the backroom. The pay for the work done was abysmal. The benefits are a joke. Management is always looking for a reason to get rid of someone. The safety culture is nonexistent.

"Starting pay and benefits ok, actual concern for employees and customers needs improvement.","Wal-Mart stores should improve treatment of workers and customers. There are some store managers who seem legitimatally interested in the needs of their employees and customers, but over all as a company Wal-Mart's actual concern for its employees and customers seems minimal. An employee shopping discount and some holiday and sick time is offered to hourly employees, and pay is competitive in comparison to other national retailers. However, as one of the nation's largest and wealthiest corporations, hourly pay and part-time employee benefits should be increased. Also, a major issue that negatively affects both store employees and customers is that stores are frequently inadequately staffed, especially at the cash registers. This leads to higher employee fatigue and stress, poorer customer service, and to a more time-consuming shopping experience. Keeping prices lower and corporate profits higher seem to be prioritized over customer service and employee well-being. The company's commitments to selling more American-manufactured goods and hiring more veterans are commendable, but over all Wal-Mart has much room for improvement.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,NY,1/4/17,2017,1,4
Hard Work,"The company is nationwide. It's like hurry and get it done. It should be about getting it done right the first time. Prioritize. Customers should be the focus. By hurrying to place items on the shelves you overlook items that should be rotated. I take pride in what I do every day. I may take a few minutes longer to do the job, but when I leave each day I know that each customer was greeted with a genuine smile and shown personally where the items were located. They leave with a smile. My success is achieved. Happy customers come back to see smiling faces and to be treated with respect. Hurrying causes delays and you feel like a robot. Well, I am glad to say I believe in being honest to yourself. I care about every person walking through those doors. It's someone's Mother, Father, Sister, Brother, Aunt, Uncle, Child, Baby. They all deserve the appreciation of a few minutes of your day for a genuine smile. That may be the only reason they come to your facility. The dollar figure to me is out the window. A smile can outlast that dollar bill in your pocket. Making time to chat and smile makes people want to come back. Happiness comes from within.""",4,Current Employee,Associate ,"Rapid City, SD",1/4/17,2017,1,4
Cashering,"It is a fast working environment and this job requires for you to be on your feet all day. You learn about the difference between Wal-Mart's policies verses the state's policies.

The managers of my department gave me trouble whenever I had to keep telling them to adjust my work schedule so it wouldn't overlap my college schedule which wasn't many hours.

The coworkers were all very nice and usually always helpful. the hardest part of the job was trying to get 3-5 different bosses orders done in a timely fashion while prioritizing from highest to lowest degree of boss.

Walmart,"A typical day for me as a sales floor associate at Walmart would be first & foremost, customer service. Although there were usually 2 or 3 of us in the department, when regular customers came to my department, they always asked for me because I was the one that was able to answer their questions, or help with their problems or just simply assist them with with a smile on my face. I worked in the toy department for 3 years & worked as a truck unloader for the last 10 years of my career at Walmart. Being an unloader was a fast paced, very physical job, but I loved it.

I learned more about some of the electronics while working here. Management was kinda disorganized since the place was brand new. My cowokers were pretty cool. Everyone close to the same age. The hardest part was how busy it could get and keeping up with the keys to all the products back in electronics. It was like a HUGE deal of the keys were missing. Managers scrambling to figure out where they are. But yes it can get very busy especially during the holidays. The best part was that it was pretty busy each day. Makes the day go by faster.

Unforgiving work environment,"Management at Walmart is something I had heard was bad, but until I experienced it myself I truly had no idea. the amount of potential appreciation is drowned out by the constant disappointment of management. When you do something wrong and management knows about it, instead of bringing it up to prevent similar problems in the future, they will wait for you to do it again so they can bring it up as an ""on-going"" problems. The supervisors are used only to tell management when the associates have done something wrong, and even can get in trouble when talking about how everything is going well.

Sometimes feels frustrating but can be a nice place to work as well.,"A typical day working as a fresh associate at Walmart in the produce department during the night shift consists of culling expired product, cleaning, customer service and stocking product to the sales floor.  Working here has taught me to have thick skin.  There are a lot of times when my work has been criticized and this is often times not balanced with any positive or really substantive feedback that will help me to improve my performance.

Don't expect much more than a headache.,"I've been with the company for only 3 years, and I've already seen more than half of the workforce changed. More than once. The management makes you so miserable that you can't help but contemplate leaving. Aside from personality problems, the management team doesn't know how to make a schedule either. They'll have you work till 10-11p.m. one night, and have you come back in at 6 the next morning. The scheduling is so erratic that it's impossible to have a life outside of work. Sleep schedule? Nope. On top of hours that make you want to quit, there are hardly ever any employees in any area on any given day. You can go anywhere from toys, to cashing, to housewares, to grocery, to unloading a truck, to anywhere in the place. All because if they schedule less than the given hours, they get a bigger bonus. The only good thing about this place is that they pay better than most others. It's pretty much the only thing that keeps the few people that work there from leaving.",1,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"North Tonawanda, NY",1/2/17,2017,1,2
Good place to work as a starter job,"Good starter job but not something one might want to do the rest of their life.

At Walmart that wasn't true they were under staff in my apartment because they didn't want to pay more employees, so there was never a way to complete my job because I didn't have enough help. Instead of seeing that we needed more help the management kept telling us t work harder and take shorter breaks.

Not a good Place to work,Very sexist environment. They do not keep promises of raises like they say they do. Management is very sexist against women. Do not care about their employees. My Fiance was given 2 raises in a month for no reason and he very much agrees that the place is very sexist against women as well. Another one of my Co-Workers got sexually harassed by a male department manager there and HR as well as the store manager did nothing about it.

very exciting place to work,Walmart is a great place to work but certain areas don't offer many hours and this is hard for a person that has a family.

It is fun to learn several positions because you can become an asset to the company by being a flexible employee.,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Duluth, GA",1/2/17,2017,1,2
"Consistent hours, good people, bad customers and worse store policies.","I've worked at two different Walmarts over the past two years, and the experiences were rather different, so your mileage may vary depending on your store's individual management. Overall working at Walmart was a perfectly fine experience; not particularly outstanding but the people working there have generally been friendly and willing to help out with things, and the management tends to not be very hands on, which I appreciate. That said, you get very little respect from the company side of things and somehow even less from most customers, with a few shining gems. Do not go to Walmart to get a rewarding feeling of interacting with and helping people, you will be disappointed. Their firing policies are also incredibly strict; starting out I was given 3 absences total over the course of 6 months, and being late once lead to immediate dismissal even with extenuating circumstances.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rolla, MO",1/2/17,2017,1,2

The management was difficult to find when anyone needed assistance, yet between coworkers we managed to effectively work out problems that might occur.

Review for walamart,"At store 588, where I was working, there is a multitude of issues that complicate even the simplest of work to be done in store. Management has a very difficult time handling the store, communication is a problem due to authoritative abuse, and meager fights for power. The employees are worked far harder then legally allowed and never gets the respect or compensation deserved. As a result the moral is low and the Termination rate is high and what's worse about these issues is that it no one cares to help.",3,Former Employee,Inventory Management Systems associate ,"Albany, GA",1/2/17,2017,1,2

"pay was decent, overall company was not great.","A typical day here was scanning and checking customer needs (groceries), dealing with a huge spectrum of different people, and moods. I learned patience here, as some of the customers were either elderly, young, in a bad mood, etc. This also taught me how to communicate effectively. Management was very poor, they were only there to make sure everyone was working but was not willing to step in and help those where needed, they were poor on training in departments of the store as well. I'd say the co-workers there were 50/50, some were really easy to get along with and welcoming while others were not. The hardest part was dealing with management if there were ever a problem, at times they were unreliable to showing up to where they were needed and would take up to 20 minutes to get to you and the unhappy customer. The most enjoyable part was going home.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Conway, AR",1/2/17,2017,1,2
Okay place to start out if looking for job,They try to be flexible with your hours unless it's the holidays. Work at walmart for almost 1 year and still getting $9 an hour due to completing pathways but changed jobs so was given more pathways and they also have an excuse for everything like not getting your bonus.

The Devil wears prada and manages the Rockaway Walmart,"Store manger only concerned about her bonuses. I had been interrupted assisting a customer on several occasions to immediately dust shelving or replace an end-cap due to one item being sold (end display no longer full).  Department/Zone managers routinely used to unload trucks while wearing ties/heels suit jackets/business attire .  One minute of over-time and you were written up, even if it was due to helping a customer (expected to abandon customers at the end of your shift).  A third offense of 1 minute or more and you were dismissed. Morale was absolutely horrible.  As a department manager you were expected to adjust your hours to stay within hours even if it meant clocking out for a 5 hour lunch at the end of the pay period so you were there at the start and end of the shift.  I had never worked for anyone that tracked time to the hundredth of an hour!  A paid day off for Walmart does not mean 8 hours paid day off for Christmas day, but the average number of hours you worked in a day; my ""paid day off"" equaled 6.42 hours worth of pay.

Decent workplace sometimes fun,A typical work day would start out with a meeting followed by a second meeting with the maintenance staff the job required you to use a dust mop to sweep the floor and then use powered scrubbers to clean the floor the hardest part of this job was keeping up with management as management was not very good and head you moving around the store too much management made it hard to complete tasks given to you by your boss,3,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance ,"Pryor Creek, OK",1/1/17,2017,1,1

The managers are very open with you and willing to help when you need it, don't be afraid to ask them or surrounding employees for help if you have a question. _x000D__x000D_My only issue was standing up for so long, the occassional aggitated customer, and the large spread of days off. I did get breaks and the occasional lunch break when allowed but it was mainly my responsibility to keep track of time to take those breaks (managers were always busy running around). The extra benefits aren't for everyone._x000D__x000D_The training took forever and a day to complete (6-months) but it's neccessary so you know the systems and procedures. I learned so much about the company that way. Once you finish the 6-month training, your pay is raised to $11/hour, so it's good motivation. Be very careful with the mistakes you make; clocking in too early or too late will get you in trouble and missing the due dates to your training will get you in trouble aside from the obvious mishaps with customers and the register (hopefully you have none). _x000D__x000D_Pay attention to what you're doing, learn fast, and be curtious to everyone and anyone can do well with this job.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Dumfries, VA",1/1/17,2017,1,1

Sometimes the managers don't look to see where else you can help. Most of the coworkers are rude and unfriendly, and they do not focus completely on their tasks. During my last day there i was working with a guy who kept questioning me about personal issues, and he was being very rude to me. The hardest part of the job was trying to stock items that were in a plain brown box with no label to help you find where they belong on the shelf. There was nothing at all enjoyable about the job.

The management and co-worker were really friendly and polite, I'd never had a problem with anyone there. They treated me like family there and everyone there is willing to help you out if you are stuck with something. They even train you if you are pretty new to the position that you applied for. What I have learned and I find kind of stupid is that you can't get full benefits with them unless you have been working there for a year and work full-time hours, also you can't get sick leave unless you had worked there for 4 years or more. There attendance is just wack because you can only miss 3 days in the past 6 months. You can't even get your employee discount after 3 months that you have get from mail.

needs improvement,They have a very strict attendance policy and gives no exceptions even with doctors note. Management is confusing you talk to one manager they just tell you to go to the next manager its nothing but a circle and never fully settles whatever the issue maybe. They cut back hours for no reason and have you working 25 hours every two weeks. They also will play you out your bonuses and tell you ...you missed it by a day or two. Walmart is a very cheap company to make as much money as they do. I've been there for 9 months and have been trained for customer service and the money center but still will not get offered a chance to move up. They train you for other stuff that requires higher pay and have you work it without coding you for that station so they dont have to pay you for that position.,3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"pensacola,fl",12/29/16,2016,12,29

I simply loved it.,"Wal-Mart was a great opportunity for learning and climbing the ladder. Mangers and floor supervisors always quick and friendly and they made sure you were properly trained. To move up in the company all you had to do was ask to learn a different department.  One of the biggest downfalls though, was the point system they had for attendance. The first 6 months you had 4 points. Calling in with or without a doctor's note got you 1 point. Being 30 minutes+ late got you half a point. But all you had to do was talk to your hiring manager and if it was a good enough reason they'd remove the point.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Great Bend, KS",12/29/16,2016,12,29

learning lessons in Corporate Retail Companies,"over all my take on my time served at Wal -Mart was job security. I was improperly trained then scolded for not knowing what to do , then high array of turn over makes it difficult to know what levels of education each co worker brings to a shift, this included management.

There are ups and downs of Walmart,"Working for Walmart has been an interesting experience. There are plenty of opportunities to advance, to grow, and to learn. There are many benefits to take advantage of such as discount off of merchandise (excluded groceries), opportunities to build a 401K as well as health insurance. The downside of this company is the ever changing rules and policies. It seems at least twice a year of more a policy changes and the communication of the those changes are lacking. Despite the negative Walmart is a good place to work because they work around a person's schedule which makes it easy for college students and people wanting a second job to secure employment with them .",4,Former Employee,Merchandise Supervisor ,"Shippensburg, PA",12/27/16,2016,12,27

Lively and never typical,"A typical day is coming in and being amazed at what's new. New coworkers, new events, new customers. I learned to keep a poker face and sometimes customers actually do give happy hugs for your outstanding service. I also learned that giving a hug to a customer when needed is alright too. Management is there if you need them the majority of the time. You meet so many great outstanding people who make Walmart run like a well oiled machine. The hardest part of the job is seeing people hired to do a job (but they refuse to be active), and then being let go because of attitude or laziness. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new customers every day. Being active and helping people is very rewarding. When you go home at night you're tired from using your brain and thinking of ways to help and being active. You may walk from one end of the store to the other 15 times in a day. My motto ""always smile and greet customers"". It's called job security because without them there is no ""us"".",5,Former Employee,Jewelry and Shoes Sales Associate ,"Mooresville, NC 28115",12/27/16,2016,12,27

Big issue with favoritism.,Managers will only promote you as long as you go along with the way they want things done.

"Hired while in early pregnancy, then asked to resign when medical issues arised.","When I started working at Walmart, I was really early into a pregnancy and it was undetectable. A few months later, I had preterm labor issues and was told by my doctor to ask for reasonable accommodations to lessen the stress on my body or that I would have to leave my job. So I informed the manager and gave her the note at which time I was informed ""You know, when I hired you, you didn't LOOK pregnant..."" I was then informed that sitting in a chair while at a register wasn't something they could do for me, so they moved me to the fitting rooms so I could take it easy. I would get constantly bombarded and complained about because I wasn't running around all of the clothing areas organizing, which was not the description of my temporary position as necessary due to the medical issues. I was to sit and answer the phone. PERIOD. I spoke again with the manager and asked her if there was any way that someone could inform my coworkers that I was in a temporary position and what that meant for my job description at the time. My manager then said they would not do that and strongly suggested I resign my position. To which, I agreed as to not be fired.",3,Former Employee,Cashier / Fitting Rooms Attendant ,"Phoenix, AZ",12/27/16,2016,12,27

Hard labor,"I worked for Walmart through a staff agency , so getting regular hours or benefits for the company was not possible. I recommend getting hired directly through Walmart if working there.

Productive and fun workplace,Typical day at work was doing as my department manager asked. I learned how to bake and set out bread for the following day. I also learned how to ice cakes.

The most enjoyable part was when I finished all my assigned tasks and got to help ice cakes with the cake decorators.,4,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Fort Wayne, IN",12/27/16,2016,12,27
Not a good job when trying to make it on your own.,"If trying to make a good living and raise kids and have a happy family, this is not the job for you. They pay as little as possible and usually when you have an injury or problem, managment does not care._x000D_Wal-Mart's policy says that if any employee has a disability Wal-Mart is required to find a way to provide that person a way to do their job, but I made a very good friend at Wal-Mart who had Neuropathy, meaning, that sertain movements and pressure in certain areas would cause his body to lock up. Our Wal-Mart did not follow policy and fired my friend because ANOTHER associate- and not himself- ran his foot over and broke his toe, and one day he took advice on pulling carts from another associate and the way they told him to do it caused his neuropathy to act up._x000D_Seriously. If you wont follow YOUR OWN POLICY and if your going to fire employes because of something that is not their fault, just imagine all the lives your ging to ruin._x000D_Right now im in a very tight situation and I am dealing wiht big issues because of Wal-Mart._x000D_So yeah, if you live with your mom and you don't have the risk of going homeless, then go ahead and work for Wal-mart, but if you plan to save up for anything or are living on your own, DO NOT CONSIDDER THIS JOB._x000D_A Wal-Mart near you may be fine, but I noticed that this problem is mainly exsistant in Washington state Wal-Mart's.",2,Former Employee,Mintenance and Cap Team 1 ,"Hazel Dell, WA",12/27/16,2016,12,27

Managment that cares but lacks contact effort,"Typically I Marked and moved boxes of product. The job was pretty nice because I got to talk to people and make friends. Managment did care about us and did their best to make sure that they provided the easiest way to complete our job. I learned how to use inventory devises such as MC-40's. The most enjoyable part of the job was simply working, I actually liked my job, but the hardest part of the job was that they did not give me a solid schedule that I could work on and my schedule jumped all over the calendar without notice, sometimes even while I was on my way into work the schedule would change and say that I was already supposed to be there. I was never notified by the store about any schedule changes.",3,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Vancouver, WA",12/27/16,2016,12,27

"Management only wants to flex their power, not achieve results","Management is typically highly uninformed and sets unrealistic deadlines without ever actually having done or observe the work being done. Days are stressful, heavy lifting constantly, stores are always extremely understaffed. Sometimes there are supervisors who understand workloads and are realistic in terms of deadlines, but rarely. Coworkers are usually good people who want to help customers and other co-workers so job culture is good. Job advancement is almost entirely political and whoever is the favorite, not based on knowledge or work performance.

Management switched every few months some were very bad at organizing workers and tasks as well as getting onto workers who were not doing their job. My hardest part of my job was picking up the slack of co workers who refused to do their part, they would vanish and hide in the store or go out and sleep in their cars.

Not A Good Workplace Or Environment At All,This company uses people like an assembly line in a factory. No benefits and low pay. The training is terrible. They don't train they're workers thoroughly or properly before putting them on the floor. Everything is rushed. The management was very poor at this particular Walmart. They were unable to deal with the diversity of their workers.

Long and tedious,"Show up, stand in typical nightly meeting, go to assigned station, unload boxes, stock items, take break, stock, take lunch, stock, take break, face shelves, go home. I was good at all of this since i had already worked in a grocery store before. This was more strict since it is Walmart, but i feel the management could be a little more lenient on allowing certain things for comfort. The hardest part i'd say was being awake at night. No matter how much you sleep in preparation, it's still hard to cope with working at night. In my opinion,  the best part was facing shelves. If you don't know what that means it's when you make the shelves line up in the front and look pretty.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Independence, MO",12/24/16,2016,12,24
Fast paced steady changing work environment.,"While with Wal-Mart I learned an extrodinary amount of knowledge on leading people, managing a multi-million dollar store.

A decent job with room for advancement,"A typical day involves helping customers, putting merchandise out, using a multi-line phone, correcting counts of product inventory, and tidying my area. The hardest part of the job is completing all the tasks an assistant or co-manager asks of you. This is because you also have to help customers find what they need. There is also a set time when every associate in the store must stop what they are doing and go help straighten up grocery for at least one hour.

You'll even see people stealing things but you can't stop them, only a member of management or AP can do so. You'll get two 15 minute breaks if you work an 8 hour shift and hour lunch, which isn't bad. I learned though that this place will suck the life out of you. If you know how to do your job and do it well, you get rewarded with more stuff that the lazy person before you didn't do! Overall thought this place isn't that bad as I'm making it out to be.

I have been trying to find another job that is at least 30 hours a week. They also offered good insurance.  I started at 8.00 am hour and ended up making 13.00 plus an hour. My reviews were always satisfactory and fair. I also got a discount if I bought anything there. There was a subway store that I could get lunch in the entrance. There was also a bank in the store that we could use if we wished altogether a nice place to work.,5,Former Employee,Maintence ,"Sandusky, OH",12/23/16,2016,12,23

Great place to work with exceptions,I really enjoyed working at Walmart the job it's self is pretty simple and self explanatory. However I had a few issues while I worked there. I started out working as a sales associate I worked in the shoe department. There were so many different managers and they didn't communicate with each other very well. I was constantly getting all of these different tasks from different managers. It became impossible for 1 person to complete all the tasks in their department and all of the 1s the managers gave on top of it. Then they made me a cashier I really enjoyed being a cashier however I was a minor at the time and by law couldn't work past 10pm the csm would hardly ever let me off the register in enough time for me to clock out by 10pm and I always got in trouble because of it.  No matter how many times I tried to explain what happened they didn't seem to listen. Other than that I really did enjoy working there.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate and Cashier ,"Muscatine, IA",12/23/16,2016,12,23

My Time at Walmart.,"Overall, working at Walmart was good. I made friends, loved to do my job and helped a lot of people. The only thing Walmart needs to work on is who they hire for Management. They're unprofessional in certain ways and don't know how to treat some of their associates. A typical day starts like any other, you wake up and go to work. In my department, it starts with phone inventory, running friehgt and then starting photo. It goes smoothly most days, but others we get busy right from the beginning. I've learned that I liked working, it filled my life with a purpose and it showed me things that I didn't know. I've learned more about technology then I ever could have by myself. As I've said before, the management there in the Walmart I worked, needs sever improvement. My co-workers were the best I've ever had, we had great times. Besides doing our jobs, we've become friends so we've had our goofy times at work. I've never been more happier in my life until I met them. The hardest part of my job was being left alone by myself in the department and then being overwhelmed by so many customers all at once, but however like most things, what has bad will have the good. The most enjoyable part of my job, was the peopole that I worked with. They are what made my time at Walmart, worth while.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Washington, IN",12/22/16,2016,12,22

3 crippling reasons to stay away from the corrupt company that is Walmar,"To start, I learned my job, but with little help. Managers don't know how to be managers, and last they don't care about you or your family! _x000D__x000D_Reason #1: They underpay women and neglect pregnant workers!_x000D_Reason #2: They also discriminate against elderly or anyone with a disability. _x000D_Reason #3: It is the most unsafe environment for employees, mentally and physically!_x000D__x000D_So why do I choose these three reasons? Its because I have witnessed it first hand in my own store! Its all hunky dory when their masks are on, but once they take it off is doom and gloom! The store manger has no clue what she is doing and no respect for any one else but herself. The only reason why I lasted as long as I did was by keeping my self invisible from the chiefs upstairs. _x000D__x000D_Hope this helps weigh in on your decision when deciding on working for a Walmart. Just remember! Just because I had a bad time and or experience working for them does not mean you will too! This over all is just my opinion!

A job,"Walmart is an impersonal company to work for, the expectation is clear that you work regardless of condition that could be dangerous to the employee's life or any type of illness whether it be the employee or a family member. Generally management is also trained to treat you impersonally. The positive thing that I can say about Walmart is that they are never late with a paycheck and if you are fortunate to find grace among your coworkers and possible supervisors, it can make it a bearable experience. Holidays will also be something that you will be expected to work. The bottom line is that you work when you are scheduled, you will be given the work of more than one person to handle because that helps keeps the costs of running their company down. I have worked for this company a total of 9 years twice. It is not a job that I would recommend to most people unless they are okay with the generalized set up of the company.",2,Former Employee,Sales Floor Representative-Wireless Associate ,"Marion, SC",12/22/16,2016,12,22

Also when I worked there it was my very first job so i was excited and gullible to the environment like ""wow this looks cool"", but for people experienced in the retail or has had another job i wouldn't recommend because i felt like was was being pushed and blamed for things that were out of my control. In all fairness Walmart is not that bad all you have to do is play dumb and do the job because what i did was i was in charge of the meat department and the lunch meat with stocking all of it,so just do your job and don't try to change anyone mind because it could go good or really bad.",3,Former Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Plainfield, IL",12/22/16,2016,12,22

Also, there was a lot of rumor spreading that went on and I couldn't understand why so much drama was part of a stocker position in Wal-Mart.  I came to work, did my job, and went home.

would not work for walmart!!!!!!!!!,The management sucked. For staters each manager had their own opinion on how things should be done. but they are not walmart guidelines. Prime example a CSS manager tells a sales associate to do a transaction for a customer  and he would fix it in the system a little later in the day so the price override doesn't make the draw short but manager never fixed it so associate gets fired. over management stupidity but its things like that.

Didn't feel like I had any job security,"Production quota was very high.  30 pallets per hour.  It took me 20-30 minutes just to unload most trailers, and then I had to break all the pallets down according to a height sheet.  Space was an issue, and often I found myself never having enough of it to work in.   As if all of that wasn't challenging enough, there wasn't enough forklifts and clamp trucks to go around.  So I was usually stuck walking around the distribution center, wasting precious time, looking for equipment to use.  People generally didn't want to share the clamp trucks because they were in such short supply.  All of this lead me to consistently fall short of my quota._x000D_Fellow employees were very hit or miss.

Very seldom did we see management unless it was to see how long it was going to be before the truck was unloaded. The hardest part ofcthe job was being there til 1:30 to 2:00 am and no one appreciating the job and hard work we did.

"Fun, workable hours",I had a good time working at Wal-Mart because the people I worked with get along well with each other. I learned new things every day in how to put merchandise away quickly. The management could be worked on a little bit more and not so un-enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is getting all the merchandise done on time. What i do like about the job was helping out customers look for what they need or wanted.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Twin Falls, ID",12/17/16,2016,12,17
I believe management needs a true schooling on how to manage in the walmart empire.,Walmart is great to shop at but not so much to work for. Maybe if they had better training on customer service and how to speak to they employees  and not hide from an angry customer thing would be great.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"West Mifflin, PA",12/17/16,2016,12,17

sometimes,Wal mart was a good second job for me. But it never made me feel safe because if you didn't do exactly what management say and how you could be fired on the spot.,4,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Suffolk, VA",12/17/16,2016,12,17
Location left me wanting,"I started out loving the job, I felt respected and made a lot of headway in learning the processes. I was trained by floor management because I let them know I was interested in promoting and worked hard at it. They told me they have a 6 month minimum before you can promote, which is understandable. Then things started going south. They hired in 3 employees as cashiers and promoted them immediately to the position I wanted. When asked about it, they claimed these people had previous experience, despite one having been fired from walmart multiple times, and the other not even having walmart manager experience. Then the location I was at was robbed 5 times in a month. I asked to transfer because I didn't feel safe, and was met with criticism from management calling me ""thin-skinned"" for not being able to deal with it. They also wouldn't let me transfer._x000D__x000D_I worked some days helping other stores out, and I noticed that other stores were much less stressful, I believe the location I was at just gave me a really bad experience for the walmart life. I effectively worked the position I wanted without the official promotion, so I was considered a ""backup"" floor manager, but no title or raise. It became unbearable there with the safety issues and being undervalued for my contribution, and since I couldn't transfer, I ended up having to quit. _x000D__x000D_Overall most of the cashiers were great, they made it worth working there. but almost all of my higher ups went from respectful to condescending toward me and clearly didn't care for the well being of the employee's.",2,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate/ Backup CSM ,"Evansville, IN",12/17/16,2016,12,17
This is like a last resort job,"Walmart is all about how you make it, not saying working conditions were not terrible. Job security is one of the biggest issues for me because management would literally tell you that you could be replaced at the drop of a hat. The hardest part of the job was be able to get a raise. Typically when you get hired you are suppoosed to finish all the computer modules or (CBLs) at the job but I was thrown on to the sales floor without prior knowledge of what I was supposed to do. Of course you get to physically train with someone but when it is busy it is hard to grasp every thing you need to know. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is meeting need people from all walks of life.",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Montgomery, AL",12/17/16,2016,12,17

Extremely fast paced with little to no enjoyment.,"From the three months that I had been employed with Walmart I had noticed several problems. Not only was I not properly trained, in less than a week I was already put out on the floor. Only completing online training, certain modules only teach you the basics. We were never taught in depth, we learned from ourselves and other employees who also had no idea if what they were doing was correct or not. _x000D__x000D_Not given the proper tools in my department (An MC40), I was repeatedly put into the same area for the sole purpose of not needing to use it. Constantly barged in on if I wasn't going to the pace they had wanted me to go on. (Managers had done this intentionally to avoid teaching me how to use the scanning gadget).  _x000D__x000D_We're given a number of hours depending on the amount of freight each department gets. So the managers on duty expect us to not only get done by that time, they expect us to get done even BEFORE. Rushing us as we go, they are not at all enthusiastic if all stockers get to another department to help out someone else. _x000D__x000D_The job wasn't enjoyable to me, and that is probably the reason why I had called off so many times.

It's alright,A typical day at work as a front cashier is how you will have to deal with customers on a daily basis. Some customers are very understanding while others are quite rude. I learned how one needs to stay positive regardless of what happens during the day. The management team were on top. My co-workers were very friendly and talkative. You will feel as a team. The hardest part about the job if I had to say was not working there but the hours. It's difficult to manage with the hours since you can receives shifts as early as 6am to as late as 12am. The hours varies based on your availability. If one puts themselves as available everyday anytime then expect to have a shift as early as 6am to 9am following after another shift just as early as the previous one.

No more holiday pay, forced to work thanksgiving but that schedule doesn't come out until that week so you can't make plans. No holiday pay any more, took away the Sunday premium from those who had been grandfathered into that. Constantly understaffed, and often worked areas outside of job description.

I tried to see if we can get a raise because 9.00 an hour wasn't enough to maintain a proper life style.

If you are unlucky, they may cut your shifts so far down you will be unable to continue. There are some good people to work with and I have made some friends. The management is another story. Favorites are played and if you are not in, you are out. The employee discount is nifty but probably not worth the abuse. It is standard procedure for management to tell associates they must do things one way and then force them into situations where they must complete tasks conflicting whatever has been explained to them not to do.

I love the management that I have in this store because they pay attention and actually care about their employees and what goes on inside their lives outside of work. The hardest part of the job for me is when I have to discipline people who do not do what they are told.

Fun and great place,It is overall a great place to work for. After your 3 months of being there you get your discount card.

A little harder than I thought,Boy working in the deli at Walmart was little harder than i thought. I was always on the counter helping the customers with their orders.

My day at work.,"My shifts were usually 7am-4pm about 4-5 days a week.The closest Walmart to me was within easy biking distance, so I would ride my bike to work everyday. The Customer Service wasn't busy until about 10am, so I would have only a few customers with simple returns early mornings. Between 1-4pm were the rush hour times it seemed, I would be the only person at the Customer Service so when it got busy my managers would have to help out witch made my job much easier because they were very helpful and a lot of the time customers would ask to speak to managers anyways. My managers also helped a lot with the customers since they knew more than I did and could learn more from them for the next customers with the same questions. The Hardest part for me was when their was difficult customers to handle on my own and I had to call a manager and than the customers were very rude to the manager who was only trying to help them. The best part was about when my shift ended, having my work place all cleaned up after my shift, getting everything done I needed to and more, and making sure all the customers left happy and would come back again.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Tucson, AZ",12/11/16,2016,12,11

Don't Work At Walmart Ever,"Walmart was a good way to get back on my feet, but that's about it. I hated the fact that they lied about every new employee getting at least $10 starting out. You actually only get $9 and you get bumped up to $10 once you do Pathways. This is Walmart's training program that takes more than 6 months usually. The manager would constantly harass me even when I'm doing my job. The manager would also never give me any time off even if I put in time off 3 months in advance. Also, Walmart constantly would pull you from your department to go do work in other sections you have no knowledge of. Meantime, while you're over there your department is usually unmanned because Walmart never has enough people on staff for the day. That means I had to do 3 people's work most of the time. I was the photo lab associate initially, but I also had to be an electronics associate unofficially, get fish out the fish tank, work freight, be cashier up front, and cart pusher. Unless you are desperate for cash and are willing to take $9 an hour and lack of hours available on your work schedule don't bother. Trust me I worked there for 6 months and I can honestly say you're better off being a garbage man cus at least they get paid more.",1,Former Employee,Photo Lab and Electronics Associate ,"Augusta, GA",12/10/16,2016,12,10
Customer Service is Number One,The pay could be a little better for all that we do. Hours could also be better and the company would still benefit.

I need something that is 7-3 or 8-5 or something every day not 1:30-10:30pm then the next day 7am-4:30pm. No one who has a family can live on these hours.

My co workers were amazing, we always got along and we were there to help each other on anything that needed to be done and they were falling behind on during the day.

One time, an Assistant Manager called the police on a lady for asking to see the policy on price matching, and had her escorted out by security with her children. I would walk into this place and get physically sick, I wouldnt suggest anyone work here unless you just really need the money, and sadly so many of my coworkers went home depressed because they were treated so badly by management, but they cant afford to get another job. I worked black friday, I had to be away from my family, but I was ok with being around my coworkers. Management told us we couldnt even talk to each other.

This good have fixed by a little lengthening of those times. The Elizabeth store was always understaffed(short by 1 technician), causing the other employees to get burnt out.

Hours have been constantly cut in the last 3 Months never received more than 35 hours per Week as a full time employee.  Any and all complaints are ignored by management and their standard response is “we are retail”.

It's not bad. Very fast paced and high volume. Very busy.,"I personally love working for Walmart. They pay great ($9/hr at hire, for lower level positions; cartpushers, cashiers, maintenance, and some department sales associates. After you complete your learning modules called ""Pathways"", then you are raised to $10/hr) You get 9 absence occurrences if you are off-probationary period. (3 months) During this probationary period you will only get 4. Be mindful that exceeding maximum occurrences equals probable termination. A no call no show is a total of 4 occurrences (Probationary newhires can be terminated at first occurrence of NCNS). The work on the General Merchandise side of your average Supercenter is regularly easy and usually consists of stocking freight and customer service. The work in the front end is usually customer interaction based, and it consists of using a GUI-based Point-of-Sale system. There are 5 types of positions in the front end; Cashier, Cartpusher, Maintenance, Customer Service Desk, and Supervisor. The work on the Grocery side of your average Supercenter is relatively higher stress, and more challenging. Laser precise focus and substantial movement speed is required to work in Meat, Produce, or the Bakery/Deli.",4,Current Employee,Produce Sales Associate ,Oklahoma,11/23/16,2016,11,23

Day off? Whats that?,"The work/life balance here reaaaalllyyyyyy sucked. Its as if walmart didn't know what a day off was. But my checks were always nice.

A great way to start a retail career,"Walmart is a juggernaut, there are numerous poor reviews already, but it's actually a job that can be very rewarding for those that put in the effort.

No doubt worst place I've ever worked hands down,"Well, I don't really know where to start with this one.

Hard working Corporation,"Walmart has gotten better over the years. Family first is what comes to mind when working for Walmart. Granted, the pay is acceptable and management has been hard at work whenever it's time to punch in. As an overnight stocker, work is completed at a certain time frame and co-workers are alwasy a joy to be around. The most enjoyable part of the shift is being able to use the term teamwork. We always help each other restock shelves so that we can be ready for customers who come in early in the morning. The hardest part is being able to clean up afterwards. It can be tough especially after customers leave trash behind, however, the job gets done in a orderly and timely fashion.",4,Current Employee,OVERNIGHT STOCKER ,"Converse, TX",11/21/16,2016,11,21
The stories you have heard are true,"The management manipulates everything. I have management experience and when I first started I totally wanted to advance and now there is no way i would consider it. Everything is our fault. I could be standing in the deli do my job and the ceiling could fall in on me and they would find a way to blame me and my co-workers. If you just shut up and agree to everything that is thrown your way, you will do fine. If you have an opinion as I do and speak your mind and question things, then well Wal-mart may not be the place for you",3,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Brewer, ME",11/21/16,2016,11,21

Management is horrible,"I've worked at two Walmarts and have friends/family across the country and I can say it seems that management is terrible across the board. Their training is a bunch of videos that don't really pertain to what you're doing, just the basics, then they throw you right into what you're doing. They expect either a lot out of you or nothing and don't really recognize others for picking up after the people they don't make do anything. They don't want to fire people even if they're terrible workers! Then they don't shift around people to make an equal workload because that's too much of an ""inconvenience"" to others.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Fresh Associate ,"Eau Claire, WI",11/21/16,2016,11,21

Micro Management,"This employer was a bad experience. Once again I have to focus on the attendance policy. They would hold certain weather conditions against there employees.

Management was unfortunately incredibly unprofessional which ultimately led to my leaving. My coworkers were mostly wonderful. _x000D_The hardest part for me was probably the heavy lifting, but adapting wasn't a problem for me. The best part was the customer service aspect, mainly due to me not only being great at interacting with customers but also thriving on seeing how my positive attitude affects customers in a really great way.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Hamburg, NY",11/19/16,2016,11,19

"Productive and interesting, just keep a positive attitude for best results.","Working at Wal-Mart can be a pleasurable experience, depending on whom you work with, and what kind of customers you have that day/week. The hardest part of the job is definitely customer's attitudes. You have happy ones, which are awesome, and you have one's with no personality, whom usually do not speak back if you initiate conversation, and you have down right rude ones, whom are crabby and complain about everything in sight. The best way to handle all of these people is to keep smiling and move on to the next customer as quickly as possible. The enjoyable part are the happy customers that make you laugh when your day seems to be going downhill. As far as co-workers and managers, they are usually a joy to be around-typically no issues there. Just keep a positive attitude and you should survive, just take it day by day.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Oxford, AL",11/18/16,2016,11,18

I learned to be on time and how to better clean bathrooms.",5,Former Employee,maintenance ,"Meridian, ID",11/18/16,2016,11,18
the worst company to work for,the absolute company to work for.  management doesnt care about its employees and getting time off is like pulling teeth.  you arent really assigned to anywhere specific in the store but are expected to know every fine detail about everything in the store.,1,Current Employee,Food Support Manager ,"Bay City, TX",11/18/16,2016,11,18

Its a ok place to work,I feel like the management does not know how to talk to their employees. The employees at Walmart are a little unorganized at times too.

Worst Work Experience I've Had,My time at Wal-Mart was something of an experience. My co-workers were more interested in trying to find ways to trick the system into letting them pay $5 for a new game that just came out rather than actually doing their job. Also management has this ability to completely ignore your school schedule and have you scheduled to come in to work 10 minutes after your class across campus from your dorm let out and would get mad about me being late. They didn't understand the fact that school came before work to me so I left.,1,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Canyon, TX",11/18/16,2016,11,18

Where do I even start.,Well don't get me wrong Walmart has become a lot better. I was a hard worker. Got promoted within a week of working there just showing initiative.

Work Overload,"Wal-mart is a great company to start off into the work force with. Unfortunately, due to their recent changes in policies, the work load has become extremely heavy for one individual. I am speaking from an overnight associates perspective. They terminate associates daily due to mainly attendance, but are not quick about hiring new associates, therefore increasing the work load for others._x000D_Certain managers are willing to work with certain associates. The benefits of the job are not as great as they seem.

Nope,"Just like with everywhere else, Walmart managers have favorites. But it goes beyond when people are getting fired for little things with no coaching when they are supposed to have 3 after their 90 days. When asked about it they give excuses and the run around. While others are magically getting coaching taken off early and promoted due to the fact that the associate and the managers are close. Walmart claims to have a justifiable system for acting on something they hear about associates but its really just he said/ she said things and nothing ever gets done, Managers tend to push people who are actually doing well really hard do to the fact that other associates aren't keeping up, so those associates end up doing 90% of the work  with scare tactics coming from all management to ""get the job done faster""",1,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Bradenton, FL",11/15/16,2016,11,15

"Great Start, Fast Paced, Customer Service Driven","This is a great place to start a career within the company. Every job/career has it's pros and cons. There is no job work/life balance. The schedule is always iffy it is subject to change any time the business see's fit so if you make plans to spend time with your family that probably won't happen. You hardly ever get two consecutive days off in a row so the days off aren't really enjoyable. You are always open 7 days a week until 9:00 o'clock and you work most major holidays so a lot of time is spent working rather than getting to enjoy family. You spend a lot of time getting screamed at and cussed out by customers and management is not really empathetic about the situation because they are not taking the phone calls. Also they hire outside supervisors instead of promoting within so you play second fiddle to someone who has never stepped foot in your department until they are hired and you train your supervisor so it easily upsets you because you feel you are not good enough. Besides that the company does try to work to make sure we do have days that are unlike any other employer . We do have days set aside to do something special such as nacho day, chili day, crazy sock day, costumes on Halloween, etc.There are all staff meeting where associates are acknowledged for hard work and dedication and there is plenty of opportunity to advance within the company. You also get PTO.",3,Former Employee,Resolution Specialist II ,"Bentonville, AR",11/14/16,2016,11,14

There is a reason Walmart does not have a union.,The work conditions are deplorable when your hours are not being cut.

About walmart,"My over all opinion about working at Walmart was terrible. The over night management was a nightmare. They were constantly scatter brained and always seemed to busy for their employees. There is a manager that was getting touchy feely with the female staff and instead of doing something about it they have ignored it. When it came to advancement they would advance someone who wasn't working no where near as hard as others. They would treat you as though you didn't matter.

Productivity and Job Experience,"Wal-Mart offers the chance for advancement with management training you hands-on, and even sending you to school to make sure you are equipped to handle the position you are applying for.  As long as you are productive, and are good on your performance than you don't have a problem because you are doing what any job expects you to do.  My co-workers exhibit teamwork such as if you can't finish the task at hand than they will help and you in return repay the favor.  The things I have learned is treat others the way you expect to be treated, and if you do not understand the task at hand than ask.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different people, and working with coworkers whose personality is different from yours which helps you understand others.  The hardest part of the job is making sure the store stays nice.  You have to make sure you are dedicated to anything you set out to do other than you will not feel satisfaction in that job at hand.

Overall Good,"I enjoyed the job itself, but the people and politics of the job are a little bit too much to handle at times. The manager I had was great and knew his job well. BUT they switch management and am stuck with someone that does not know how to correctly do my job and has never worked in the area before. So at times make sit hard to get things done when you need help because he also has to find help, which for a Manger to ask a normal employee an answer to a question he should know is unacceptable to me.",3,Current Employee,Unloader Processor ,"Ottawa, KS",11/7/16,2016,11,7

Can be wonderful if you find the position that suits you.,"I have worked a variety of positions; Bakery, Lawn and Garden, Back Room, and currently Deli. Food departments are very routine oriented doing the same things everyday. Lawn and Garden is only seasonal but a lot more to learn. Back Room is so short handed it is slightly stressful as well as routine oriented doing the same thing everyday. _x000D__x000D_Higher management can be a pain because things that need fixing rarely get done in a timely manner. But department managers I have found to be cordial and love to hear opinions about change and help to move things forward. _x000D__x000D_Coworkers are always a mixed bag. You will get people who like to work and those who do not. Some who are helpful and others who are not. So learning this before hand helps to prevent frustration with those who don't have a great work ethic. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job for me is the routine I like to learn new things. And I've worked at three different stores and they all have little things that are different about them. Whether cake in the breakroom for birthdays or not labeling things a certain way. _x000D__x000D_For me the most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with customers because there are only a few all day long (unlike being a cashier). I love being able to help people get the lowest price on something. _x000D__x000D_Overall Walmart isn't a terrible place to work just can be annoying at times.

Okay for being productive if you know what's required.,"Most days at Walmart were alright, I worked mornings until afternoons and sometimes afternoons until evenings. What I learned is to never get involved in ANY company's politics, they are really of no concern of yours unless you're about to either be retired or let go.  Management is minimal at best and overbearing at other times. My co-workers made my day because they felt that we were all in the same boat and wanted to help.  The hardest part of the job was locating managers, no matter the department, they never seemed to be available and the most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the different cellphones and the different cellphone plans out there that are available.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Spartanburg, SC",11/7/16,2016,11,7

Stressful,"Management was absolutely terrible. However, I loved working for Wal-Mart because of the many opportunities for advancement. If you work hard at this company it is very easy to move up.

Better for people with no or older kids,"When I first started at Walmart, it was a good place to work, but as the company leadership, company policies, and management on store level has changed, so has the work environment.  What was once an enjoyable place to work, is now a hostile work environment more focused on the money they can make for the stockholders than the overall health and happiness of the associate. I love working with customers, and went into being a department manager because I would have more face to face time with customers, and my home and work lives would be more balanced.  Within a few weeks, the paperwork the company kept making the department mangers' responsibility made it less possible to really spend time helping the customer and making them feel valued because there just isn't enough time to do it all and still go home to be with your family on time.",1,Current Employee,Apparel Department Manager ,"Warsaw, IN 46582",11/6/16,2016,11,6

"Easy, but fast paced work environment with helpful associates","I would be assigned an aisle on the grocery side of the store or a department and all the merchandise from that day's truck was out on the sales floor ready to be stocked. I learned how to search for items that may be in the backroom and where to find them.If we didn't have an item stock, I could look up when it would be coming in and could inform the customer. I would also inform the customer that they can look online if a store in their area would have the item in stock in the store or if it was only available online. I enjoyed working with the management, but at times it was difficult to find a member of management especially if one was requested by a customer. Overall, I enjoyed my time there. I enjoyed the environment, work, and people.",5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Albuquerque, NM",11/6/16,2016,11,6
General consensus of Walmart,"A typical day of work involves first getting & doing the returned merchandise. I also check to make sure my telxon, printer, and walkie all have full batteries or else I cannot do my job as effectively. Throughout the day I zone as needed and especially in the areas that really need it (that means clean up and put merchandise where it properly belongs). When needed (during times of high customer traffic) I will ring up customers at the cash registers._x000D__x000D_A typical day of work also involves cutting fabric for customers and general customer assistance such as answering any questions customers might have, and redirect them to the proper departments if my department does not have what they're looking for. Often I lead them to what they're looking for rather than just telling them.",1,Current Employee,"Salesfloor Associate, Cashier ","Exton, PA",11/6/16,2016,11,6

During time on floor stop and help customers as needed while still getting job done. Working in deli learned food prep and recipes per SOP, Cap ! learned unloading and separating skills, paperwork that went with that area. Cap 1 learned how to use an MC40 ( a handheld scanner/ computer similar to a blackberry) to do reverse picks, straight picks, bin merchandise in back for temporary storage, top stock and its guidelines. Often pulled from daily assignments to perform special tasks. Some of these included setting up filing systems for managers, set up feature displays on floor, organizing areas for sting things like laser printer supplies, labels, and various other supplies. Some other duties included deal with vendors and their wants and inventories. Refer to management if I didn't know answer to a question.(if a department manager was on vacation or leave and I knew the department)  Over all enjoyed working here and the people I worked with. Enjoyed learning new things especially because I feel the more I know the better I can do the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers.

Walmart does try to incorporate new things and ideas to keep up with the competition, however, lacks the manpower to keep up with the areas in the stores. Walmart does have several policies and recurring charitable donations to the employees in need and the surrounding community programs but often forgets the fundamentals the company itself was built on.

Wal-Mart,"On a typical day, pallets of product were rolled out and stocked on the shelf properly. Overall, I learned the value of teamwork and hard work. Management wasn't too great. A manager should be more of a leader than a boss. Co-workers were friendly and welcoming.

Not That Great of a Company,"I loved my co-workers, they were very helpful and kind, and I loved being able to check people out and put a smile on their face. However the way the place was not run very well. I was told by a supervisor that management was going to give me a coaching for my absences without following their rules and policy. First you are to have a discussion about the absences, then if that does not change then another discussion and a plan is to be made, if that does not work then you are to have a coaching. They wanted to skip the discussion, plan making and just give me a coaching. She caught wind and said that was not how things were done._x000D__x000D_I was not absent a lot, and most of my absences wracked up from being late. However more times than not my being late was due to their machines not working and a line piling up for employees to check in. There were times I was running late, jeans ripped, car accidents or whatever so I do take blame for those tardies, but the fact that we could not change it when it was not our fault was not something I appreciated. Later on they did give me a coaching without following procedure._x000D__x000D_We were never told what to do if we suspect counterfeit money, nor were we given pens or anything to really check. I was given real money and counterfeit mixed in with it.

"Fun place to work, but VERY up beat","I've worked for Walmart twice in the past. Both times were VERY up beat, especially around the holidays. Some of the management I dont feel were very ""business"" like. They would play on their phones all of their shift or stand around and talk to customers - but get other people to handle their tasks for them. I appreciate a manager who gets their ""hands dirty"" with the people who work under them. Just because they are paid more doesnt mean they get to neglect their duties. Also, communication amoung management was a problem in the second store I worked for. One manager would have me working on one end of the store, another manager would take me from that task and place me else where, then another manager wanted to write me up for not having my first task done. I think there were alot of underlying things there, but from my understanding since I left management has change and work conditions have improved.

Customers you work with can be very rude and expect the world just because they're angry, other employees will get you down because they complain about their jobs constantly, but it's alright as long as you can keep your chin up (and be able to recite policies to customers repeatedly with a straight face).

Don't work here if you're a happy person,"I worked for Walmart for 5 months and couldn't take it any longer. Management doesn't do anything but expects you to do everything. they're always understaffed and play favorites. As long as you are cool with a manager you can get away with doing nothing. I watched a coworker assault another employee, unprovoked, start several other altercations, amd was reported by a customer and still works there. I've also seen an older hard working employee get fired for ""wasting company time"" by having a conversation with another employee while working, mind you the other employee did not get fired. There are way too many managers who don't know what they're doing. The benefits, which don't kick it until after 3 months of employment are just 10% off but only on certain things.

Lacking oppurtunities to advance,"A typical day of work includes doing someone else's job upon arrival, not having communication between management and as a result someone is reprimanded, constantly switching areas and not being able to complete your own job. In the 2 years that I have worked at this Walmart I have been nothing but stressed and angry at the store. The only thing that kept me there was to provide excellent customer service for the people of the town otherwise, with the exception of some, it would not be done. Management is something to be desired whether it's from communication between each other or competency to do the job they are assigned. The hardest part of the job is most likely putting up with management. The most enjoyable part is helping out the customer and providing the best customer service possible. The employees as a whole are like family and they will never do you wrong.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Customer Service ,"Hutchinson, KS",10/31/16,2016,10,31

friendly positive work place,A typical day at Walmart is a busy day with plenty to do. There is always something to new to learn and plenty of work to do. You learn everything from the cash register to the computer system used by Walmart. Management pushes very hard to keep the store in good shape but they are very mean to the workers. I have seen managers curse out the employees and the employees will go right back at the managers. The breaks are very good and are about every two hours making the shift fly right by. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with customers for parts of the shift and also being able to work alone doing backroom work. Overall Walmart had a good balance of everything.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"New Orleans, LA",10/31/16,2016,10,31
"Fun place to work, Great for first job, Dont exspect to stay there long, Managers favoritize","Lets start off with Most managers as a general opinion they would have there favorite people, These are the ones who get certified and the Manager will also stick his neck out for these guys to help them save there job. Even if that means throwing you under the bus for something you didn't do. But at the same time theres not a single associate that isn't favored by atleast one of the managers, some associate get favored more but there will always be the one manager that will help you keep your job, even tho every morning they start the daily meeting by saying ""Remember, Associate any of us are replaceable at anytime. Including us managers.) Which doesn't quite put you in the best mood to do your best job. All of your co works are great people, and generally nice. Altho it really seemed like I was back in highschool when I was working here, had your teachers (Team leaders) then you had the office attendance (Managers) and a bunch of young/mid-aged adults acting like there 16 and 17, people will flirt, people are segregated to groups during breaks and lunch, (not to mentention you will get in trouble for this aswell), and you got your loners that are there because they have to be. You even got Your  foreigns that don't speak English. Overall I would say its a great first job, but to keep in mind that its not a good place to make a career from. One last thing I was never properly trained on anything until after I had taken the ropes my self and tried  to figure out how to use it, plus you will get in trouble if you don't know how to use it even though, You have never been trained - more...",3,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance ,"Richland, WA",10/31/16,2016,10,31

A very unproductive work place and management wasn't great,Pizzas management wasn't the best management they would often just leave the cook in the kitchen by his or her self.

I liked working inside the pharmacy a lot more then outside on the floor. All the pharmacists were really nice to work with and a learned a bit or two about medicine.

Hard work if employees aren't helping,"Wal-Mart for me included putting out stock and customer service. Without great co-workers the work was harder.

Hard work low pay,"People like Walmart because they pay more than other retail stores slightly. As a sales associate I started off at 11.00. When you work here prepare to work all over the store and do tasks that you didn't see on your job application. While they tell you to do things all over despite in addition to your own department I feel they should increase the pay. I didn't know I needed a lawyer to come with me to look over my employment paper work at Walmart as most of it is in fine print. This location made us do photo lab, online pickups, layaway, push carts, phone activation which takes a long time and time away from helping other customers in your department, put away returns, zones, and restock in other departments EVERY DAY in addition to your department, and were supposed to ring in the front end when the lines get long, alongside the duties in electronics. Management does NOT know anything about any of Walmarts products or services they just know how to walk around the store with each other, flap their gums, and boss people around. This company does not have a good open door policy as management does not care about your concerns because they won't get resolved. They don't greet you or give recognition. They only know you when corporate comes rolling through. They do not respect their employees. The only way to move up is if you suck up to management or they like you it has nothing to do with how hard you work or how long you've been there.",2,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Islandia, NY",10/30/16,2016,10,30
Okay,"Working for Walmart is okay for a first job or something just on the side. The management is okay. Its easy to call out.

It worsened when he told me what I was suppose to do. I couldn't help but notify a day shift worker to help fix an issue with a few panels hitting the fans. And on that same night, the remodeling crew happen to just clean out the shelves on the meat department in the back room.

Management Problems,"The most difficult part of the job was the constant shuffling of management that they forced on us while I worked there. We had no clear line of communication about who our designated assistant manager was, what our tasks were, or how we should perform said tasks. For a few months, we did not have an assistant manager. Our shift (4 A.M. - 1 P.M.) also overlapped the end of the night shift and the beginning of the day shift, meaning we had two sets of managers to respond to every day who wanted different tasks accomplished that almost always conflicted with each other.

Bottom of the Barrel,"It's walmart. You've heard the stories. You've heard the rumors. Take that and add any retail/corporate expereince ever and you have the general gist of it. The worst part of it all really has to be the customers however, as the self prophecy of walmart being a terrible place to work attracts only the desperate and unemployable who have no other choice and are inherently unhappy with the fact they're here. Since customers know these people are not exactly the cream of the crop or are generally unhappy, the customers feel comfortable with treating the employees, and the store, like garbage which exacerbates the problem._x000D__x000D_In short you get people who complain that nobody is smiling and get angry at the people not smiling which, Strangely, doesn't encourage anyone to smile except through bared teeth.

This made our work environment stressful at times and we would often get behind schedule fast.  It would take hours for management to send extra help to finish the unloading the truck/s in an timely manner. Although, the work environment was stressful the employees there were quality people.  The employees made unloading the trucks seem less stressful than it actually was.  Overall, I learned how to stack bulk items and zone water in an orderly manner.

How to operate a baler and a scrubber. The management is well structured. The co-workers vary each day but for the most part are kept to themselves.
