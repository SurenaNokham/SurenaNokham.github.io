Understaffed & overworked ,"There were never enough employees because of the awful scheduling system. If you want to be a cart pusher, get ready to be by yourself most of the time with no help or support. ",2,Former Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Luray, VA",5/14/22,2022,5,14
I enjoyed my work day very nice people,I lost my job because I was very sick and with the Covid restrictions was out for a while I didn’t realize I had to get in touch with another management from about my leave of abscess I feel that it should of been made clear of the next step of my absence I was fired by computer and no one spoke to me about my hiring status,5,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Philadelphia, PA",5/14/22,2022,5,14
Great awesome ,Walmart is a great place to work.  My coworkers never mumbled or talked fast.  The bosses never said you worked too slow when you were actually working hard and quickly no one ever made the bathroom reek   Everyone was so friendly it felt like a big family.  I loved putting food on shelves because it was very rewarding it was like a dream come true.   The parking lot was always real with no garbage or oil stains.  There was always the lovely aroma of cannabis in the air. There was pallets full of boxes of food.  You would put the pallets for your aisle on your aisle then you would scan the stuffin the boxes to find where the stuff goes then you would put the stuff on the shelves where they go,5,Former Employee,Overnight stocker ,"Mount Dora, FL",5/14/22,2022,5,14
Fast pace ,"Fast pace & management don't care if you get your breaks or not. Throughout 5 years of working for Walmart I have had the same experience, and that is not a good one.",3,Current Employee,OGP Walmart ,"Clinton, TN",5/14/22,2022,5,14

Empty Promises ,"Management is just a title. He does nothing but, he does take attendance points off for those that are over the limit. The team leads are just the same. The team leads play favorites. And, if you can put up with the elder employees and their attitudes, I guess you could probably fit in.",3,Current Employee,OGP Associate ,"Kearney, NE",5/14/22,2022,5,14
Need more employees ,Not enough pay rate and some of the management team needs more communication. They also need to give a higher increase of employee discount instead of 10%.,5,Current Employee,Overnight Team Associate ,"Whiteville, NC",5/14/22,2022,5,14

Chasing the shiny red ball constantly. ,"When it's right, it can be a great job. Sadly, it's almost never right. Constant grind. Poor entry level pay, management varies wildly from horrible to great, and the great ones usually don't last long before the company grinds any positive energy out of them. The policies and culture look good on paper but are very unevenly enforced and open to a lot of interpretation. The pay is good at higher management levels but it brings a lot of stress with it. No pension or long term service bonuses. I recommend looking elsewhere.",3,Former Employee,Store Manager ,"Greer, SC",5/14/22,2022,5,14
Terrible management,Management will play favorites and only promote/approve time off for the individuals who kiss their rear. They will also lock you into a schedule that’s outside of your availability and fire you when you call out.,1,Former Employee,Fulfillment Associate ,"Riverview, FL",5/14/22,2022,5,14
Tht I know my job and my co workers in my department we work together ,Walmart is not a bad place to work the only thing I hate is u don’t get no hours there but they always hiring others the company is a great start for u to learn sales but they not fair when it comes to positions and hours they will lie to u until they need u then Thts the only time they will want to give u hours ,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Louisville, MS",5/14/22,2022,5,14

I push carts ,Doesn’t pay well but that’s to be expected. Management leaves me alone as long as I do my job and they are flexible with my school schedule. It’s not the worst place to work if you’re in college. ,4,Current Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Myrtle Beach, SC",5/14/22,2022,5,14

Great pay,"Blatant favoritism makes rules unclear. Coworkers can get you fired based off he said she said evidence.

Former job ,After the first store manager I had it went downhill fast. The department managers had no clue what they were doing. The people I worked with were fun though,2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Wauseon, OH",5/13/22,2022,5,13
"Hard work with good pay, hit or miss with management.","The work can be fairly repetitive, as well as stressful if you find yourself working areas where you aren't comfortable. Recently, Walmart has drastically overhauled it's pay scale, so the pay is good, and worth the hassle of the work.For culture, the majority of coworkers were easy to work with in a team, and fairly friendly. On the other hand, this store is fairly lax in their hiring standards, so a part of the work stress comes from cleaning up after lazy coworkers to do your job correctly. This is compounded by store management tending to ride good workers harder, rather than correcting poor/lazy workers.In the time I worked here, some managers were easy to get along with and provided any help they could in order to facilitate the work, while others were exceptionally high strung and held standards that simply weren't able to be achieved. Still further is a ""good ol' boys"" mentality, with many managers going easy on employees they like, and being impossible to deal with for employees that don't get in their good graces.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Team Associate ,"Yelm, WA",5/13/22,2022,5,13

Not fun ,"I would say that for this company you need to treat your employees better and not treat them like they are just number. ME and couple of my co-workers work hard everyday just be treated badly and I wish they would change that but we all know they won't,  you have people that don't work you are constantly bailing people of their job and sacrificing your job.

Terrible job.,"The management was very abusive, if you weren't a favorite you got treated like trash. You can't call out even if your kid is sick because you can get fired for it, you don't get the benefits they say you will after the time period you're basically in training for. They're incredibly ableist, literally don't work here unless you have to. The 10% off discount doesn't even work on 75%+ of product in the store.",1,Former Employee,Walmart OGP Associate ,"Fredericksburg, VA",5/13/22,2022,5,13
It’s not as bad ,You get to set your own hours that you are available to work on your time but if you can’t work weekends you have to at least work one weekend either Saturday or Sunday but overall it’s okay & work isn’t that hard but sometimes stressful.,4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Mount Pleasant, SC",5/13/22,2022,5,13

It's a Job.,"I worked as a Digital Personal Shopper for Walmart for about a year. The job itself was straightforward and easy to understand, albeit very monotonous at times.

Management,"It’s a do-able job and the pay was definitely worth it. My main problem lies within management. I had 4 Team leads and I would say they were the worst managers I’ve ever had. Not understanding, not encouraging and rude and they treated us like robots. Even though we were understaffed, NONE of the managers jumped in to help us with work. They just spent their whole shifts walking around, watching us and talking/joking around with each other. Maybe it’s just the location but I’ve never had managers talk down at me or treat like trash until I worked at Walmart. All I’ve taken away from my experience at Walmart is them triggering me and having a relapse in my Anxiety and Depression. Thanks Walmart, I appreciate it.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Orem, UT",5/13/22,2022,5,13
Lack of supportive management ,Management is only looking out for their own. Don't bother expecting support or care. They will turn on you on a dime. Corporate policy? Doesn't matter. They make their own policies at this store. ,2,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Corydon, IN",5/13/22,2022,5,13
Fast paced multitasking based workplace ,"Customers were typically pleasant to work with, but management left something to be desired. New employees would not be trained properly and were sometimes left unnatended during training hours. Would be scolded for supposed rule breaking while others actively breaking rules received no punishment. Aside from management, work required was fairly standard and pay was good. But issues with management behavior caused me to leave after only a short period. 6/10",3,Former Employee,Front End Associate ,"Fishkill, NY",5/13/22,2022,5,13

Electronics employee,"Whew, quite an awful place to work. Manage does not care about you one bit. You will be treated awfully from day 1, and your position is easily replaceable.

Nobody ever asked politely it was just barking orders. They claimed to give you benefits after 90days but when it came down to it what they didn’t tell you was employee discount you have to self apply for, health insurance you can’t obtain until open enrollment which is in September October.

"Awful management, grumpy customers, not enough staff",Walmart's philosophy has nothing to do with taking care of customers or staff and everything to do with putting 3-6 persons worth of work on one person's plate. Management always has each other's back and any personal issues like the harassment I experienced are swept under the rug rather than actually acted upon. Constantly understaffed so the customers are never happy. Hated working every day I was there.,1,Former Employee,Worker ,"Atchison, KS",5/13/22,2022,5,13

Toxic unhealthy environment,It's not what you know or how great you are it's who you know and who you're friends with in this company that makes all the difference.

Double standards and manipulation are the most important tools at advancing and staying relevant.,2,Former Employee,Overnight Team Lead ,"Branson, MO",5/13/22,2022,5,13
I love working at Walmart I enjoy working and assisting customers. Unfair management opportunity.,"I am a personal shopper in the pickup department. My day involves prepping and picking orders for our customers, making sure the quality of food and produce is fresh and nice looking. I also on occasion dispense these orders to their vehicles. The chances for management positions are not according to policy and choose who they want for a position versus posting the jobs per company policy,",3,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Van Wert, OH",5/13/22,2022,5,13
Good for basics.,"In my experience, constantly understaffed. They expect a lot from you, no overtime. Depending on locations, a lot of the things you need to successfully do your job will be missing. Would only recommend for people who want to join the auto tech industry. Get your basics here and then leave.",3,Current Employee,Automotive Service Technician ,"Katy, TX",5/13/22,2022,5,13
Turnover,"There is a saying “People don't leave the company. They leave the management.” That applies here at Walmart. The job is fine but the leadership is more “stick” and less “carrot.” so people coming into the store with the bright happy vibes or great work ethic are either put through the wringer or worked to the bone and told, “I know I can rely on you to get this done.”",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Hattiesburg, MS",5/13/22,2022,5,13

You’re just there to get managers their bonuses ,"As the title says, managers and team leads don’t care about you as an individual, they see you as a number on a spreadsheet that’s going to get them their next bonus. Cooperate likes to raise standards constantly but refuses to offer high wages or (at minimum) offer us functional equipment that isn’t taped together or zip tied. This also goes for the work phone that they force us to use (and take home/care of) because they are too cheap to give us TC’s anymore. The phones are slow and half the time don’t work correctly without turning it off 2-3 times in a row. Overall, the phones are a cheap excuse for Walmart to not buy proper equipment for their employees. No amount of “Thankful Thursday's” will make the phones better.. sorry. Overall, if you need somewhere quick to go to make some money to scratch by on bills, this is the place. But don’t expect to fine purpose/meaning in your work or a place to stay long.

The standards change and if you report an issue don't assume anything will be done about it. I had a manager outright tell me they are untouchable and can do what they want. That same manager has told people to come in even on their days off, is dating one of his subordinates and has been reported for favortisum. if you request leave ""its a request"" so it most likely will be denied no matter how long in advance you put it and they do have have taken leave away from people the day before its set to start. i applied for leave 3 months in advance to go to school they tried to have me sighn a letter of resignation to go to school and told me it was LOA .",2,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Nitro, WV",5/11/22,2022,5,11

My store only has 3 team leads to work with (only one per shift) which makes it hard to get any assistance when needed. I started as a cashier and moved up to service desk associate. I was told that there would be a dollar raise with getting that position but that never happened. Instead, I remained at the same base pay as everyone else on front end but had double the work. There’s a lack of employees (as any other job), leaving service desk associates (most of the time) to fill in as “Team lead” for lunches and breaks. So not worth the little pay or stress.

"Not what it used to be, management is a mess","When I started here, I absolutely loved my job, it was easy to feel heard and have an impact on my career.  WFH was such a blessing to most of us and it felt easy to manage work/life balance.  After the merging of Jet.com, it felt like everything changed. Management and offshore tech do not communicate with the team, team managers are hit or miss--each of them running their teams their own way, some have absolutely no clue how to do the same job their agent's do every day, so they can't answer questions.  Team Leads are over loaded so their workload seeps out into SME agent's hands, and they struggled to find time to help the team. Some managers wont speak with you for months, and then come to you with a list of issues that could have been addressed in monthly promised one-on-one's.  Communication in general is an all out nightmare.Everyone was so stressed and overwhelmed, mandatory OT would be implemented suddenly leaving agents overworked and exhausted.  The town hall meetings with management, where we were supposed to feel like we could ask questions were taken over by higher ups making jokes and unnecessary commentary for most of the time allotted.  And when agents did finally get space to speak, they would bring up valid concerns and inquiries about work issues, only to often be insulted and belittled.  Treated like inferiors who ""didn't understand the business"".Walmart needs to remember where it's backbone is, these ""small employees"" hold up your entire company.

However, coworkers will act like they are your boss also, even if they have been there a month longer than you have.

Be ready to be lectured about the same mistakes repeatedly even if you move to the section and have a unput that existed before you got there. Sometimes you will be swamped if there are over 100 trailers on the lot.  However,  if workload is dead you could get sent home or to another area to help.  You are expected to sweep and wait for unput reports before you leave for the day. The building is very dusty and you will get dirty. There are break rooms and it turns out they are air conditioned.

Consistent and Monotonous ,"Back when I worked there as a cashier, work was pretty monotonous. The job was the same every day. The only thing that really changed was the people who came through the lines. You know, the stereotypes exist for a reason. Sometime, when work was slow, you might be asked to help with returns, and on the rare occasion, fill-in in another department. I think the most useful skills I managed to pick up were the ability to interact with new people, and the ability to use a keypad efficiently. I know management had issues, but the head cashiers insulated us from any drama that occurred. I didn't really feel any connection to the company as an employee, and didn't get to know many people. As a cashier you weren't supposed to socialize with your co-workers. You were expected to stay in your lane and look busy, always. The thing I disliked the most about the job was that you had to stand in place for hours at a time. By the end of the week my feet would be so sore and stiff that when I would wake up I would have to hobble 50 feet before I could walk normally again. I highly recommend getting a floor position If you want to work for this company. I really enjoyed the brief moments where I was able to  connect with customers.

"Pay is great, schedule isn’t the best","Job is very stressful most days. Not fully staffed, cutting hours so other associates and managers have to pick up the slack.

Rather easy job goes by quickly,"Working here as a nightshift stocker is fine. The nights go by quickly and I can zone out majority of the shift without worry of not getting done. Management usually can be very helpful and are kind, but on heavy nights and you're behind it's 50/50 if they'll get you help.

Its a good starter job,Walmart is a great place to work for your first job. You learn a lot and you always have something to do no matter which department you work in. Me personally I had no problems working there but i do think that the pay could be higher. Mainly cashiers because they deal with people all day but get the lowest pay. Overall Walmart has the potential to be a better company but they just need to put the play in motion!,4,Former Employee,Digital Personal Shopper ,"Union County, SC",5/9/22,2022,5,9

Fast paced & don’t care about their employees ,This is perfect for you if you’re in school or have other things to do during the day. Pay is not super great but better then most minimum wage jobs. They expect a lot out of you and want things done within their time limit. Even if it’s impossible they will threaten to fire you or make you feel bad about yourself. Some managers are rude and unorganized. They will tell you to do something. Then ask why you aren’t doing something else. You get an hour break and two on the clock 15 minute breaks. And god forbid you lose a family member that’s not “ immediate”. They don’t care. And will give you a hard time when trying to get days off. ,3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Dallas, TX",5/9/22,2022,5,9

Super Toxic work environment,"I worked for this company for 13 years. Started as a cashier and worked my way up to Coach. There is absolutely no work/life balance on any level. You are made to feel guilty for saying no. If you are not a member of ""the good ol boys"" club it takes an act of God to get a decent raise or promotion. You are expected to do more with significantly less resources. This company treatment of its associates has declined so rapidly. You cannot just throw money at them. There is no respect for the individual as they claim. Front End associates get it the worst from customers and yet they are paid the least. They are not promoting from withing much anymore either.

Well-paying yet micro-managed company. Not sure the pay makes up for the multiple cons involved. ,"The pay is excellent for the mindless work you do. Long hours,  no earbuds allowed. You come in and do your job, with minimal interaction with coworkers, and a dirty atmosphere. Slow times first 4- 5 months of the year which translates into not enough hours. Due to the number of employees - you are treated like a number. Very micromanaged and production-based. Hard on your body.

Productive and tiring workplace,"It's a good place to start as your first job, you learn about the fast paced work culture and have good benefits.

",4,Former Employee,Merchandise Stocking ,"Charlotte, NC",5/9/22,2022,5,9
Management needs training in how to communicate with employees,"The work is steady and the day goes by quickly. However, the management speaks to employees like they are ignorant and raises their voices on the sales floor in front of customers and other associates. They are one of the higher paying companies and benefits are reasonable. They do not care about their associates and see them as dispensable, usually higher for part-time so they do not have to give sufficient hours or benefits.

Just ok,"Ogp is a okay job, a lot of lifting and a lot of walking. If you’re organized  it’s the place for you.

Overall,"They don't care about the employees or the customers. They care about money. They pay you the min. And expect you to help the jobs of management.

New pay is nice but it isn't worth it. ,"Too many middle managers with anger issues that like to play favorites and single out anyone who stands up for themselves. They no longer respect your availability and cut both full time and part time worker hours.

I had a great experience working there. I learned telephone etiquette. The workplace culture, there are lots of amazing and nice individuals who work there. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain your composure when someone was having a rough day and being impolite to an associate. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is helping out customers with disabilities, talking to them when they are having a rough day and overall just talking to them.

But i constantly found myself saying Walmart did not know the difference from their front to their back.  And once i moved up into management i started seeing some shady things. At Walmart you are overworked and underpaid and not appreciated. It’s a trickle down effect so i believe the problem starts with the corporate staff sitting at their desks with no real clue as to what really is going on in the stores.I’m grateful for the friends i made and the skills i learned because they have been transferable in the medical field.It’s easy to feel stuck here but if you like working nights, weekends, and holidays and don’t mind feeling like you have no purpose or the need to feel valued… then this might just be the place for you.",2,Former Employee,People Lead ,Kansas,5/6/22,2022,5,6

Being sick means nothing to them regardless of your situation.  My HR person is one of the most desensitized individuals I've ever met and has zero empathy for any situation.

When it came time for my break, I got wrote up for not being in my area,  often times I would wait 10-15 minutes for permission to go... eventually when no relief would come, I simply went anyway.

The work is easy but often fast paced and stressful ,"Overall the job isn’t the worst or the best out there. The work is fairly easy to learn and is repetitive. You get a small sense of self importance knowing you are making sure people are receiving the medication they need. There are decent sign-on bonuses, there is a lack of techs so you have pretty good job security. Walmart definitely offers the best pay, work environment and benefits compared to other retail pharmacies. They will reimburse you for getting your license, you can start out as a cashier and work your way up to getting your license.  The bad side of the job usually revolves around the patients, if the store you work at gets a lot of bad apples then work tends to be very stressful, another note is higher ups pushing for more numbers that seem far fetched. The pay is not as high as it should be for having to deal with all the stress and problematic customers. In-store shoppers get paid equal or if not more than you will make here.

"It was a fun job but management was trash , showed favorites and respected high out of you even tho they mistreated you ","Pay is decent, but not worth the bs from management , if I had a choice id rather work factory work then Walmart ,they expect so much out of you or they complain, management will coach you for anything and yell at you to move faster but they actually are slow themselves ",1,Former Employee,Stocker/Customer Service ,"Mount Vernon, OH",5/5/22,2022,5,5
It is a fun place to work. No day is ever the same. Always something new happening at Walmart,"I loved working there and WOULD DEFINITELY GO BACK if given the chance. Like all jobs you have your good and bad day and can be stressful at times s but overall its a whole lot of fun.

"Good place to work, but pay was lacking","Walmart is a pretty decent place to work with good advancement opportunities, but there's a discrepancy in pay between departments.

"Lots of opportunities for growth, with great pay & benefits.","I started working there during March 2020. There was alot of work, because of covid.Worked 11 hour days, 6 days a week, but it decreased back to normal around the end of the year, to 4 days a week.Pay was great! Started around $16 & increased to $20+ within a year. Quarterly bonuses are also given.There's alot of great benefits too!!!You can also take High school & college courses & get different types of job certifications for FREE.I got alot of experiance there by being able to work in various departments & in different positions. Like packing, picking & shipping, & being an employee trainer, &  area exceptions clerk.Management was very chill. Both area managers & team leads are willing to help you succeed. With that being said, you are expected to make rate ( aka: meet production requirements) and if not met, you will be written up and eventually terminated if you're constantly not making rate. Overall if you're looking for a great paying job or a place to grow or start a career after college, this is a great company for that.",5,Former Employee,"Trainer, exceptions clerk, production employee ","Plainfield, IN",5/5/22,2022,5,5

Great place to work as long as it is staffed correctly.,"Walmart is a great place to interact with customers. It gives you a sense of pleasure to be able to help someone. I was an overnight stocker. The only problems I endured in my employment there was understaffing. Since the pandemic it has been hard to keep employees. This had a trickle down effect on other workers because the work still needed to be completed no matter how many workers were there. Many areas were designed to have more than one worker working it but, there just wasn't enough help. This is where my issues with company progressed. However, the pay for what you do there as a stocker was great and their benefits are awesome.",3,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Emporia, VA",5/5/22,2022,5,5

Mostly awful,"I worked on the Overnight Stock ""Team"". At the time,, around 2015, a  member of Management would make stupid comments in front of employees...such as ""Go ahead and quit, you'll be replaced right away"". Some employees were idiots because they would share personal b*ullshit in the break room. Some thought they were in charge and can be assh*oles. I almost told one of them off.It was a very unpleasant experience",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Palm Harbor, FL",5/5/22,2022,5,5

High expectations for low pay ,Basically they want you to run to keep up with production. Just make production. Whatever you do just get the product out.

Unhappy work environment ,Fast paced. Some days are longer some shorter but mostly on the longer side now. If you don't want to hit standards for the day be prepared to be working about 11 11 1/2 hours. Always told its a team environment but it's everyone for themselves.

"Better than slinging burgers, but that's a low bar to clear","To start, the work itself wasn't all that bad. You pick stuff up and put it down, zone the shelves, etc.But of course, this is Walmart.As part of orientation/training, we had to watch an indoctrinati-sorry, ""educational"" video about how bad unions are. We were perpetually understaffed. I was often assigned nightly tasks that required a high amount of hours and several people working them to complete within the time frame they wanted (15, 30, 40 hour tasks). I'd tell the manager on that night that I needed backup to get it done in time, and they would promise to assign more people over to help me. Rarely would said backup ever come. We were always behind and management would chide us for it. As if it were our fault that Walmart couldn't retain employees. Management was a mixed bag. Two of the overnight managers were very nice and reasonable people, and I was happy to go above and beyond for them, the others not so much. One night, one of the new stockers messed up a task, and the manager on that night SCREAMED at them and then punished them by making them put all the shopping carts in the parking lot away by themselves, on an insanely hot and humid summer night. Totally unprofessional.Quite a few of my coworkers who had been working at Walmart for a number of years complained about cut hours, whereas I as a new employee pretty much always had a full 40 hours and then some. Pretty suspect.The most enjoyable part of the job was the solitude, I'd listen to music and podcasts all night. Unsure if this is still allowed.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Central Square, NY",5/5/22,2022,5,5

Your coworkers make it or break it ,"In general, the coworkers are the best part of working at Walmart. The management in stores I've experienced has been awful. Zero effective communication between members of management, and little empathy from said managers. When an issue comes up (illness, disability, family crisis, etc) they will not have your back and will let you know just how replaceable you are. They do discriminate and retaliate against you for using their open door policy as well when you encounter harassment. ",2,Former Employee,Held Various Positions ,"Galax, VA",5/5/22,2022,5,5

Good first job. Not worth more than a couple years of your time. ,Easy job but managers apply too much pressure and overwork their best associates while being extra lenient towards their lesser associates. Managers are ultimately promoted due to favoritism. You can be one of the best workers and unfortunately will never receive a promotion simply because you are just too valuable as a regular associate. ,3,Former Employee,Associate ,"South Gate, CA",5/4/22,2022,5,4
Awful management ,Changed around my position without matching my pay to those positions. Impossible to get into contact with hr. They promised me 4 days off for a vacation that I already had paid.

Work too many positions for too little pay,"They employ the unqualified. They also keep the absolute minimum amount of workers to run the store while paying you minimum wage. So you end up working other departments, constantly. These other departments also make more money but they keep you at your base wage. If you have medical issues of any kind, they do not care. You are a liability. Store manager was great but the lower management was atrocious. The entire time I was there I was overworked, underpaid, dismissed, reprimanded for doing what the company required but not what management required, undermined, and unencouraged. This place did more damage to my mental and physical health than any job should. ",2,Former Employee,Firearms Associate ,"Weirton, WV",5/3/22,2022,5,3

Good starting job,"A typical day of work at Walmart, especially being front-end services, is to check in with your manager. You are told to go to a place and most of the time for me, I would be subbing in for another position due to understaffing. When I was working my actual job I loved it but I find it sad that the biggest employer in the world cannot find the associates to keep the customer and employees happy. We get benefits like 10% off certain merchandise and free Walmart plus. The culture of the workplace feels heavily divided between management and hourly.

Walmart is a fairly easy place to work. The work load isn't much and I got paid well for what I was doing.

The job is what you make it,You can grow with the company if you so choose. You can go from cart pushing all the way to store manager and more. The kicker is if you have no intention of moving up you realize you aren't cared about and are nothing but a number. You will see new associates come in making near or even more than you even if you been there 15+ years. Long term associates aren't paid for their dedication or knowledge if you aren't looking to move up it's not for you.

The market manager as well as company restructuring was horrible. ,Walmart used to be a wonderful place to work but because of restructuring of all departments there is no longer any ownership within the store. Instead of having 1 department to manage you now have 2 or more departments that you share with other hourly managers and associates. As far as work life balance forget it! You might work 5-2 one day and 1-10 the next vice versa. The market manager treats there managers poorly as well.

Even though you're a hard worker, if you happen to miss more than 4 days in a 6 month period you're probably going to be fired, no matter how short staffed the department is. For the work that OPD does, they are severely underpaid. Deli/bakery is starting at 15.50, while OPD makes 13.

Worked Hard and extremely underpaid ,"I worked for a Walmart Distr.

work somewhere else,I was the most depressed I’ve been in a long time while working at this company. There was little to no room for advancement or improvement. I was constantly asked to do odd jobs around the store that were someone else’s job with no regard to whatever goals were originally set for me.  There was no respect for my time and energy. ,2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Tiffin, OH",5/2/22,2022,5,2

Horrible Management ; No appreciation ,"Worst job I’ve had so far honestly. I really love my coworkers but management is horrible. They never help, always bark orders and people, never compliment or reassure their employees like it’s like they literally only comment on negative things on the job. They show strong favoritism so certain employees that clearly shows. We’ve literally been through 7 crews since I started last year because people quit because of how things are.",1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Wilmington, NC",5/2/22,2022,5,2

Everyone was very pleasant.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"O'Fallon, MO",5/2/22,2022,5,2

Management could be better ,For the amount I'm getting paid it's not worth the stress cause I know I am worth so much more than 16 dollars an hour. The hours aren't steady not enough to try to be living off and there are no overtime opportunities ,3,Current Employee,Associate ,"American Canyon, CA",5/2/22,2022,5,2
Productive and fast paced,Working at the distribution center was pretty cool because of the pay and benefits. They hire pretty fast and start you on a curve so you can get used to the job. Working in the freezer is the easiest if you can handle the cold. Can make incentive for pulling over 100% and if you actually try to do it you can do it pretty easy. Being an order filler is like playing Tetris all day. Once you get that down you’ll be good.,4,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Casa Grande, AZ",5/1/22,2022,5,1
You are just a tool,"Management doesn’t care about the people, there only focus is that product is stocked. You could be the hardest, fastest and most skilled worker on the shift and your work ethic won’t be good enough. You’ll go and do the best work and they’ll expect twice that.

Worst place to ever work,"Literally run. Just don't work here. Everything about working at Walmart sucks. Management was poor.

Do not apply if you have a life outside of work. come friends with leaders.,Walmart has a 200% turnover rate for a reason. Its about who you know not what you do.

Management is not worth it.,As a manager the amount of hours you work greatly supersedes what you are getting paid. It's a burnout job. You end up spending more time at work than you do off. When inventory time comes you will be working non-stop.,3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Philadelphia, PA",5/1/22,2022,5,1

Poor Management and Work Environment ,"I have worked at the neighborhood Walmart for almost a year now, and every day I am met with managers who do not know how to talk to their associates nor do they care about their associates. I love my job but my managers are running me away because the lack of care is so great that it makes me not want to come into work at all.

Walmart is great ,Overall Walmart has a great foundation with people that care and want best for you. It’s not the easiest to move up but only because people have tenure there and have been there for awhile. The worst part about the job is the one or two mean customers a week we would get. Other than that minor things like I felt unattended to at times from managers and staff because it would get too busy. ,4,Former Employee,Front end checkout TA ,"Boerne, TX",5/1/22,2022,5,1

You can seek out fellow employees with similar interest. I do enjoy talking to the regular customers.,"I've worked for Walmart twice before at the same location.

Wouldn't recommend to no one,Have overnight management stop sleeping in their office and stop treating there employees like garbage. Get rid of the lazy people that don't work instead of giving the people that do work extra work and giving them hard times when they can't finish and the lazy people just paid for showing up.

Pays well. ,"The jobs pays well, but management can be lazy. If you’re used to being a working manager, this is the job for you. Only drawback is when managers don’t pull their weight.

Training is poor,"I was a training manager at my prior job. I never felt so lost and would NEVER let one of my trainees feel this way. There was never any structure or one on one training from my direct boss or anyone else for that matter. I like setting goals and achieving them. I never felt I had the support to progress and succeed. Constantly feel like I’m their whipping boy when their days didn’t go as planned. Constantly getting the death stares and death glares and yelled at for someone else not performing correctly. I am not saying all Walmarts are this way. But the one I left my stable, successful position for was a nightmare. Walmart is you are reading this. Please do better.

Accountability issues,"It’s a stepping stone job. Unless you are a student or retiree, you really shouldn’t be working at Walmart. Any meaningful promotions will result in you being sent to a different store which could be in a different town or even state.Most co-workers do the bare minimum to get by because if you ever go “above and beyond” you will be the first one chosen to pick up someone else’s slack. Hard work is not rewarded. In fact, everyone gets the same 2% raise once a year which barely covers inflation.Management are fine as people, but there is an accountability issue. No one wants to punish poor performance and as long as workers don’t get called out, they will continue to do as little as possible to get by and get away with what they can.If you are looking for a career at Walmart, just get ready to wedge yourself into the managers clique and try to get to know the right people.

It's a job that paid the bills. Do the bare minimum to avoid burnout. ,"This is a fast-paced environment where multitasking is required, especially when short staffed. You must feel comfortable working closely with your team. This is a job where each person has to pull their own weight; you'll feel it when you have to pick up the slack of certain workers at times who do the bare minimum. I wish I just did the bare minimum because going above and beyond meant getting more work with no increase in pay. Most of the time, it feels like you're bouncing from one area to another, which is great if you like the day to fly by. From my experience working here, not everyone was willing or interested in training the new people, which can make it hard to keep a team fully staffed. Yes, training people is not easy, but it is a NECESSITY and crucial because you depend on your team members on just about everything. Overall, you'll be learning a lot as go. Invest in some good shoes. Keep your head up. When in doubt, ask questions. The people you work with can make or break your experience. And don't go above and beyond or you'll burn out like me.

I was training new people from the ground up and me and a few coworkers were responsible for half of the store while they had 10+ people on the other side.

Be prepared to also deal with employees that do 1/100 the work as you and don’t get fired bc they are nice to the management. Also Walmart constantly changes things and most things get worse.

Most of management and Team Leads are disorganized and unprofessional.,"You learn as you go since either your Team Lead didn't receive training for certain tasks or they assume you know everything and won't train you unless you bug them nonstop. Team leads are hit or miss, 2/4 of my leads were cooperative and respectful towards their department, while 1/4 often humiliated you in front of customers and management and the newest Team lead at the time transferred from another store, showed up for three shifts and then never came back. The job itself is easy to understand with proper instruction, lots of movement and lifting. Amount of work depends on your shift, who calls out, and how much work your team is able to finish. Morning shifts routine started with freight (My average was 4-8 pallets), Picks/CAP, Zoning walls and tables throughout the entire department, returns, setting mods and changing endcaps, and working Fitting room and jewelry when assistance is needed. Depending on the amount of freight, you'll get sent over to another department to do their freight either in a group or by yourself. Afternoon and Night shift was mostly working on returns, working jewelry and Fitting room, zoning, and setting mods and changing endcaps. Depending on your Team leader, you might not get your break/s or lunch on time or at all, while others are often asking whenever or not you have taken your break or lunch.

Good schedule and organized but not a good pay rate for the work,I would work 7-4 very consistent hours so the schedule and hours was there but I would have to do so much work for only 11 an hour in my opinion it’s not a very fair pay compared to other retail stores paying 15 an hour for the same or less work,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Houston, TX",4/28/22,2022,4,28
"Good pay. Bad management. For me, it wasn't worth it.","Good pay. Bad, semi-abusive, and lazy management. They do half the work the rest of us do and make twice as much in wages. You will receive no training, you have to figure it all out on your own. Was happy on the remodel team while that was going on but afterward, they wouldn't put me into the job I desired. No explanation was offered. Many of the people I worked with didn't speak English so I had to do a lot of their job for them.Overall, it can be easy money when you figure it out.

Worst management I've ever seen.,"Job is easy. Pay is decent. Coworkers? Some are rude, but the others are amazing. Management? Absolutely terrible. They treat their employees like dirt. They scold them like dogs for everyone to see, belittle them, and do not care if you work hard. They get an attitude with you when there is not enough equipment for you to do your job when it is their responsibility to ensure they have enough equipment. They fail to properly train new associates on what to do when there are no picks, then get angry at them for not doing something. If you've learned what to do when there are no picks, and you go do those things, they get angry with you and say you aren't doing your job. And don't try to go to the restroom because you aren't doing your job then either. If you're a hard worker, just don't waste your time here. They put the employees that are the worst on a pedestal. I've never been treated so poorly by management. I've never had my work ethic questioned until I worked here. And I've never seen so much favoritism of lazy employees in my life.

If you are apart of the LGBTQIA+ community I wouldn’t even apply here everyone is so judgmental and hateful it’s exhausting.

Team working makes the Dreams come true ,Team working makes Dreams Working.  The Swarming way of stocking and tag teams to get work done quickly and efficiently works.

Decent work life balance but terrible management,"Basically the title.

Stressful and not flexible ,"Store manager doesn’t know how to run a store. They don’t hire enough people and they put pressure on everyone too heavily to the point people quit. If you work in a department like Lawn and Garden or Sporting Goods especially, you will get pulled to do everyone else’s work and later on get yelled at for not working in your own department.There are really only mainly 3 shifts to work:1 Morning (usually 5-2pm)2 Evening (1-10pm and 2-11pm)Not super willing to work with your schedule after you’re hired, good luck. High stress environment especially if you work in a service area, (like Customer Service, Sporting Goods, paint counter, fabric counter, electronics, etc.)Management is also not the greatest. Mainly because of the store manager. The other managers are more willing to work with you, but if you’re not “good” with them they will hold grudges and not work with you. Managers also do not communicate with other managers very well, so one will tell you to do something and then half an hour later another will tell you another thing. (Can get you in trouble.)If you apply and want days off I’d advise to schedule those days off in advance (way in advance.)Would like to also advise they have a point system. 5 points and you’re out. Miss 1 whole day with calling in (and not using ppto/pto) = 1 pointMiss 1 whole day w/o calling in = 1 pointMiss 1 whole day w/o calling in and it’s a holiday = 2 pointsLate and call it in = .5 points5 points can add up faster thank you may think.

decent place to work but not forever,Worked under an excellent manager but was often expected to work overtime and in departments that I was not hired for. My gripe is that they literally make you run through the store collecting things to get better times as I was required to complete both my own duties and help customers within a time limit. Other managers also constantly micromanaging and when you cannot do every single thing they ask and more they act like you are an inconvenience. ,3,Former Employee,Ship from Store Associate ,"Idaho Falls, ID",4/27/22,2022,4,27

Walmart displays poor communication between staff and goals,"As a department manager, we have daily prices changes, and merchandise to place out, modular resets.

In store management can be lazy and misguided. There is a high turnover rate at 87% of it location. Hourly and salary raises are wack.

Management is awful. There was almost ZERO teamwork. Nobody really cares about doing the job the right way.,"I worked in OGP... Management only has one thing in mind: Bonuses. They will work you as hard as they can and push you to your limits until you've had enough. The majority of the coworkers are lazy, they don't do the job right even if they've been there for years, and when you notify management about mistakes that need fixing, they say they'll address it but never do. Nothing ever changes for the better, only for worse. It all boils down to management, they simply don't manage. I was told for years that things would change and it didn't. They forced us to take on as many Online Grocery orders as we could, more than that would even fit in our dedicated space... Not enough space, not enough equipment, not enough people who cared.

Walmart can be a good place to start your working career for the future. You can also make a career out of working for Walmart. ,There's so much to do everyday that the time flies by. Things can change quickly when people call out and your day could be totally different than you thought it would be when you come in. You could even be in a department you know nothing about. You could end up being maintenance if needed to helping unload a truck 🚛. You never know!!,3,Former Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Merritt Island, FL",4/23/22,2022,4,23

Bad managment,"Its about what you expect at a retail job. Coworkers are generally cool people, but management is incompetent. The company does not provide you the tools or the manpower to do most of your tasks",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Buena Park, CA",4/22/22,2022,4,22
Pretty bad depending on the department you get but the stress will get you,Really dislike how most managers and teem leads get normal bottom paid associates to take care of most departments on their own just to go to a corner to talk for couple hours till break or lunch while the associates have mental breakdowns because they have everything put on their shoulders without being taught most of their job and that's not all of it but I'll leave it at that.,4,Current Employee,E commercial shopper ,"Sylacauga, AL",4/22/22,2022,4,22

"The job wasn't too bad, could've been much better","I worked in cap fresh produce as a stocker, my supervisor was really good as well as my coworkers, we all got along pretty well. At the time that I worked there the managers had tendency to just walk around the store micro-managing but as time went on the store manager stepped up and put and end to that. My job wasn't very difficult at all, I'd say the hardest part was the CVP at the end of the night. The reason I say this is because CVP involved going around two of the departments within that area and marking down items that were set to expire the next day. Depending on the day there could be hundreds of items and only one person to work those two departments and you had all of 2 hours to do it. A good thing I can say is the pay wasn't too bad, I was making 11.50 an hour at the time but I know it has gone up now. The hour long lunch break was also really nice especially considering the deli was right there in the store along with a subway so you could get food quick if you didn't bring any.

Always changing ,"It takes six months till you can promotes, and anyone can promote if they have an understanding with the job and can work wl as a team member. However if you are looking to be compensated for years of hard work and dedication. It's not worth it I have seen people quit after three years and come back six months later get paid better then some one who has had a good review and pay raise. The environment feels like you have a great work family and friends forever but in the end it's your over worked self against the company that just expects more if you don't know how to say no and even then if someone beats you to asking for time off and they have hours it doesn't matter that you never miss a day or have worked through the year if you ask to late you don't get it. Also this is not for the weak minded its constant from management to the customer demanding things you can not control.

Some really awesome coworkers but not worth the pay,You will meet some really awesome co-workers working at the store but you also run into a lot of people that just do not care about doing their job. You will be expected to do so many things at one time that it will become impossible for you to get everything done. You're expected to get done a whole list of items given to you by your lead and they don't put into that list of things that you still need to do customer service for everyone that is shopping so they will hold it against you if you do not get everything done that they asked even if the store is beyond busy and customers are constantly needing assistance. The pay is just not enough to start out. Raises are about $0.20 every year and some people get a raise randomly but it's not the entire store it goes by a certain group of people and sometimes you will qualify for it but you still won't get it. Shifts are not very flexible and it's hard to get your days off assigned to you. Also be warned if you are sick as you would think it's customer service so you literally cannot get anyone sick and can't go into work they will hold it a very much against you if you're going to be out a couple days put in for a leave of absence you will be unpaid but based on their PTO and ppto rate that you gain I recommend a leave of absence Five Points and they will fire you.,3,Former Employee,Lawn & Garden Associate ,"Coal Township, PA",4/21/22,2022,4,21

The store manager was only concerned about the store's alcohol collection and neglected all other areas and tasks, Front End associates were expected and required to pick up the slack of other departments while still maintaining the Front End and being paid the lowest rate in the store, the Team Leads would often have their associates doing their jobs and enjoyed pitting them against one another and others in different departments, and management frequently showed favoritism to those who did what they were told unquestioningly and often abused the company's points system in order to fire those that did not stand for their abuse.

Typical Corperate company,"Top mgt. has little regard for those under them. This last month they have taken access to tools needed to efficiently do our job in this department. However, Our Team leads are fantastic and are very helpful. The Upper mgt could care less about those working under them.

It’s a good job,I work on the health and wellness side of Walmart and it’s actually pretty decent. Main thing to focus on to keep your job is to just not miss more than the allowed time to miss work.

It is what you make it.,"Walmart is successful as a collective for a reason. They produce markets and locations like they were a Big Mac. They always need employees. There are benefits that perhaps the old grocery store didn’t have. These are positives. Being exposed to a wide variety of skill sets, departmental training, customers, co-workers, retail philosophy, and customer service are additionally life altering. In these ways it is a wonderful company.Now the negative. Money, money, money. Basic business ideas- control spending on product, control labor, price based around cost+returns on prices, pass savings to consumers where possible, and an overall focus on P&L’s. In this way Walmart begins to fail based on the individual. Wages are stagnant. But there is job security. Benefits exist but they are hardly comprehensive. Work-life balance is atrocious even for management. Stress becomes so entwined in your daily life that those small benefits mean life or death.If you stay principally sound it can be amazing. But if it starts minimizing your happiness or health it will continue degradation faster than seemingly possible.In conclusion, Walmart is what you make of it. Clichéd? Yes. But true. The House always wins. Especially if it is the House of Walton.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Lexington, KY",4/19/22,2022,4,19

During my time working there I’ve had nothing but rude managers that talk behind your back, somehow accumulated multiple late strikes despite having near perfect attendance and several people at the higher parts of Walmart siding with the store instead of making things right simply because the ones involved are good at making the store money. A horrible place to work, very toxic environment, with very few workers that actually care about others, there are a few but not many . On top of everything they use cleaning as a means to get people to quit, they claim that “everyone at Walmart is cleaning” but they only get workers they don’t like to clean, and they do it one at a time to try and make associates angry. Store is very dirty some of the carts haven’t been cleaned for months, food is often found open or discarded. Would think twice before applying here again.",1,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Middletown, DE",4/18/22,2022,4,18

The company doesn't care about emoyees,Walmart has cut everyone's hours without warning and has unfairly given some hours while refusing others. I have a disability and they refuse to accommodate that. They gave me what I asked for at first then said unless imoved departments I would get no hours .I had to beg to move departments and they still made  it difficult for me. It's not a good environment to work in. Management plus corporate doesn't care about employees. Don't apply there.,2,Current Employee,Apparel Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Somerset, KY",4/18/22,2022,4,18
I would believe everything I hear about Walmart.,Im in awe that Walmart does not lose more money with how incompetent management and Home Ofice it.

Management not well trained. ,"I worked there for 5 years. They are constantly hiring because the job culture is horrible. Management is poorly trained. If a lower level manager tries to do a good job, new information comes from corporate or the store manager that makes the job worse. It slowed us down and made things harder instead of just letting us do our jobs. People who don't understand the job decide how it should be done. There is a great deal of favoritism. The actual management of people is designed to scare and harass instead of encourage and train. I actually did a good job, so I didn't get a lot of bad treatment, but they punish rather than help or train. This is why turnover is so high. One of the key expectations is ""respect for the individual."" No, it is not there. At all. ",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Rochester, NH",4/18/22,2022,4,18
There are better places out there nowadays,I worked CAP 2 at Walmart for about 6 months. It was an OK starter job but it did result in a pretty nasty knee injury. There's a lot of physical labor and other stores pay better.,1,Former Employee,CAP 2/Cashier ,"La Crosse, WI",4/18/22,2022,4,18
you are worth so much more,"I worked there from January 2022 until March 2022, and it was until March that I was told it was a temporary position, the job was set to end April 1, 2022, but I left early because I wasn't receiving my entire check. so, I was putting in hard labor but receiving half checks. also, there were no benefits (unless we were actual employees to the store like stockers or checkout associates) and you never get the full orientation, only the job description, name tag, a number, and then you're out the door until your first start day. we were told that we were not able to receive pto (paid time off) only ppto which was confusing, and the management sucked very hard. I wouldn't recommend working here, you are worth more. unless the store is in another city or state. hope this helps!",1,Former Employee,Overnight Remodel ,"Enterprise, AL",4/18/22,2022,4,18

Very quick response to get an interview and took about a week for orientation but after that you’re set. Everything is pretty easy but there’s a lot they don’t tell you so definitely be ready to be asking questions A LOT.

It's Walmart,"I've worked at several locations in the pharmacy. It is chronically understaffed and the pharmacists are over worked. At the store level, I've been happy with my coworkers, but upper management clearly doesn't care about patient health and safety beyond how it can make money for the company.

Big loss on hourly managers,Walmart was a great company until they decided to go to teams.

It got easier to keep track of their med files.On the other hand, the pharmacy was usually complete chaos whenever a tech called in and left us short staffed.

Not a bad place to work overall ,The best area to work in my opinion is the receiving area. Walmart customers can be quite demanding so working in the back room helps with that. I always got enough hours but taking time off for it having to call out for an emergency was always looked down upon. Walmart wants you to be at work no matter what and that is just not possible having kids. Things happen that and Walmart could be more understanding of those situations.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier/Stocker ,"Lafayette, LA",4/18/22,2022,4,18
This is not a good company too work.,This job doesn't care about anything but getting the job done. They don't train you too do the job correctly. They dont care if family emergency come up. If you dont have PTO saved you will be getting points regardless if its life threatened. They need too change there rules on how they run there company. After 5 points you will be fired no matter what. I had too go in the hospital and i let them know that i was in there also bring a note from the hospital.

"Bad team leads, bad management","Was so excited to come out of retirement to work a little. Wow, was I disappointed, the management has no clue that if you belittle an employee in front of a customer, said customer will also have no respect. Duh. Team leads are more like team ""I don't do anything all day except talk down to my team, and get paid to do it."" I resigned after two days, I observed quite a bit, in order for your employees to have respect for you, have some in return. You want big stars and ratings? Lol. The customers are observers too.

Management does not set you up for success ,The job itself is not hard and the pay is pretty good for a retail job. The problems are with the way management runs the store.

Had one Asset Protection Manager taking my parts from receiving and hiding them or trashing them. Escalted to direct manager and upper management but they dont care. Just go out there and save them money from a third party repair. Make you wait 90 days for insurance but drop it the day you resign. Associatte discount card is a joke.

Management is awful,"Management is the downfall of this company (or maybe just this store) . They make the job so stressful and belittle us all. Nothing is EVER enough. Their attitudes resemble that of high school gossips and their habit of playing favorites and talking to us like we are idiots are issues  that nearly every coworker of mine has a problem with as well. On top of that, the amount of work that they expect to be completed during one shift is unreasonable and the harder you work to meet this goal, the worse they end up treating you. They’ll use the excuse of, “ Well, I know you’re capable of doing twice as much as ‘ enter lazy coworker’s  name here’ , so I expect more”. Yet, those lazy coworkers are often paid the same or better for doing half the work and then they receive special treatment in other areas as well.  It’s so frustrating.  The ones that have never put forth much effort never have much expected of them and they get a pass on doing maybe 40% of what the rest of us do. Then there’s all of the policy changes that the company has made regarding pay, time off, bonuses, etc. Especially over the last few years. Little by little they’ve taken away a lot!

Overall 2.8/5,"Our Walmart is considered the ""it"" store. We have corporate always visiting us and they test out new ideas on our Walmart. Our store makes A LOT of money and OGP is the department that makes the most. It's because of this that we have an enormous amount of pressure thrown on us. I initially wanted to work at Walmart because of how laid back I thought it was. Well, it's not laid back anymore. People in other departments are basically chilling compared to OGP. I have a lot of respect for stockers though. They've been micro-managing us a lot lately. They refuse to give us the tools we need in order for us to do our jobs. We never have enough TCs and half of our carts are broken. Most of our dollies are broken too but they're still usable. You would think that our store, which makes an average of $380,000 a day, would be able to get us new carts and more TCs. They expect us to be actual robots. I kid you not they wanted the personal shoppers to go into the backrooms and search for the items if it's not on the shelf. Keep in mind our picks are all timed and if you take too long it kicks you out. They wanted us to call our team leads for each individual item we can't find. They also wanted us to keep a high pick rate of over 120 while keeping up with our orders before the next drop. Wegetting stopped all the time by customers to try and help them too.I met some cool people working here, but the work itself sucks. The wages definitely aren't a reflection of their expectations.

Challenging and rewarding AP career,"My role at Walmart as an Asset Protection Manager is driven by reducing shrink.  We focus on all aspects of shrink from shop lifting to internals to process and controls.  What makes the job challenging is working with a team of 300+ associates from cashiers to store management to get the job done.  The reward comes in when you ignite the SPARK and see them grow.  I can say that I do a lot of teaching and training and that is a pivotal part of the job.  The other portion is digging into numbers and seeing what the data says.  Them making SMART action plans to get the team either back in process or to the next level.  At Walmart, every store is unique and each person brings new insights which keep the days new and fresh.

I was hired as a part time front end associate. They were able to work around my classes and didn’t give me too many hours. After about 2 weeks, I was being scheduled 40 hours a week (full time hours), and when I brought it to the supervisors attention, I was promised change that never came.

"Okay, depending on what area you work in","Only working as part time because I am a college student. I think it depends the type of walmart you work at. Not all, but some managers are very biased and lets people do whatever they want. If you were not their favorite, they will make you do most of the work. For example, they will sometimes only let 2 employee be on a cash register while there are 4 other employees just stocking or doing freight. There will be very long lines and they would not help. Some of the management team are very unappreciative. The security team are basically useless too. They are never there when you need them when you catch people stealing. But when you don't need them, they will be fussing at you to do your job correctly. Overall, it is not the best job or worst. Not everyone is a bad manager, but aware of the ones that are.

If it’s right for you and you love working in retail you would fit in,"While being an employee some days some of us wouldn’t have people to relieve us for our breaks or lunches until 2 hours after you were suppose to go yet they sent other people in the same department that started later on their breaks/lunch before you, Especially going home was the worst sometimes you would need to stay back a couple hours to wait for people to show up because they were understaffed. Helping customers that are frustrated was another thing when asking management for help and sometimes we would be waiting 10-15 minutes for one to show up and Having to explain over and over that they are busy helping others and will come shortly, sometimes they wouldn’t come to help them as well. Most times helping other departments was never the issue but a lot of the time they would forget about you and leave you there without saying anything else when your supposed to just be there to relieve someone for lunch or break and they end up not coming back. I know In all cases the customer is always right but sometimes when we would help people out that just aren’t having a good day and end up taking it out on you some of the management feels the need to put you down in front of that customer for whatever reason to prove they were right and you were wrong when it wasn’t even about that. Management could be way better here and I hope they will do so to improve that. ",2,Former Employee,Seasonal Sales Associate ,"Pearl City, HI",4/14/22,2022,4,14
Demanding but very rewarding. ,"Walmart remains one of the largest companies in the world.

Overload on team members ,"You are actually not able to be yourself there. They overload the associates, make them work roles they are not paid for, and run areas without the pay. Once they feel that you can do it they make you run areas without even getting the pay. It was one Walmart or one best way that went out the window and was who ever the boss is way. Unfair treatment with lots of favoritism. It’s basically a company that you have to know who you know to continue up the chain. Once you open door to someone outside the store (market managers) your privacy is invaded and they tell who said what. Then your treated differently. Market mangers wasn’t available at all times then why say anything if it’s going to be a backlash. What happened to the loving company as a kid I longed to work for. At first I thought just this market but it’s everywhere.

Good place to work if you do not mind subjugating yourself to stress & hypocrisy,"Over all Walmart is a fantastic place to work and be. I will forever stand by that, especially because the benefits help so many people all over the world. However, for those who wish to move up or those who have a hard time being understood, you may be in for a ride. Despite the common belief they try to broadcast to everyone, it IS who you know, and not what you know, in terms of moving up. It does not matter how good you are, if you are not liked, you will not move up. Even if every customer loves you, sales are up, ect. Next pain point, management has a tendency to have their own beliefs and culture of sorts. It does not matter if you have a record yourself having a car wreck, if they believe you are skipping out on work intentionally or just don't like you, hello point, two of 5 if it is a weekend or an ""event day"" (personal experience, still have the video and the points!)TLDR; Good place to work.

Very disappointed....I expected better,I took the role based on the culture I thought was true and it turned out to be nothing but a fear mongering micro managing stressful atmosphere. Managers lead by fear which was shocking to see this behavior in the home office...they are phoney. You feel daily that you are just a number on a dashboard and your role will be dissolved at anytime due to the company creating more automation to take over. The work load is extreme and if you are good they keep piling more on you and let you know you should be thankful to have a job. To move up you need to be in with the certain managers that keep getting promoted every few months. I definitely learned a lot and used my experience to get into a better company that actually cares about employees not just feeds phoney lines and pep talks. Walmart is not transparent like they claim and will squeeze you for everything. I did meet some great coworkers for sure sadly they felt the same way. In all of my career this was the worst experience which was so disappointing since I expected better. Most managers here are not qualified to lead a team. My department had 3 in my time there and each was worse than the next creating a black cloud over our team and no one wanted to be on that team...She was even investigated for her behavior but nothing was done. Employees get moved to other teams as well as volunteered to work on other teams and are not notified of what is going on then get lied to.

It’s a buffer job for young people.,"In my opinion, if you are young and don’t have much experience, Wal-Mart is a start. Management wasn’t good, customers are either nice or horrible, but it’s Wal-mart (What do you expect?) Some people enjoy working here or at least tolerate ir since they’ve been there for years and are a familiar with the routine. Overall, get your experience and leave once you feel the time is right.

It's an alright place considering that it is one of the biggest retailers in America. ,Obviously in retail you don't really get to work for what you are hired for and therefore you're going to be at many different places unless you're specifically a cashier.

"If you've ever heard ""It's Walmart"" then you already know","It's Walmart. They barely train you, you don't really learn anything from the computer ""training"" that you are expected to complete by X date, and many of the managers are extremely rude and/or aren't personable. Granted, not every Walmart has these issues and sometimes you get 'lucky' with a great management team. You DO run into a lot of 'clique's' in any position with this company. They tend to hire mostly 'young' people and if you are older you just end up shaking your head a bunch because of it.If you happen to get hurt on the job and bad enough that you shouldn't be working at all, they'll work you anyways and put you on that 'door' position where just about every customer is mad at you for asking to see their receipt. They'll try to get you to do things that are outside your restrictions just to try to get your work comp nullified.If you have a family, you won't have any 'work balance', so don't expect to have that in your life. Hardest part of any of the roles with this company will be lack of training and high expectations from managers that act like you should know what you're doing after a couple days.

Used to be cool,"When I first started, my store was fully staffed, and that changed swiftly. Now the store is woefully understaffed and management at all levels are characteristically incompetent and have zero concern for workers OR customers. Sales Associates are most often berated or written up for incomplete tasks (a workload that is impossible to accomplish) and also browbeaten for serving customer's needs over assigned tasks. Customers cannot find anyone, much less find anyone who can answer simple questions about products and the Fabrics department is characteristically empty, that Associate most often working in another department or having to cover multiple departments or tasks. The Company policy of ""More with less"" means that all Associates are overburdened with tasks and the store is a mess from one end to the other because the workload is spread too thin. I'm good, REALLY good, but even I cannot follow the dictates of incompetent management and be available for the customers. Anyone who says that ""Customers are our #1 concern"" is lying to you.

"It's a good starting job. If you're on time and a good worker, it's almost impossible to get fired. Don't expect the same hours though.","I have fun most days because of my coworkers. One thing you need to master is multi-tasking. If you can multi-task while you work it makes the job way easier. Also, I'd invest in some earphones, it makes the job go by way quicker. It's not a bad starting job, in my current store there isn't much opportunity to move up. They created a new system, they were getting rid of all the management and supervisor positions, and they replaced them with ""team leads and coaches"". However, they hired the exact same people for those positions. Nothing changed other than the title of the people. Not only that, but they seem to favor some people over others. You don't really have an opportunity to move up unless you're good friends with someone that's already at a higher position. Other than that, it can be a good job. It's very relaxed, but don't expect to get the same hours constantly. The department you work in strongly influences the hours you work. In the produce department, it's almost a guaranteed 40hours.

I learned I learned about the department on my own for the most part I was just told was just told the bear basics . I had to go on the wire to learn more about the departments that I worked in with the exception of working in the pharmacy by 4 my last 3 and a 1/2 years at Walmart was time well spent because of the department that I worked in I worked in the pharmacy pharmacy with a great pharmacy manager and pharmacy assistant  Manager. My coworkers were very helpful in teaching me how to work in the pharmacy they were helpful when I was studying for my certification.

Before anyone says ""find a better job,"" you try starting out and working the same positions we have. Anyway.

We get to use an ear bud with music/podcast on the overnight shift.  heck, ive even seen ppl talking on the phone while they work.   its pretty relaxed as long as you can pull your weight.

There are great managers, co-workers, and customers and there are not-so-great managers, co-workers, and customers. As with any job that is to be expected. As a cashier, I personally don't feel like 12 dollars an hour is the appropriate compensation for our work. We do most of the cleaning up after customers, and deal with people who are downright disrespectful and people who could be potentially dangerous all day, every day. The work drama never ends, you can't trust anyone. I have had co-workers say things that are untrue to the managers, and the way certain managers handled the situation was unfair and I felt unheard. The full-time benefits are the best thing about the job in my opinion, and what makes the job worth it. Although, you can't live with 12 dollars an hour and I have had many coworkers struggling to make ends meet to support themselves and their families. I've had many great days, but that was mostly in the beginning. After a while you begin to notice how corporate and corrupt everything is or can be. Associates who have been there long-term have said the working environment used to be fun, upbeat, comfortable, and fair - truly like a walmart family, but not anymore. There are no sick days, if something happens to you at work such as an asthma attack you still get a point (5 points to termination, co-call no-show = 3, call out = 1, late or early = .5) and the point system is the main reason it can be hard to hold a job at walmart.

Unprofessional workplace. ,"I’ve found the company and management to be illogical, hypocritical, and unprofessional. They hardly promote associates before hiring new people to be management.

Chaotic and unorganized ,"I’ve previously worked at a different store which was fine, but once I started at my current location it was never ending turmoil. Items are almost never stocked correctly, and we as pickers suffer for that. Getting paid $13/hr is fine but they expect us to to do way more than what they pay us for.

Making moves,Walmart is positioning itself in a good spot for them as a company. They will pay 100% of your tuition so if you can't afford to go to college working at Walmart is a great option.

Relationships on a personal level are fun but get used to being overworked and underpaid,"A typical day at work for first shift typically involves quickly fulfilling part of my job specific tasks before being stripped away to complete the leftover tasks from the overnight shift, who get paid $2 - $3.50 more an hour than you. Something valuable I learned from this job is how to live with the ever increasing pressure of depression and feeling of worthlessness from clearing the backroom of freight only to come in the next morning and it's full of freight from the previous shift not completing it and knowing that you don't get paid to work it but your gonna be threatened into doing it at risk of your job.

Productive work place and definitely fun to work with the associates I work with. ,"I have worked for Walmart now for 2 years, and I have to say it’s had it’s good days and bad days, but it’s not about that it’s about the people you come in contact with and making just one person smile a day, you know you’ve accomplished something or if you’ve helped one person straighten out there problem you’ve accomplished something and the benefits are better than any company I’ve worked for. The associates I work for are some of the best it’s not easy dealing with so many different personalities.  So instead of it being Walmart Associates, it’s more like one great big family that sees each other sometimes more than we see our families.. Management is always around to lend a helping hand and I’ve never been so more blessed than I am today to work with each and everyone of my coworkers.. These last few yrs Covid has taking a toll on the whole world and it brought out the hate in this world but at Walmart we held our heads high and gave the best customer service we could ever give and the stress of being in public with all that Walmart showed their appreciation in more than one way and that may friends is why I Love working for Walmart.

Terrible management and always under staffed ,"First off let me say that most of the managers are outright horrible. They had favorites who got away with everything and then people who they liked to pick on ie. Giving some people 10 different job areas while talking about World of War craft with the favorites. I even had a manager try to discourage me about future plans I had. The second thing is coverage. Or rather lack thereof. It was commonplace for any employee, from any department, to be taken to another department they have no knowledge of to work for that day. Because they didn't schedule the right way. And they never actually teach you these new areas. It's more of a sink or swim situation. Most companies pay extra when you learn more than one job but not Walmart. While working in the pick up area, we were expected to cover electronics and photo lab in addition to sporting goods and hardware if the person over those departments was on break or absent (which they almost always were. Most times they wouldn't even tell anyone they were going on break). The last thing I loathed was the managers, and some of the department managers or leads, inability to leave their personal lives at home. They would come in all moody and would not only expect everyone to bow to them but would also snap at others because they can't regulate between work and home. There were also employees that got away with murder simply because managers didn't discipline them. They essentially shrug their shoulders and say ""Let's all try to get along.""

Employee experience depends upon coworkers and management ,"Although i was let go from my job, i would consider going back. On my usual 6am to 3pm shift i had amazing coworkers, however it seems that if you work at 2pm to 11pm shift you work with many high schoolers who (despite me only being 18/19 when working there, but graduated from high school) can get away with doing the bare minimum.

Lack of instruction and direction,"There was no one to show me exactly what needed to be done at my orientation the second day, the first day I got handed a Walmart employee book, talked to a district trainer, went over the book, walked around the store, then sent out to the department I was going to. The “team leader” didn’t say much, just pointed at boxes on a pallet and said “put them there” and pointed to another pallet! I’ve worked Walmart before, I’ve worked in retail for over 45 years, this is the worst place for anyone starting out in retail or their first job! New employees need to be scheduled with existing employees for at least their first 2 weeks to be shown exactly what they will be doing (daily tasks). Shown how to use scanners, the mobile phone they give employees to use while on the clock, how to look up their schedules on the phone, how to look up any assigned tasks to them to be completed that day, where to find all the supplies needed, and the overstock, and exactly WHO is in charge if you have any questions! Basically, because I worked there before (I only cashiered) they shoved me out on the floor without any direction! Horrible training, the people in my department are extremely unhappy people, no smiles, no comradery, nothing but hurry, hurry, hurry and complaints!

Awful store ,"Worked on cap 2 where we would unload trucks and stock the grocery side of the store. Absolutely worst work place I’ve ever been. Managers constantly belittle you, no matter what position in the store they have.

Fast Paced Environment and Actually Fun.  If you can't sit at desk all day long and like a physical come to CAP 2 at Walmart.,"I am an unloader so my day involves unloading trucks, stocking freight and staging freight for overnight shift to work.  This is a great job if you like staying busy.  Unloading and pulling freight will make the day go by faster.  Days where we have two general merchandise trucks to unload can be long and rough but the better you stack your pallets the better a double truck day goes.  Full time hours are there with decent benefits if you want them.  Overtime hours are there especially during the holiday season.  If you are a college student Walmart will work around your college schedule.  This is also a great place for a high school student to start.  This is a team environment and the great thing about CAP 2 is that slackers don't last which is wonderful for those of us that show up to WORK.  In my department how you work and the effort you put into your job determines how much respect you have.  That's a good thing as respect is something that should be earned.  Hopefully Home Office will eventually come to realize that compensation needs to be tied to work ethic and merit.  As it is now experience, education, and effectiveness are not rewarded by compensation.

I’m not sure how much it differs depending on location but at mine we weren’t required to help customers because we still had to be pretty fast. “Time off task” is a pain and management would get upset if we hadn’t scanned anything in two minutes. It was near mindless work but everyone is unhappy/stressed, customers are not the best to work with (especially since most of us had headphones in, so people would literally grab us, wave their hand in front of our faces, or get in our personal space to get our attention.)

I enjoyed that part though because it made time fly.  I've made some close friends with some of my co-workers, leads and coaches over the last 2 years.  The problem is, over the last 2 years, I've found no matter how hard you work, how great things look when you go to punch out, that  drop of feel-good satisfaction will be stomped on as soon as upper-management comes in and unloads a barrage of nothing but criticism.  Even when it is PROVEN no one on overnights was responsible for what ever the issue(s) is/are.  Sadly, tomorrow will be more of the same same.

Do it for the free school,"There's a free college tuition program. Work here to get that, get your degree, then leave. No strings attached, you won't owe the company any tuition if you leave. They pay for everything. Degrees are mostly business related, there are IT and healthcare certificates too (as well as GED stuff if you need it). Trade schools as well. The schools are accredited, UF is available. Typical retail environment. Everyone's miserable here. Everyone thinks they're doing the most work out of anyone else, so everyone's bitter. No one knows anything. Communication is poor. Super easy job but you'll quickly become a negative nancy just like everyone else. They eliminate jobs every few years and end up moving everyone around. This company changes things and starts/ends new programs so often that it's become a joke. Extreme favoritism. I benefitted from it but it's still unfair. They overwork their team leads and supervisors, salaried members of management look like they need a drink. I don't completely blame management, as they have higher ups barking orders at them and they realize some of the requests are stupid too. However, the entire experience will just chip away at you. Whether you're applying here as salaried or hourly, don't make this place a career. Try to get out after a couple years, although it's easy to become complacent here. Like I said, it's a pretty easy job as a regular associate. Keep your head down, do your job, go home. Rinse and repeat. But seriously, get your degree here and then peace out.

Decent pay boring work,Decent pay boring work and not enough lifts for everyone who is certified. Management is friendly but clueless. Some workers will run to get a lift then just stand on or by it while other hard workers are busting their tails with pallet jacks. They also give the hardest workers the worst tasks. The PTO has to be earned and you only gain around 15 minutes of it a day so building up a decent amount of time is nearly impossible. Also work is very seasonal. You may push a broom and clean for hours and hours or you can leave and not get paid. I wasted all my pto leaving early because I didn’t want to play janitor. Also you’ll walk anywhere from 5-12  miles a day if you are a good worker and some of the boxes are very heavy. It’s a great workout though. PS the Walmart employee discount sucks. ,3,Current Employee,Unloader ,"Laurens, SC",4/4/22,2022,4,4
Terrible Management.,"Terrible management, but for the most part the coworkers are pretty cool people. Management throws stuff that usually takes multiple people to do on one person then gets mad when it doesn’t get finished. Overtime is very often as well, usually leave around 12…. Sometimes 1AM. Management won’t fire the workers that just walk around and talk, even after it being addressed to them. Already lost 7 people within not even a whole 2 months. The building needs to be bigger or there needs to be less freight because the backroom is full of pallets to the point where you would have to climb on pallets or squeeze between them.",2,Former Employee,Stocking Team 2 ,"Crestview, FL",4/4/22,2022,4,4
"Unless you are desperate, don't apply.","Managers are horrible here, blatant disrepect and push employees way too hard. No A/C unless you are in a managers office so you sweat for 10-12 hours. Two 20 minute breaks, that end up being only 10 because walking to the break room and washing up is a part of your break. Expectations are ridiculous and always rising. Good employees get overlooked while the employees that make friends with managers get so much favoritism and special treatment. Mandatory overtime with sometimes less than 24 hours notice. Equipment barely works and you will be held accountable for things that are out of your control. Only upside is better pay that most places around here and cool coworkers. Most employees are burnt out way before the end of the week and HR will not lift a finger to change things when you have concerns. High turnover rate because people quit or get fird so much. Never again will I even consider this place only stayed because I needed the job and left the second I could.",1,Former Employee,Shipping Loader ,"Alachua, FL",4/4/22,2022,4,4

Job could’ve been amazing if it wasn’t for the manager ,"I got hired for bakery but at orientation was told to switch to fresh associate, but was still getting paid the bakery pay. Most of the time I would spend my first 15 minutes walking around the entire grocery side looking for literally any manager to ask what job duties to do that day. Was told they’d work with my school schedule, told them my availability at the interview then turned in my schedule on orientation day. Manager would purposefully schedule me DURING my class times on the specific days I had class. Let it slide the first and second time but ended up having to use all my points calling in for school even after reminding her every time I saw the schedule. She just didn’t care. I ended up getting let go because of my points at the end of the temporary employment. Other than all that and favoritism it was an ok job.

"Terrible management, low morale.","Walmart has all the potential to be a great workplace. Unfortunately, this is heavily over shadowed by the terrible management styles and structures. The levels of unfairness are increasingly toxic and serve to only lower employee morale on a day to day basis. Management berates, embellishes and threaten employees regularly. They will not work with schedules, even though they claim to. Calls and emails to Walmarts employee ethics hotline prove to be completely useless and subsequently force employees to resign. The pay is decent but not worth how much stress will be forced onto you. ",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Brownsville, TX",4/3/22,2022,4,3
Difficult for no reason. From a driver standpoint.,I thought it was great until i did the math. Money is fair. Being able to park at DC or store is good. But slip-seating sucks. Some of the trainers suck. Through on-boarding and orientation you would think the trainers would line up to all the information and safety you learned and they dont! The people in the office are great. After on-boarding and orientation you have to wait until jobs cleared you before you can drive. Meaning you cant drive until your past jobs call back of fax required info back! You will have to ride with trainer the whole time until etc. And you dont get $.89 a mile…you average about that after everything you get paid. But you will make about $.57 a mile plus paid activities. Again it sucks to keep slip-seating and sharing truck beds! Good vacation but it should be considering your gone over the road!🤷🏿‍♂️ If they gave drivers their own truck instead of having them share trucks and beds and having them empty all their things out every week and bring all your things back into the truck every week. walmart would be the best otr job out there. It doesnt add up to me! Oh yeah getting paid every 2 weeks suck too!!! ,2,Current Employee,Professional Truck Driver ,"Opelika, AL",4/3/22,2022,4,3

Overall I learned alot working for walmart for almost 10 Years before I decided to move on to another job venture,Overall Walmart is a great company its all about what managers you have and how they treat the employees and the customers because without good management and communication skills you have alot of chiefs barking orders at you every single one of them would tell you to do something different but you were already assigned to get a task done from a different manager Im not sure how it is now since I haven't worked for the company for a few years now but I started out in Walmart retail in 2009-  on the remodel crew after about 4 months got hired on in maintenance did that for about a year before getting promoted to cashier in electronics started learning more about electronics then I ever did then they taught me about how to sell phones for Att us cellular verizon became a wireless associate for about 5-6 years  then I decided to move up in the company after I passed the supervisor / asm position I quit after being A Supervisor for 3 years now I’m doing what Ive always loved selling phones and electronics for Verizon ,4,Former Employee,SUPPORT MANAGER ,"Yreka, CA",4/3/22,2022,4,3

Other employers pay more for less work and less stress. Market 440 has the absolute worst market manager.

Good starter job,"Good starter job if you still live at home. They expect you to clear a 8 foot ballet in 15 minutes. If you work fast do it only to move up into another position. Otherwise those 12 ballets you did in 6 hours before you’re supposed to “Zone” after your break @5am goes unnoticed. The only thing they see is, that you did a lot and will ask you to do more. Team Leads make or break it. They don’t pay well for stockers considering how much you have to lift especially in a supermarket. Overnight stockers should get $17 and day stickers in Orem should get $15. They are wanting to do away with Grocery Pickers. Don’t believe me check out the area by automotive in American fork super center where you can’t enter.Same with cashiers, they are making self check out more available and bigger. So if your wanting a cashier or grocery picker job I’d think twice about it. Overall, like I said good starter if you live at home or if you rent a room, don’t have a car payment, don’t pay for your phone bill and don’t have any debt (school/car) then you can save pretty good. But if you want to get ahead in life, have no car payment, pay for your own things, buy a house, or rent your own place for $1200k+ a month, travel for once, have normal work / Life balance or even better to not work until your 60-70 years old than get something else.

We get cut on overtime constantly so they can have their bonuses. The newer associates get paid more than people who have been with the company for years and years.

Some are chill and let you do your work, while others will breathe down your throat and stop you every 10 minutes to make sure you're making the quota.The work load is honestly too much to fully stock most nights, and as soon as you learn where everything is located and you start to think you'll be moving faster, they rearrange everything and you have to repeat the cycle.They'll hire you on as part-time then schedule you the 39 1/2 hours that will keep you from all of the full-time benefits they initially sold to you.While the hour lunch breaks and 15 minute rests are nice, they're non-negotiable and higher management will stress the accuracy of your time sheet so you're left with having to clock in and out at specific times multiple times in a shift.Pay is abysmal and not nearly enough to make a living.The upsides are the coworkers who understand your plight and are able to make most shifts tolerable.

Besides Dollar Tree, I think Walmart is the one of the lower paying retailers in my area. The turnover rate at my store is atrocious because they don't want to pay us fairly for the work we have to do (a lot of which is not in our job description because we are so understaffed, a direct result of people leaving for better pay).Management is pretty terrible overall, and most everyone thinks it. Front End for my store has one or two really great leads but that's it. Most days I'll come in and learn we have no leads at all because they've called out, which forces associates to step in and manage. Where are the coaches who actually have this in their job description? Who knows! In the span of a pay period, I see my store manager maybe once or twice (and it's usually when they're sitting on their behind in the office or clocking out). They only really appear to work whenever their boss comes in to inspect the store, and suddenly they're everywhere all at once.You have to set your schedule with specific availability because they *will* stray outside of it; coworkers complain to me all the time about being scheduled during times they've stated they're unavailable, and some managers either forget or just won't make the changes for you. Requesting off is only easy if you know your plans three weeks in advance, otherwise good luck getting out of a shift.The attendancy policy is trash. You can't exceed five points (either from calling out - more...",2,Current Employee,Front End Associate ,"Huntsville, AL",4/2/22,2022,4,2
I enjoyed my actual job and most of the customers,The work is enjoyable and the customers are usually pleasant. Most of the management team are not helpful and somewhat unapproachable.

Not a good work environment ,Walmart  cares nothing about you as a person. Managers walk around always belittling everyone on staff. I NEVER heard them tell anyone one they were or had done a good job. Very depressing work environment!!!,1,Current Employee,Associate ,"Morganton, NC",4/2/22,2022,4,2
Good for a first time job,Good to get your foot in the door of working for a teen. Some stores are better then others. They won’t let you move up if you want too.

Great in the beginning ,Lack of communication and support from managment. Hard work goes unnoticed while slacking off and favoritism helps you. Pay should go off skill and performance.,3,Former Employee,"Online Shopper, Department Manager ","Southaven, MS",4/2/22,2022,4,2
Not the best," Work started out awesome! But slowly more things were added on to my day to the point I was basically a team lead with bare bones pay. I do have to admit, there is so much room for advancement it's insane. The reason I didn't officially become a team lead is because the management was horrible. They treated team leads like absolute dirt. You'd find them crying in the bathroom, passing out in the store. They'd be getting cussed out before your eyes over nothing. Multiple complaints were made but any complaints went back to management so it would be game over. A very retaliation work place. People under management were pretty cool. Everyone had my back besides my personal team lead. ",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Louisville, KY",4/2/22,2022,4,2
Only good thing about it is the pay is slightly above minimum wage,"You're given a task that requires more people than they'll ever actually hire. You constantly have to pick up after the shift before you, as they don't have enough people to finish their work either, which only makes it less likely you'll finish your job.There's a reason people don't stick around long.",1,Current Employee,Meat/Produce Associate ,"Putnam, CT",4/2/22,2022,4,2

Good place to work while in school,Very flexible with schedule when part time. Lots of constant change throughout company so what is ok today will not be tomorrow. When getting hired on you will sign agreement that you will do roles and duties outside of your job. This will be used to force you to learn many areas. Lots of areas in store are understaffed so you will be working many areas at once to make up for lack of help. Lack of management in store will also leave you to feeling unsupported with customers and their needs. ,4,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Clinton, MO",4/1/22,2022,4,1

Kind of a stressful place to work when lazy people who aren't drug tested get hired,Overall if you want too be treated like a garbage can that likes being pushed around for a good pay and little respect. Then this is the company for you. Almost all of management are bad at their job and let their stress of being terrible out on their workes. They promise things that they cant actually give or reward you with. Honestly its just a place to get a year and a half of retial experience. Cause any other job has a better work environmen.

Great Environment horrible management,"I was 1of 3 employees who worked & started in the new online grocery department on October 2020. It went through a testing phase for a year. If successful,the department will become official. Today, it is! We learned from scratch through trial and error. Finally, established a system sooner. Eventually I was the only one left. I trained managers and future employees. I worked with the district manager. I reported the good, bad and the ugly. The managers will boost your head up into thinking they're going to make you a manager, and say thing as, ""You're in charge"". Without the pay. It was rarely a good job, but a lot of bad jobs. When the department officially started, They didn't even bother to interview myself and another coworker. Which we were getting praised by everyone and corporate. Instead they gave it to a manager i trained to manage me. Fun fact? The manager would leave us two in charge and ask us question that they didn't know. it was a slap in the face..Oh, and this was after my promotion from departments. i was a stocker before, and that's a different ballgame...Don't get me wrong. It's a great beginner's job. My advice is, clock in, do your work, take a break, come back on time, clock out. The more you know, the deeper you get. It's a dog eat dog world any position above a regular associate. So don't get caught in any drama. I quit do to integrity of the managerial branch. Would I come back, YES! I love working at Walmart.Great Co-workers! Great Pay! 32+ hours! 1 hour lunch!Cons: Management.

not good,"Among the responsibilities of the job are shopping for customer groceries, organizing completed orders in the backroom, and loading customers' cars.

An overall good place to work ,"For the most it is a nice supportive, family type of environment. Some of the management sucks especially when you’re a cashier. When you’re a cashier management likes to breath down your neck and is a mostly strict environment. Cashiers work really hard, but don’t get paid the amount we deserve. Benefits are great though and coworkers are great. ",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Anna, TX",4/1/22,2022,4,1
"Decent pay, good coworkers, but is a perpetual sinking ship.","The decent compensation and good coworkers are the usual but understaffing will lead to you being pulled in multiple directions to fill the gaps. Often work in your own department will build up for potentially months while others are begging for your help to cover. Growth in the store is good as your first raise/promotion doesn’t take long to get if you’re clearly putting in some effort. However frequent overtime will also eventually start to wear you down, which is what drives most away in the first place. Luckily Walmart isn’t near the worst offender so if that isn’t a deal breaker for you, then most positions should be good.

Honestly the check is nice. That's all,I've gotten in trouble for having questions. I've been in trouble for doing something a way one manager told me and then yelled at for not doing it right. Putting in ppto is almost impossible because all they do is reject it. Then when I asked what to do he told me to come clock in or call in and then put it in. Then got an occurrence for putting in the hours for moving weeks in advance after rejecting it.,1,Current Employee,Freight Handler ,"Lubbock, TX",4/1/22,2022,4,1

The other workers there are good to work with but management isn’t that good,I love the people that I work alongside with but one of my team leads has forgotten breaks before (a lot of times) which those are needed when you are standing up long periods of time. I am a cashier and I got injured to where I was put on crutches and my store manager said he “couldn’t Do anything to help because the injury was not on the job” even though they could really easily put me on a chair and let me work (which I had a doctors note for).

I enjoyed doing things like price changes and working in the freezer on occasion. The hardest part of the job was top stocking. If you have bad legs, this task is not for you. The one thing that stood out to me, and what majorly contributed to me wanting to quit was the fact that they were very stubborn when it came to reducing my hours when I asked for it. I filled out not one, but 3 schedule changes in my time at Walmart, each time asking for hours between 15-25 per week. Instead of that, they gave me upwards of 36. I have school! I have my own life! I can't go to school and work a borderline full time job all while trying to have a personal life. I most certainly wouldn't recommend anyone this job for any reason other than the starting wage, which compared to other entry level positions, isn't actually all that substantial.",3,Former Employee,Food Sales Associate ,"Waco, TX",3/31/22,2022,3,31
Something always to learn ,Lot of potential for growth and they are world wide. I recommend  them because the offer a range of positions depending on what store you are at .

Fair life work balance,I started with Walmart and my son was diagnosed w cancer. They were excellent at the time off I needed even as a new employee. They gave me a personal intermittent leave of absence to care for the needs of my son even though I'd not completed the required hours yet bc I was new.   ,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Denver, NC",3/31/22,2022,3,31
It's okay ,"If you're lucky enough to get along with your team lead, you'll be just fine. Customers aren't the best (but are they ever?). Time off and protected are decent. The benefits are better than any I've had in the past",4,Current Employee,Auto Care Technician ,"Plainfield, IL",3/31/22,2022,3,31
Never a dull moment ,"Walmart’s philosophy has become one that is prevalent among big box stores - do more with less. Very few managers care for their associates. Most managers are stressed out and only focus on their own careers and how to make it through each shift. Goals are unrealistic as far as timelines are concerned. I wouldn’t say no concern for employees is shown. Lots of faux concern, however, is what employees receive. Many clicks exist within stores. Lots of gossip throughout the whole store - regardless of position. ",2,Former Employee,Operations Manager ,Kentucky,3/31/22,2022,3,31

They will exploit you if you let them,"Walmart is a place that exploits its workers if you let any supervisor have that power. Supervisors and managers will see a fast efficient worker and ask more of that person, instead of asking the slow inefficient associates to do a better job. If you get a job at walmart just dont get enough points (being late or absent) to get fired and your job is probably safe, but dont try to be the best at walmart because they will exploit you.

Not too shabby,"Working at Walmart as a stock associate wasn’t all that bad. The job description changed in a year when I worked. I was stocking shelves for multiple aisles for about eight months and earned thirteen an hour. After that, I no longer stocked shelves anymore and made sixteen an hour. Stocking was now the night shift's responsibility. Now morning shift through day shift only sorted the shelves to make them look appealing to the customer (which made earning sixteen dollars an hour while barely working great!).

Since I consistently delivered excellent results, my leads and coaches requested that I assist them with their work, which was pretty fun. The work itself is  not difficult, but my store's managers often have high unrealistic expectations, which may be stressful.

Some of customers are pretty nice and understanding and those are the ones that make me like my job. The only con I would say is that they only train you for like 1 day and you’re on your own after that. I was by myself on my first day. Yes you can ask questions but some of the managers act like they don’t want to help you. It can get slow sometimes. Everyone at the front desk, including team leads/managers will stand there, and stare at you for some reason which is annoying. Other than that it’s a pretty nice environment.

"Perfect opportunity for me. Walmart Supercenter in Cedar Falls, Iowa 50614","I was ready for a exciting and rewarding change of pace. My new job has been exceptionally fulfilling and much more than just a job. It's like being a part of society again. The benefits of having patience and support to succeed in my life one day at a time is true serenity. I was stuck without a car or finances to obtain one as the winter weather was a true test of indurance Shuffling around on the bus to and from work. Snow, wind, rain and a few days of nice weather waiting outside on the corner of my neighborhood for a City bus and then the other 2 busses I must transfer to. Testing me daily with a 2 hour ride to work and then home from work another 2 hour tour! Mind you the busses run early and late from the set assumed time of arrival. Worst part was experiencing the inflation of cars and even gas, groceries,. natural gas for heating and cooking; basically everything changed these past 6 months. I felt lost and confused about my lack of prosperity. Until lately, I have been hired at Walmart in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The blessings of waiting and choosing the best company to grow with and flourish, blossoming once again into a independent and confIdent lady.

Toxic work environment and quality of life,"The more you go above and beyond, the more you are perceived as a threat. Is a cult like culture, and favoritism is rampant.

One of the worst places I’ve worked,"The pay is decent. The hours varied but if you didn’t already have 40 hours, you could usually get more shifts. Usually I would have 3 or 4 days scheduled and would have to add in the extra one or two days manually if there was availability. No real sense of job roles. I was a personal shopper but got thrown into other areas with minimal training. Which led to me feeling like I couldn’t be the best at my job because half the time I was just winging it. Figuring it out on my own as I went along. Asking coworkers didn’t really help as half the time they didn’t know either. Finding anyone in management was hard as communication around the store was definitely lacking. The Reidsville store was very, very messy and disorganized. I couldn’t find the items I needed for my orders 50% of the time. Customers will constantly interrupt you to ask where something is or to do a price check. It’s not their fault. Most items weren’t in stock or weren’t in the correct location. Overall, this job gave me severe anxiety. If you don’t really care about your job and being satisfied by the end of a shift, go for it. $13 an hour for digital personal shopper role.

Quite often times I was the only cashier Wednesday nights and it was scary when a line would form quickly at ten pm.  When we had more help, I would be outside bringing in shopping carts until I was needed inside on a cash register.  I began to develop heel pain from working on concrete pavement.

Basically don’t work at Walmart.,"Maybe other Walmarts aren’t as bad but the walmart I worked for was not fun. For one it took me over a year to even get a steady schedule. They never give people a set schedule they change it every two weeks and it’s never the same. Second of all management is super lazy. All they do is walk around and tell people what to do very rarely do they actually help or do anything. The only time they do anything is during inventory. Next they don’t pay people enough to work there. If you’re good at what you do there’s a 98% chance you won’t even be doing what you got hired to do. You will be doing 5 peoples jobs all to yourself and get paid your minimum salary. For me I literally had to be a supervisor everyday almost for 2 years and I didn’t get paid to be one. they definitely take advantage of you. On top of that they don’t care about there employees. After two years of working there they fired me for something that I didn’t even know could happen. At Walmart you make this thing called ppto and that’s you’re protected paid time off. You can use it anytime you want for anything. If you need to go home early for an emergency, if you’re late to work, Ect. You use your ppto to cover it and they say you can use it whenever no questions asked. I used it a few times because I was a few minutes late a couple times because of car trouble and they fired me for it. How is that even fair? They tell you to use your protected paid time off for those specific things and when you do use it you’re not allowed to? Doesn’t make sense to me.

You can make it work if your willing to deal with the circumstances ,"Walmart as a company itself is a great opportunity  for benefits and pay but know that your health or a loved ones health is more important. The management is the problem.

The work itself is not the problem and your attendance is your responsibility. The work is actually pretty much easy but the work conditions also is a problem but, the only solution to that is do your job finish it and go home on time DO NOT do anything extra past your time they will expect you to do so try to force you to do so or, hold more work then your completed tasks against you despite being ungrateful that you did it all or most of it. The way management comes at you very inappropriate or the way they do things would be the only problem you have to face if you actually care about seriously working there or trying to move up as I stated before favoritism is a very strong function and if you don’t fit in your just a worker and that’s okay make your money and GO HOME. overall working there you have your good days and - more...",3,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Alexandria, LA",3/28/22,2022,3,28

Online Grocery Department ,"I worked with Walmart OGP for nearly 6 months. When I first started working the management was okay, and the team leads were nice and kept me willing to work. After a couple months the department had completely fallen. Management has quit, leads have been fired, and nearly every worker I started my employment with was gone. My last few weeks at Walmart I noticed a lot more than I did my entire employment. The management loves to bring down their employees to other workers and they only care for their success, not your own. My last complaint about Walmart is the night crew / lunch schedules. In the 6 months of employment with this company the most stressful part of my days were the closing shift, and the lunch. Often times many workers weren’t able to take their break or lunch due to not having enough workers to take out orders due to the fact only 3-4 people were working the last 50+ orders which doesn’t seem like a lot but when 26 cars come at once and a 5 minute wait limit, it is. The only good things I have to say about my time in this department is that every employee I worked with was incredibly nice, it became sort of a work family, although you do feel incredibly excluded in certain situations and the pay was amazing. The only reason I would consider going back is for the pay. ",2,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Chicopee, MA",3/27/22,2022,3,27

If your car has ANY ODOR  the store Associates can refuse your service, then ban or have you deactivated. It's VERY risky to work with them.

Toxicity increases the higher you rise,"TLDR: Company gives unprofessionally short heads up on moves and changes, has management at higher levels that grow more likely to be toxic individuals that cause problems that they fire other people for, and refuse to take short term losses for long term gains unless literally unable to do otherwise.I worked for Walmart for 7.5 years before I parted ways with them. I started as a cashier, worked as a buggy boy, CAP 2 associate, and electronics associate before becoming a department manager then support manager.Right before covid I finally got my promotion to Assistant Store Manager. I was forced to move to a new store, usual retail shtick, but I was moved into an alright store. Covid happened and Corporates responses to everything were 2 weeks behind everyone but we got there. Then in October of 2020, after saying they wouldn't, corporate went through with a total structural overhaul that left me in limbo for months. I was shipped on literally three days notice to a new store 2 hours away in a very busy stretch of tourist dense interstate. Because that store was 49 MI away on a straight line from my front door, I could not receive relocation assistance. I powered through until I was informed (again on short notice) I was getting ""promoted"" (moved into same position but new name) marginally closer in a store that, unknown to me, was about to be under a lot of scrutiny.

Draining,I bust my butt all day everyday in the online shopping department. Constantly bending and picking up 50lb+ worth of orders nonstop really takes a toll on your back.

"Difficult tasks, friendly coworkers ","I worked in the deli which I was told was one of the easier jobs. When you get into work, you’re cooking and preparing food to put out in the store, you write the time on the food then bring it out to the hot case, and remove any food that has been there for 4 hours (I believe it was). Good luck though if you’re small and weak, especially if you work the night shift. You’ll be alone most of the time. You can ask managers for help, but if you’re not strong enough to do a task which you must do every day, you’ll have to be asking them for help every day and pulling them away from their job, which is annoying for the both of you. From carrying huge boxes and pulling out the chicken from the oven (which wasn’t that hard for me, but some have gotten burnt), there’s lots of lifting going on. By the time night rolls around you’ll mostly be just cleaning up and removing what’s left in the hot case and then shutting it off, which in my store the hot case controls were on the very bottom of it, so I had to get on the floor, and hurt my finger removing the cover of the controls. Also it can be difficult to put in/remove items from the hot case without getting burnt a little (not like leaving a mark other than maybe a little redness though). The dish washing is so near-impossible, there’s so much to wash and each dish has tons of tiny little crevices that you must deep clean by hand, and if you leave even the smallest bit of residue you’ll be called out on it. The dish water can be extremely hot, I had to reach in very fast to grab the dishes without getting hurt.

Your experience will depend on the type of person you are,"I have mixed feeling about this job. There’s 3 main aspects of the job: picking, dispensing, and sorting. Picking and sorting are easy most of the time, you’ll definitely feel like you’re being paid fairly if that’s mostly what you do. Dispensing is easy too but I think it’s the worst one because it involves the most physical work and customer interaction. If pickers are backed up on orders, you’re going to have a bad day as a dispenser, and in the summer it’s just too hot. The busy days can get bad, and the slow days can get boring. Especially if it’s so slow they start sending you to another department to do their work for them. It’s not hard work but it’s annoying because it’s not the job you signed up for. If you go with other people you like it’s not so bad but sometimes they’ll send you by yourself.There’s blatant favoritism. Some people are allowed to do basically anything they want. If they don’t feel like doing one part of the job then they don’t have to while others will be forced to. You’re supposed to be punished for being late and absent multiple times but people that are friends with a manager can get their points erased and they’ll still be around a long time after they should’ve been fired. You’ll meet a lot of cool people but the environment is like high school for adults with all the drama that can happen. Overall a decent job especially if you’re just starting to work.

It’s not entirely their fault. Expect to be pulled up to cashier when they inevitably staff poorly and have to cover. The biggest thing is, it’s almost impossible to get fired unless you steal or stop showing up.

"Unrelible, depressing ",Definitely an underpaid job for the amount of exertion your body goes through. Mentally depressing for the fact you feel like your job has no real purpose. Overall the company doesn't show to care about you. The work culture and management is some of the worst I've ever seen. The job became unrelible due to the corrupt and poor management. The mental stress from such toxic work environment is not something I can forget easily. It's a good job temporarily but nothing to rely on or settle for.,1,Former Employee,Walmart Online Grocery Pickup ,"Colorado Springs, CO",3/24/22,2022,3,24

It’s A Job,"Worked there for years in the past, and I hen I was rehired currently, I see the place has gone downhill. No holiday pay anymore. No merit raises anymore. The team leads are incompetent and the coaches don’t even bother to learn your name. The so called people lead are never around to actually help the people.

"It's minimum wage, what did you expect","So many call outs,lack of personnel meant horrible scheduling,late or forgotten lunches and breaks, and if you hit your five  you get in trouble when it's their fault for not remembering ",3,Former Employee,Front End Associate ,"Ephrata, WA",3/24/22,2022,3,24
Don’t expect to be able to buy a house,"Everything’s tolerable except the wage. I’m fortunate to have good coworkers but $16 barely covers gas, yet that’s the minimum for my role/job (stocker). And team leads/superiors get paid only $5-$7 more than us “grunts”. Good for those getting into or getting BACK into the job field or those without many financial burdens/responsibilities. Though, it’s highly frustrating that Walmart higher ups see “profit increases” but not those who actually make the business function :/// stocks went up apparently but not enough for me to get paid at least $20? oh and thanks for the 40 cent pay increases...really helps with rent n bills, ya know?",3,Current Employee,Stock Associate ,"Ruckersville, VA",3/24/22,2022,3,24

A culture that continues to degrade,"It’s alarming and disappointing how fast the quality of senior field leadership has deteriorated in in the past few years.

The paycheck never bounced.,"The scheduling was bipolar with schizoid features--you could work open, mid-shift and close all in the same pay period.  That is, until I got reassigned to unloading trucks from 3:00 pm til midnight.  Customers were verbally and sometimes physically abusive.  If you ask for a day off, there will be retaliation in the form of a 10-day work week before and after the days off.  ",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",3/23/22,2022,3,23
Bad management ,"i enjoyed the job and the employees were so nice and felt like family but the bad part about the job was the management, the managers wrongfully terminated over a work injury and didnt wanna pay any compensation and didnt want to pay for therapy ",1,Former Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Ontario, CA",3/23/22,2022,3,23

Confusing & Difficult Place to Work,"Useless & Ineffective Management Team, Serious Lack of Training, Difficult & Confusing Company Policies, No Access to an HR Representative, No clear direction or feedback on job performance.  Management threatens, intimidates, and retaliates employees who don't please them.  One person controls the entire store, other managers are terrifies of this person and refuse to protect their employees from this vindictive person.  The company is fantastic, great benefits, employees treated well, if this one person weren't  at that particular location, it would be an amazing place to work.

Unappreciative Management ,"I have worked for Walmart for nearly 8 years now and while it has never been the greatest job it wasn’t the worst, but now they have cut out all benefits that made working there even worth it. On top of all that upper management never appreciate what work you do get done they only focus on what you didn’t manage to finish despite them giving you a list equal to 30 hours of work to do in an 8 hour shift. ",2,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Defuniak Springs, FL",3/23/22,2022,3,23
Terrible company for managers. ,"I had worked for Walmart for 10+ years prior to leaving. Something I found out was the grass is greener on the other side. As a long time salaried manager I have never been expected so many times in my life to manage by fear, treat associates with disdain hold their job over there heads. This company shows absolutely no compassion for people, it’s like a puppy mill just bring more in to move more out. They take no time to develop its personal. I would never recommend anyone to this company. ",1,Former Employee,Head Coach ,"Portland, OR",3/23/22,2022,3,23

Fun,Fun place to work at with a lot of kind people who support me. Some managers are great while others are rude for rude sake. A lot of favoritism in the location at times.,4,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Boca Raton, FL",3/23/22,2022,3,23
About what you'd expect except for the micromanaging ,The Online Grocery Delivery Dept got a decent raise up to $16hr which made it bearable to deal with some of the management who were overworked so they picked a previous employee who left for another job then came back as a supervisor despite nearly the entire department's reservation and protests. This person is a micromanaging asshat who does not listen to or care about team input and hovers over busy employees when they should be elsewhere working the many fires needing to be put out.  It's been over a year since I moved on to a better job but I stop in to see how my friends are and they are all unhappy because this same supervisor is working later and making them all miserable - true management would step in and save the morale of the dept and fire this complete jerk but the lack of quality candidates and an overstressed dept head make that seem unlikely which is a shame because this could have actually been a fun job.   ,3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Gardnerville, NV",3/23/22,2022,3,23
Not a bad job ,It’s not really a bad job but it has very poor upper management. They really don’t like working with people who have work restrictions. I had a lifting restriction just for 2 weeks due to having stents put in my kidneys so they made me file for a medical leave and take the 2 weeks off work. They then waited for almost 2 months to make the decision to deny my medical leave and fire me for missing work. ,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Coshocton, OH",3/23/22,2022,3,23

 stock ,"It truly depends on what department you are assigned to. If you are on the grocery side of the store, it's hard work. But all your stock comes pre packaged on a pallet.

Very intense work environment ,Everyone is so on edge all the time making it difficult to work as a team. I wouldn’t say that this a the worst job ever but it is very mentally taxing. The manager lacks patience and understanding. They don’t train you well b/c they are so busy all the time. The main focus seems to be speed rather than your actual work ethic. If you have anxiety like me I’m going to just say that it will make you even more anxious. I wouldn’t recommend this be a long term workplace but maybe just a stepping stone to prepare you for other environments in pharmacy. Don’t expect to learn much fast they definitely take there time in that department.,2,Former Employee,Pharmacy Tech in Training ,1725 new hope church road,3/23/22,2022,3,23

High paying,You are paid well at Walmart but don’t expect to be paid fairly. I stock 9 hours of freight each night when the expectation is 6.5 hours. I get paid the same amount as people who can only stock 5 hours. ,5,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Wooster, OH",3/23/22,2022,3,23
Management was horrible,"The workload expected of any given person was way too high, and the managers never assigned an appropriate amount of people to finish a section. There was a lot of favoritism and they always expected you to stay past your shift to finish the ridiculous amount of work assigned. The training was very poor, most of their being videos you watch online which have nothing to do with the actual duties assigned to you. And they won't tell you how to do anything, they just tell you what section you're working and leave you to figure it out, but scold and reprimand you for making mistakes or doing something differently than they want it done, as if you could read their mind and know what they want.

An okay place to work,"Walmart did not interview me at all, just called and asked if I was reliable and then I was hired. The work isn’t hard, just keep stuff organized and help customers. However, management is not great. I’ve had to ask for multiple schedule changes because they’ve continued to schedule me on the days I told them I could absolutely not work. I’ve also had my schedule changed the day before, so I was supposed to be off and then they scheduled me to come in the very next day. They will tell you to do 5 different things and expect it to be done immediately, even when you are clearly busy doing something else.

Management and hourly Team Leads will pressure you to always work harder no matter how hard you work, nothing you do is good enough. Team work is hit or miss, don't count on getting help from other associates.

Cons and Few Pros ,"What I didn't appreciate was being treated different after being in a custody battle, our management was horrible since they were never there. I was never introduced to any one of them so I had to figure everything out on my own or through other associates. No registers were operated 80% of the time, and favoritism is huge at the location I worked at.

Dont do it,"They will over work you as soon as your hired, I was hired part time and broke 45 hours first week and if I declined overtime I was given points for work abandonment even though they knew I had a second job which I consequently lost, the management is out to get you if you ask questions might just be my location but the people that make manager or team lead ither are workhorses and will trample over you or do as little work as possible and will actively play a part in your downfall if you make a small inconvenience for them such as asking when you get paid because you haven’t been paid in three weeks. All in all unless you wanna sell your soul for measly pay and a terrible work environment just go work fast food and try to get a management position there it’s so much easier in my opinion and it’s compensated by pay unlike Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Pinellas Park, FL",3/22/22,2022,3,22

"Tedious, a lot of pressure",It was your average job. I worked in cap 2 so I was responsible for unloading the trucks and stocking the products onto the sales floor. There was a good amount of pressure every shift due to us having to unload the truck first and then sticking everything before we clocked out.,3,Current Employee,Merchandiser/Receiver ,"South Gate, CA",3/22/22,2022,3,22

High expectations with very little staff. Great Pay and Benefits/Stock Options,"Imagine being a mechanic and needing to fix a car but you are missing tools. Thats life as a Front End Team Lead at Walmart. Missing staff and resources, in my store I was overseeing apparel sometimes, dealing with the instore mcdonalds, having 1 person at service desk , half the recommended cashiers due to bad hiring quotas in my store. It REALLY depends on what store you are working in. Make sure the people lead is good where you are and there isnt a shortage of staff. They will NOT help you, they will expect you to ""get it done"" as a manager.Other then all this, great opportunities for advancements and amazing management team. My store manager was amazing and I learned so much from him I was happy to work there for the short time, but the understaffed workplace was not something I could do. Also the rotation style schedule is a let down. (No set Schedule)",3,Former Employee,Front End Team Lead ,"Islandia, NY",3/22/22,2022,3,22
Its a cluster f*ck,"They do have good benefits if you know how to get them. They are flexible with your schedule, but you will lose hours . They only hire part time. The management is as bad as most of the team in ethics and communication. The 3rd party leave system is a joke and they are a hyper redundant system for a company that should be able to mitigate its own employee leave locally. From management to training, it is highly inefficient and not conducive to a team work environment. Wether you're working there or shopping, you better already know where things are, cause help is far and fleeting.",2,Current Employee,Stocking Associate ,"Sumter, SC",3/22/22,2022,3,22
"It's a job, nothing more","I was really excited about starting a career there after my initial interview. I was originally told that I would be contacted within 2-4 days. It was almost two weeks before I heard anything from them; and the only way I did, was because I called them myself after I waited longer than expected. I was told that I would be hired for one position and the first day I started,they put me in a totally different position. The job was good at first, but after a few months, I had to part. The communication between management and associates is horrible. You are told to do one thing, but expected to do another. They make you do stuff that isn't explained in the initial interview or first day and they really like to play favorites. I was very disappointed and would not recommend. This is coming from someone with much retail and management experience. ",2,Former Employee,Walmart OGP ,"Terre Haute, IN",3/22/22,2022,3,22
"Managament rude ,not wanting to listen,took advantage of you to point u didnt wantto try your best best anymore..Showed favorites",Would have been nice if everyone treated equal.Letting you do your job instead of making you do others then when your review came around taking away from you because your job couldnt get done and not wanting to listen when this was expressed.Was glad to leave.,3,Former Employee,price changer ,Zanesville ohio,3/22/22,2022,3,22

Good easy money bad management ,"Management is the worst part of working at/for Walmart. Not everyone is treated fairly. Pay is good and benefits. Can’t trust no one, loads of drama and people who have been there for over 10-20 years that will do anything to have it their way. Lord of favoritism goes on in this place.

Horrible management but decent pay,"Hire managers from outside who have no warehousing experience whatsoever instead of advancing people who’ve been there for years and have worked in multiple departments.

Terrible Management,Management is terrible. Unless you're a brown noser you are treated like feces and they like to run short handed so the extra money goes into their bonus checks so you are expected to do 3 peoples work for 1 persons pay.,1,Current Employee,Produce Associate ,"Adrian, MI",3/22/22,2022,3,22

Hard work with constant gaslighting,"From the very top down Wal-Mart likes to tell its employees that the goals are higher than they actually are set. The company culture normalizes gaslighting. The lowest level of leadership, the team leads, get bullied by upper management to make up shortfalls when goals aren't met. It only takes a team lead being ""asked"" to do overtime a couple of times to clear pallets from the floor before they become complete bears about managing their teams and start buying into the practice of lying outright to employees about how much work there is to do.The actual goals for the night crew restocking shelves are practical if every person on a team is pulling their weight and no one calls out. That never happens. It was a running joke that nearly everyone had 4 occurrences. The system allows for 5 before new employees are fired, and allows the use of PTO to prevent occurrences, so employees were regularly spending all their PTO and then calling in sick too.Despite that, entire teams ended up with their hours cut right after the holiday season finished. Happy New Year, if you were depending on the income a full 40 hours a week gave you good luck! Affected associates found new jobs and were happier for it.",3,Former Employee,TA Associate ,Utah,3/22/22,2022,3,22
"Depending on position, can be pretty easy!",I loved working for Walmart. Things are a little complicated to get started but well worth it. I worked at night and was a stocker and loved it!

Needs a lot of work.,"let’s be honest, the only real reason they call you in for an interview is because everyone else quits and Micromanagement always by managers that don’t know how to manage yet alone communicate with one another. Doesn’t matter what your position is. you’ll most likely be pulled often to other departments because it’s short staffed. Id say work there a year, get experience, grow some tough skin, and get out as soon as you can.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,USA,3/21/22,2022,3,21
It's a Job,"Walmart is an O.K. place to work as long as you don't have too many bills or such. It's a great first job, but advancing through the company is difficult, as management pulls strings to advance who they want. Overall, it's a job. Wouldn't recommend making a career out of it if you can't get past the associate level. Workplace politics are a huge play in how a store operates.",3,Current Employee,Team Associate ,"Kendallville, IN",3/21/22,2022,3,21

Not the Family it Thinks it is.,"For all the hype about the ""family"" that associates have, this is not true.  It is all ""One Best Way"" or no way.  I tried to improve a position and got fired for not following One Best Way.  Managers are non-supportive and typically know little more than the associates.  Not a place I'd want to spend 20+ years.  Most operations of the store can be handled by kids directly out of high school who need a launch pad for life, but i would never advise it for a career.  The innovation sucks, the equipment hardly ever works, and there is never enough staff to get the work done on time so you are always late.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Tomah, WI",3/21/22,2022,3,21

Very Fun Work ,"As an automotive tech, the days In the shop fly by. Usually pretty busy for the most part. But management doesn’t care about you. I work in a section that brings in around 40-50% of Walmarts money but can’t get a pay raise. The training was also a JOKE. Luckily I was placed around a great group of guys (more then half are gone) who taught me the job. No assistant manager, no manager for auto, and no bay supervisor. Well we have one but he knows nothing about the job lol. Good luck of you choose this path. ",3,Current Employee,Lube Technician ,"Phoenix, AZ",3/21/22,2022,3,21
Lots of turnover,You are given a three week schedule yet those Hours and days can change quickly sometimes with little notice and if you don't catch it you will be held responsible.With team leads and managers all giving workers instructions that quite often vary widely based on their needs causes many jobs you might have been working on to be incomplete. ,3,Former Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"N Myrtle Bch, SC",3/21/22,2022,3,21
"Good to pay bills, that is all","Management is the number one reason for high turnover. It is physically demanding but that’s not the determining factor.

As middle of the road as a job can get,"It's exactly what you might expect working on cars. Nothing too complicated, just oil changes, tire changes, headlight replacements. In the summer the heat can get pretty unbearable, especially working down in the pit doing lower bay oil changes on hot engines. Due to the nature of the work, workplace can get a bit toxic with the ""man up"" attitudes. You'll have to either ignore that or shut it down immediately. Overall not terrible, not great. No real chances for advancement, but if you're in TLE, one of the benefits is not having to deal with the rest of the store, so moving into management shouldn't be a priority anyway.",3,Former Employee,Automotive Technician ,Missouri,3/21/22,2022,3,21
Hard to Work For,Walmart can be a very hard company to work for. Management can be corrupt and play favorites when it comes to promoting. Communication is lacking.  I would suggest looking at other options before going there to work. ,3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Tell City, IN",3/21/22,2022,3,21

Future Growth feeling is strong here over all,"This is one of the greatest companies I have ever worked for. I go to work with the view that every day is a football game. First quarter is up until first break, halftime is at lunch, fourth quarter is after 2nd break. When you get to the point, like I have, that any customer asks you where anything is at in the store and you can not only tell them the isle it's on but about how high on the shelf and where exactly... wow. That's an amazing feeling. It's a strong company.There are some internal problems though. Transfers seem to trigger more transfers as friends tend to follow friends. It ends up getting into a sinking ship effect and I don't know that there's any real solution to this. Over all - VERY strong and trustworthy company.

Not a good place to work.,"Working at Walmart was like being in high school. Pretty toxic work environment, with mentally stunted managers who appear to be rectifying the fact that they weren't popular in high school, and now act as if they're the cool kids on campus.

Awful leadership and hard workers are punished rather than rewarded,"Every store is different but in my particular store the leadership is terrible, the head store manager since coming to our store over a year ago hasn't even introduced herself to an entire shift. Instruction is often contradictory and there's no positive feedback, only threats and retribution for honest mistakes whether from lack of training or cutting corners to meet unrealistic demands.

No one wants to work for someone that clearly does not have any experience doing what they are doing. Bad management.

Incompetent management/low wage/Hard work as unloader ,"Cap 2 freight stocker/unloader. You start your day gathering as a group and chanting useless singing style type verse  how the company is great and why you love working there. Then you proceed to spread out according to your schedule. Some employees go inside the store to stock freight some stay in the back unloading trucks. Unloading trucks is not easy especially during the summertime. It gets extremely hot inside the truck and you are doing physical labor. You come out of the truck with extreme sweating. During the holiday season you can expect  2 trucks everyday. Since it’s a physical labor job especially when you are unloading the truck it is also injury prone. Since my time there a couple of employees were injured. Co workers is what makes this job fun. Shift leads are are not bad but the upper management is incompetent, uncaring and won’t listen to your suggestions or concerns. Extremely poor communication between the management.

Management single-handedly ruins almost everything ,"In my opinion, it doesn’t seem like there are any proper qualifications to become a manager. Managers at my store are notorious for giving tasks outside of your job description. And although those time are sometimes necessary, the job that you were hired for gets neglected, and you getting in trouble as a result. They’ll basically gaslight you into believing that you had enough time in your day to do everything asks of you, which isn’t always the case. ESPECIALLY, if what they ask you to do is completely redundant. For example, a manager asking you to repaint the bathrooms, when you’re a cashier.Communication between managers is another major problem, as well.Overall, the management team has a trickledown affect on the whole store.

No consideration over hours.,"I took a part-time job because I was looking for a 2nd job where I only had to put in 20-30 hours a week.

Would I come in during the morning, afternoon, evening, or night? Who knows! But I sure had to stay there 6-7 hours when I did. Even after filing a request for more consistency in my schedule, management did not help at all and continued. The most irritating part however was the clear exploitation by consistently scheduling me 37-38 hours a week, just low enough so I didn't qualify for full time benefits.

Night shift was more bearable on me physically, and most of my team was awesome and so nice, but I had a single team lead that made working there terrible. What's worse is that he has been reported to the company more than once, yet he never improved. It has come to the point where workers have to snap at him to make him stop for the shift.

Management hit or miss,The work is fine but how much you enjoy being there depends on the management during the day. You have good managers who support you and listen and you have managers who bully and belittle you. ,2,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Gilbert, AZ",3/18/22,2022,3,18
Recomendable con reservas ,"El primer año que trabajé ahí casi renunció porque mi jefa me acusó de tener una relación con un director, que en primera fue mentira y en segunda mi trabajo era impecable. Después de hablar con la gerente, afortunadamente me ayudó y pude sobrellevar ese tema y todo marchaba bien. Hasta que contrataron a un subdirector que era machista y, tanto a mi como a otras mujeres, nos ponía el pie. Traté de reportarlo con la directora y le echó la culpa a sus gerentes y cuando pedí hablar con la VP, tanto el subdirector, como la directora la llenaron de mentiras y me corrieron. La VP, a pesar de su política de puertas abiertas, me canceló la cita que previamente me concedió. Hay mucho machismo en esta compañía.

Life vs Work,"If you are an associate then this is great for you. Easy tasks but you run around a lot. When its time to go its time to go. Easy to promote long as you keep to yourself (No Gossip). If you want to move up the longer you work but pay is good. Most management know very little, rare to find someone knowledgeable. Depending on location great place. If only everyone did their job right this would get a 5 stars.",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Bakersfield, CA",3/18/22,2022,3,18
A decent play to work part time,"I was a stocker, and the pay was decent towards my last few weeks there. However, the store was not organized and I felt too stressed out with answering customer questions, fixing the shelves, and stocking the new items on time. I loved my coworkers though, and in my experience, the customers were nice. I just didn’t feel like I was fast enough to meet the time demands.",3,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Mays Landing, NJ",3/18/22,2022,3,18

Decent for what you need,Management can be better at helping you but with the right teamwork energy it's a sometimes fun job. Customers are often impatient and sometimes rude. I was mainly thrown in with little training but it's an easy to learn process.,3,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Linden, NJ",3/18/22,2022,3,18
High production levels and fun work environments overall.,"I really enjoyed being a stock associate for this company.

"PTO, Benefits, discount, friendship ","They have good pto and provide healthcare to employees, it’s not the best but it works if you just starting out. The pto builds up very slowly for part timers if your full time you’ll have plenty of pto. There is nothing necessarily wrong with the people that work at Walmart. It’s the company. I was told that they have a limit of people they can hire within a time period even if someone quits. I worked there for 2 years and I had gotten a raise the first year but the second year they took it off and added the second “yearly raise” they didn’t want to double my pay. There is always conflict between employees pointing fingers at who’s not doing what, it causes conflict and negativity in the workplace. Other than the conflict, if you are a good worker and mind your own business you should have a great experience with the employees. You also build great relationships with managers and coworkers ",4,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Morrilton, AR",3/18/22,2022,3,18
"Lies, lies, and just don’t go there. ","This company is the most idiotic company I have ever seen. I have been trying to move up for 3 years now with no success. The managers, especially mine, don’t train leaders. They just want you to stay in that position. I was lied to about getting full time. If I worked sundays, worked weekends, and had school only two days a week, then I would get full time. When it came time, never happened and I never got the benefits of full time. One major benefit being 6 weeks of paid leave when you have a child. The company gave everyone a dollar raise, but took away the quarterly bonuses. The company does not recognize hard work at all.

Depends on which location you work at,"There was a lot of favoritism and little to no room for growth at the location I worked at.

If you’re a hard worker, you’ll be worked to death and never given anything to show for it.

Uncaring Management and No Work/Life Balance.,"Every day is super busy. There's a high turnover rate and a lot of times people call off. The point system is terrible and unforgiving. Management/HQ does not care if you are sick, have an appointment, or have any emergencies and will try to pry into your personal life for answers on whatever they want to know.Coworkers at times can be helpful and great to talk with throughout the day, but some can be lazy and hide from doing any work. There is no work/life balance. If you ask for a desired schedule you 99.9% of the time will not get what you ask for. Or you will, but management will change it without you knowing. Always pay attention to your schedule on your days off because they will change it without telling you.Customers are also very unforgiving for any issue imaginable. Just because you work for Walmart doesn't mean you can be someone's punching bag for any reason. No benefits whatsoever. No OT. Managers lie a lot, even about company policies that exist/don't exist.You will not earn PTO or vacation time unless you are a full time employee, which is very hard to get. No matter what position you are in it's extremally hard to get any time off even if months in advance. Management will expect you to find someone to cover you when you can't come in when that is their job that they get paid for, not you. Career advancement is difficult to achieve. Pay in every position is horrible. New employees get paid slightly more than current ones which is highly unfair.",1,Former Employee,Electronics & Photo Associate ,"Altoona, PA",3/17/22,2022,3,17

But when they couldn’t help we had to go to higher management they never helped because they don’t care about the employees.

Loved working there. Kept busy and it went by fast.,I have a disability and I always have to show people I can do my job as well as anyone else. I proved that but the management team I had let the part timers do the things I wanted to do. Just because these people had full time jobs elsewhere makes them the ones who get treated in higher up positions because of favoritism? It shouldn't but it did. But I did prove what I am capable of. Bottom line. It is just sad to prove yourself and still get treated less than when we don't get to choose whether or not we are born with a disability.

Worst Walmart Ever Built (poor management),"Management don’t care about you, they overwork you even though they should be fixing management.They don’t update their equipment to how my old Walmart does things to make it easier for employees. Because if they did, then customer satisfaction would be met.I hate the fact that they think it’s the customers, but it’s really the managers and the fact that they can’t run things properly to satisfy customers.The bright side is, there’s employees who can teach you way better than managers.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Renton, WA",3/16/22,2022,3,16

Varies from walmart to walmart,"I enjoyed my last Walmart, but this one I transfered to simply doesn't uphold itself to the same standards. The pay is currently goos for the work, I mean walmart being as large a corporation it is, it has better ajusted to this crazy inflation age quicker. Plus being unskilled labor, I mean just a tough position for other companies to compete.Large corporate system means they work very thoroughly to cover their own butts to ensure they don't get any lawsuits, so you have that level protection insuring they don't work you too hard, and your accomodated decently. Just consider the family life toll, working on weekends means most people will miss a lot of potential great memories with family and friends. Then working every major holiday except Christmas is a rather large drag, you end the year with fewer of those great memories you know you miss having. My walmart experience was much better at my last store, I don't think I would enjoy being hired in at this store. They don't hire people in at set shifts(unless overnight, or second), and then they only seem interested in stacking the part time section. I've also experienced being lied to by management. Lying about schedules, willing to accommodate others, while not willing to accomodate me... ",3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Albemarle, NC",3/16/22,2022,3,16

Your Market Director Makes All the Difference,"As a current pharmacy manager I can say that Walmart is the best retail to work for. However, your market director plays a direct role in your stress level. Walmart H&W continues to care less and less about its employees because the leadership has no clear vision and they don't stay the course. Constantly moving the goal post, constantly changing what's important, just so regionals can get promoted. ",3,Current Employee,Pharmacy Manager ,"Greenville, SC",3/16/22,2022,3,16
"Great Job, terrible management ","This could be an amazing place to work. It is built to provide a strong satisfying experience. However the managers are not into people. They have no balance. They make you feel like a robot! You may be working your butt off, coming in on time, never calling out and excited about your job but if you are not moving like a 19 year old spring chicken it really won't matter. The management won't consider practical things. The expectation is not personal. That's the biggest issue. Nothing about the individual person seems to be considered at all. I have never felt like I had a solid job since I've been there. There is no making them happy! So after a while you just stop caring or trying. They blow the wind out of your sail! I feel anxiety and stress, so much so that I now don't even want to go most days.

I worked there for 6 years,"The pay was competitive but as soon as I started, I was thrown in to my work. The training was for 1 area but the management expected me to run 5 areas and not get paid for any of the knowledge. Our management was filled with idiots who have no care for personal problems of the associate. During covid they didn't even clean the machines for the elderly. We also rarely received out bonus due to our store management letting people steal merchandise which does come out of the bonus amount. The customer is always right even if they spit in your face.

Stay clear,"Walmart has a lot of diversity and inclusion statements that mean nothing when it comes to the actual  work place. This includes the constant bias towards POC. If you are hired into a management position as a POC, make sure you save your money. Because you will not be treated the same. The standards of the majority will not be the same for you. Take what you can out of the experience then go. Because chances are, from the time you were hired, someone amoung your team, is looking for ways to get you fired.

If you are sick they do not rake doctors notes and does not care; get sick at work they force you to stay. Something out of the ordinary such as snow or flat you get in trouble.

Everyone is not paid fairly, I Could write a tell all book about the mismanagement, favoritism , and unfair treatment of people of color. If you refuse to drop everything and report to work you are looked at as a poor member of management that doesn’t care even if you work 15 hour days.

Toxic middle Management and toxic associates ,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work for the company as a whole. There are people at this particular location who are in mid level management positions that have no business being in those positions. Their attendance policy is a total joke!!!!! A doctors note from a doctor is NOT recognized by management as an excused absence. There’s tattletales who will get you put on managements radar through no fault of your own. In orientation they paint it like your standing in a field of daisy's and the sun is shining bright in the sky once your like two to three months in is when the rainstorm happens.

Its great place to work to earn some quick easy money but not a permanent job ,"Overall my time with Wal-Mart has its up and downs. I mean the pay is ok but this day in age I can barely afford things I need. I enjoy the people I work with but sometimes when I need management help their off doing other things. When working I always want to seek an advancement in the workforce but with this their is no sense of motivation. You'll hear the stress the supervisor/ management  go through and trying to pass the job off to someone else is like a hot potato. With the pay it's like equal pay with everyone else and where I work where its typically a ""technician"" position. You at least should be paid more than someone who runs the cash registers or somebody stocking shelves. The work environment is fun for someone looking to get into automotive industry learning a little about cars but that should be it. Overall being where I'm at knowing it's ""Customer Service"", you would most of the time get a rude customer downgrading you showing no respect to you or telling you how it is when it's your job to fix their problem. The scheduling is an issue I would be scheduled on my desired day off or be scheduled to work for 4 hour in a day not completely getting a 40 hour work week. Finally with the people I work with its just gives me a headache sometimes with some people wandering off when a vehicle needs to be worked on, or people not coming into work and becoming shorts staffed when we already are as is.

Poor management and lack of advancement,"There is a terrible work/life balance. I am constantly getting phone calls and text messages asking me to come into work or talking about work related things when I am off the clock. If you wish to move up in the company, I wish you luck. There is no training provided and if you are not liked by management you are unlikely to move up. Associates are often hostile to one another and no action it taken to alter the environment. Many areas are often understaffed and many do no care. You will be expected to complete the work of five people, as one person. ",1,Current Employee,E-commerce Personal Shopper ,"Reynoldsburg, OH",3/14/22,2022,3,14
"Lots of overtime, short breaks","Workload varies daily, and instead of sending you home early, they would rather cross-train you in another department. The more you know how to do, the more choices you have if an issue occurs on your primary job. For example, if you're an order filler and the conveyor breaks, they may send you to shipping to load trucks, or stocking to replenish the shelves. But there is a chance, however slim, that they may send you home early if there isn't enough work. Treasure those days.Breaks are short, and timed from your last completed task, so you must factor in time walking back and forth to the break room (and sometimes through security) on your own. They occasionally treat you to lunch, but you still have to find time to eat it.They are all about hitting the quotas, so expect to have to explain yourself if you run into obstacles.  Don't be shocked if the obstacles are beyond your control, and they don't see it that way. Management seems to feel you can always work harder or smarter.The equipment would break frequently (probably from overuse, they almost never shut down), which could make your job much harder, depending on what it is and how fast maintenance could get to it. I was trained well, but I'm sure people who were hired later on were not. Plus there's many tricks you only learn on the job, which would have helped a lot from the start. They warned us in training that the schedule depends on their needs, and it's true. I was hired to work Tue-Fri, with an occasional Sat or Sunday.

Shopping ,"Grocery shopping wasn't my favorite thing before the coronavirus pandemic, but once March lockdowns and quarantines began, I absolutely dreaded it.

It is retail in every aspect from disorganization to lack of clear direction and sorted management,"I worked for Walmart for off and on 7 years and learned quite a bit of skills that would push me forward if I continued in a path of either Walmart or retail. It is dreadfully boring work and it won't take long for a person to learn not only the ins and outs of their job, but various ones throughout the store. I never found it mentally stimulating, only mentally stressful. With retail comes a varied workforce and often in retail thrives in drama and gossip. Favoritism and inconsistent direction is a regular and even talented workers are often overlooked for promotion in lieu of others who are more ""social"" with management. I regret my time spent in retail. None of the skills really splash over to any other career other than another retail establishment.

It’s okay ,Walmart expectations of its employees is absolutely ridiculous they expect you to get things done is short amount of time even if you’re the only person and have 0 help . Management likes to change you’re lunch from time to time it usually starts at 6pm for cap 2 but sometimes starts at 7 depending on how busy the crew is .not everyone you work with at this location is nice some associates will talk tons of lies  about you and complain nonstop even when you put in 100 percent no one is ever satisfied . ,3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Raynham, MA",3/13/22,2022,3,13

Miserable Work Experience For Most,"Worked here for almost 3 years and it's very stressful, was alright before but turned for the worst.

And it was only 1 or 2 managers that were supportive and appreciated you for your had work. I always worked hard and believed in giving my all at work I LOVED MY POSITION! Walmart no longer care about their associates like they use to in the 90's & early 2000's. Management is now trained not to care and to not treat associates like people.

Also no way to communicate with them immediately if there were something to happen. they play favorite and it shows. They waited until right before the 3 month probationary period ended to fire me, supposedly for attendance. Even though I only called in twice, had 0 no call no shows, and was NEVER late. This was also coincidentally after I had confided in them that I was struggling with mental health issues. Strange timing but I don’t have the energy to fight it. In the end, terrible company.

No promise of growth little to no raise and my one perk which was unlimited PTO didn’t seem to exist … they literally scheduled shoots when I had approved time off and had to keep rescheduling.

Working there is fun unless you get stuck behind a cash register ALL THE TIME. I recommend moving around the store and learning how everything works so you don't get bored doing just one role, if your manager will let you try new things do it.Working in online grocery pick up is fun and easy but it can be very stressful when the workload is very large and there aren't enough employees expect trouble.

If not, be ready for other managers in other departments to rampage through your area and start bossing everyone around. Once a manager starts rampaging, try to get as busy as possible or they will pull you aside to go work on all kinds of other things. Don't be surprised if your own tasks are put on the backburner when this happens. Just roll with it, and explain that you were not able to complete them because another manager pulled you aside to do something else for a few hours.

busy work but constantly changing procedures,Inventory Associates had from 10PM to 3AM to finish the picklist some of which exceeded 2000 items. Constant changing of procedures from management and home office made working this job a headache near the end of my employment. A few times I was required to do the entire picklist myself.

Terrible work environment. Terrible management. Terrible policies holding employees down.,"The worst job i’ve had by far. A burden has been taken off of my heart, mind, and shoulders when i left. I’ve never been so happy. management does not want to see you succeed because in their eyes you are their competition. Walmart is a cesspool of unintelligent, selfish fools.

"Diverse coworkers, bad management","While I was here cap 2 made 12 for doing the freight for the whole store. Not great. But the coworkers I had were always pretty cool. I made good friends, so we had tight teams when we could get people who stayed here for a while. Even on ogp/opd my team and I were close. But, I worked random shifts sometimes, was expected to and assumed supervisor roles without any... raise.. or anything. In fact. I didn't get a raise the whole three years I was there, until the pay increase to $16 for freight and online. Management was rude, downright mean, naggy, ""finish picks so I can go home I want to go home"" to leave me to watch minors with no management to be found on our side of the store until 9.

Terrible management ,Will hire you with your stated availability and then once you start they will demand you change it or they will take your position away. Management are bullies. Poorly paid for the amount of work they demand you finish. You are belittled if you can’t finish the insane amount of tasks given. They also favor certain employees and remove points for them.

Job would not be bad with more supportive management.,"Honestly, to understand jobs better, this is coming from a CAP2 associate. Our job consists of unloading two trucks, one with a machine, one without, and to stack it all on pallets and move freight to the store. This is extremely vigorous, so if you have any health ailments at all, I'd not recommend. We have had such a high turnover rate, that the crew is now skin and bones.

Typical job. Bad work/life balance ,"Not a bad place to work and has great benefits. They have both PTO and PPTO (which you'd use for sick days or personal when already scheduled). Basically with no limit on how many hours earned, but can only carry over some into the new year (rest is paid out in cash).  They say at the orientation that if you request at least a month in advance, before the new schedule is made, that you can request an unpaid day off. This is important as a single parent. However, they actually don't do that. You are forced to use your paid time off. And then on top of that, they will still put you on 40hrs a week. So basically you're getting your vacation time robbed from you. As a widowed parent of 2 special needs kids, the pressure was getting to me after 2.5 yrs and I was forced to leave due to childcare. Even when I attempted to change my availability, it wasn't going through fast enough. After several weeks of trying to make this happen, I used up all my PPTO and eventually had to leave.

Okay for short term work,"The managers pick and choose which rules to follow and enforce. When seeking assistance from Management you are often ignored if you belong to certain departments.

Asset protection,Asset protection at Walmart at this 7th st in Las Vegas New Mexico is a joke. No management of Staff focus is on shoplifting but they apply a catch-and-release method so it does nothing to prevent shoplifting or discourage it.

The job was overall ok,"My main complaint would be thats its very difficult to get enough hours to make up for the low pay (depending on position). Not many people care about doing the job correctly so those who do tend to get pulled to take over for others who don't. For those who are responsible and take pride in their work, will get taken advantaged of. The cashier job specifically can be mentally draining due to being pressured to constantly smile and pretend to be happy even when insulted, especially when trying to work more hours. If a customer senses even a smidge of unhappiness, they will go out of their way to make it worse. I know customers can be frustrating no matter where you are or what you do, but walmart customers can be somewhat scary and much more upsetting.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Walker, LA",3/9/22,2022,3,9

Pros and cons,"The job as a stocker was easy. What made it hard was fellow employees and no communication from management. The store managers don't bother themselves with overnight shifts except when something goes wrong. Very strict with their attendance policy,  which would be fine if the people who did show up were made to do their jobs. That brings morale down when you have to do your part, then go behind and finish someone else's job because they don't care whether products get stocked or not. You tend to not want to be there when there's no balance with tasks. Overnight management were fine, but there is no real communication with them. You can never find them if you have an issue. They won't enforce the rules for everyone and get their teams aligned. Pay was great, benefits good, just need more communication between the store management and leads. No one on any other shift knows anyone else. That's rough too.",3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Knoxville, TN",3/8/22,2022,3,8
Don’t work at Walmart ,When I first started working at Walmart NONE of the managers actually train you. They rather leave that to one of the other employees working along side with you who’s been working there for awhile. They only give you 15 minutes breaks but expect you to unload 2 trucks everyday. If you try to schedule time off you probably won’t get paid for it. ,2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Louisville, KY",3/8/22,2022,3,8
Awful treatment,"Don't work here. Managers don't back you up, there is no recognition for hard workers at all. Store is super understaffed but upper management can't figure out how to retain employees at all. ",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Cerritos, CA",3/8/22,2022,3,8
Boring ,"The first year you work there, you will only get feeder growers regardless of experience. You have to “prove” to management that you “earned” the right to take care of level 3 and 4 babies. Management does not listen to suggestions/ ideas unless you are favorited by them. Scheduling is also decided by a committee who plays favoritism. Very gossip oriented work environment.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Fayetteville, NC",3/8/22,2022,3,8

I like working with so many different people and customers. It's a lot of fun. The pay could be better, but recently Walmart has stepped up its game and increased its wages, which is a definite plus.

I had taken all my assessments and even got my schedule switched but never a raise or title. When. People would quit they wouldn't replace them nor bump your pay up for doing the work of 3 or 4 men. Me and a few guys ran the whole shop for months. Managers sit around and make double what you do. You were a floater and they always brought up that it was in the fine print of your contract to do whatever it is they want you to do at any time.

Great Benefits Despite Company Exploiting Employees ,"Despite having great benefits when I worked for Walmart, I do not recommend working there as a full-time career.

If you work in apparel, not only do you take care of the jewelry department and fitting rooms, you are also called to cover the front end registers for hours at a time, electronic department, and more. You will be spread very thinly if you work here. If you are putting an overloaded skid of clothing out for the new seasonal change and have a deadline of when it needs to be finished, do not expect to get it all done on the account for the front end managers needing cashiers so they pull you up. Then you will be reprimanded for your lack of productivity because you were on register for the majority of your shift.

When planning the move I spoke to management at several stores who said they would be more than happy to find me a position once I was in state. When I got in state, they wouldn't even talk to me (in person or over the phone). One manager even told me to call the next day, left me on hold for 2 HOURS and then hung up on me.

I dunno,"Wal-mart as a company isn't horrible to work at. However in my experience favoritism and support from management is lacking. There is a lack of appreciation within wal-mart managers.

Bad place to work. ,Market managers are the worst in the industry and do not possess even basic grammar skills.

Poor Management,"My experience working at Walmart was a joke. My manager was nowhere to be found for the first two to three weeks after I was hired and the associates I worked with refused to properly train me. In the end, I only knew what I needed to just barely get by. I recall meeting another associate who had worked with Walmart for two years and was never trained. I was scheduled to work alone in my department on my first full day with no instruction. There is zero communication between anybody which makes for a very unorganized work environment. Whenever I brought an issue up with managers, nothing was ever done about it. I think it's ironic that the company preaches about teamwork, yet ""teamwork"" is nowhere to be found outside of the cliquey management circle.

Even if the store doesn't have on the floor its your fault if you don't pick the items. When dispensing the orders out sometimes customers don't get the orders because the system won't drop the picks until 2+ hours late or we have too many customers and not enough people to bring out orders.

"Good pay, but for some job will wear you down. ","When you first start at the contact center you’ll be promised the world, and will probably believe it to some extent. Then, the subtle, but steady changes will start. Little things that slowly make your job worse in some way. In the CC it’s usually policy changes within specific teams, but issues with under and even over staffing are evident. I am fairly paid, treated with respect from management and the benefits are hard to beat. That being said my position has changed dramatically. When I first started, my role was exciting and ever changing. I was tasked with finding the solution to any given problem within my department. I was valued for my ability to think outside the box and to find uncommon solutions. Then, my abilities were slowly curtailed. Blanket rules were instated and independent thinking went from making you a go-getter to someone who is difficult. Good workers were chased off and those who had the right relationships were promoted over those who were better for these roles. My department is now a shadow of its former self. Monotony is the overarching theme of my job now. It’s still what I would consider an okay job, and I would recommend it, but only for those who are more unaffected by monotony, increasingly aggressive micromanagement, and becoming entangled in a bitter game of inner office politics. I would also like to note that the company from what I’ve seen and heard from others is incredibly inclusive to all.

Good work environment with kind people,"A typical day at work as an OGP associate consists of either picking or dispensing. Picking= gathering groceries, putting them in totes on carts.Dispensing= collecting the scattered totes into their individual orders, delivering them to cars waiting outside.Zoning= organizing/topstocking aisles in the store, in any department.Topstocking= pulling items from the very top of the shelf to their place on the shelf.I work more in dispensing. When I first got here, the Team Leads trained me in both and let me choose which one I preferred. Since then I've gone back and forth a couple times, and they've been flexible. They've also been flexible with my schedule, as I'm a student (like most of the people in my department). The people in my department are kind and hard-working. Many of them are friends outside of work and each day I go into work glad to see them. I would say they help me get through the day, but I actually enjoy the work. It's not difficult (although it has made me gain muscle in my arms and legs) but it is very fast-paced, which makes the day stay interesting. If that's not what you're looking for, picking is the job you want. Picking is a routine job that's not too fast-paced. Just don't forget your earbuds, otherwise you'll be very bored. Once picking or dispensing are done for the day, people get pulled to zone. OGP is different for any store. I love the Moscow store. ",3,Current Employee,OGP Associate ,"Moscow, ID",3/1/22,2022,3,1

In all honesty the company gone down since they changed & gotten rid of Dept.Mgrs. They only pick random TLs.,In all it is a job that pays. But it is a hit and miss on which store that runs better than the others. In my opinion stores in Washington state runs better than the stores in Arizona and Kentucky. Up in Washington they make it fun and competitive versus down here they seem to be rude and not into making anything a contest.,2,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Phoenix, AZ",3/1/22,2022,3,1

"Good benefits, terrible work environment. ","I worked at Walmart for 8 years, two different stores. The benefits are great but the work environment is very toxic. Terrible job for a good work/life balance. They load you up with more work then the managers could even do themselves(I was a manager for 6 years out of the 8). They change their management structure so much that you’ll be re-applying for your job under a different name instead of a promotion. Customer service is not their main priority, it’s freight. If you stand up for your associates well-being they will take that as you causing problems. If you’re looking for a decent paying temporary job and don’t mind a little hard work, go for it. If you are wanting a company to move up and grow with, I wouldn’t recommend. I put in my 2 weeks after 8 years with the company. ",2,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"Haslet, TX",3/1/22,2022,3,1

No work / life balance,Even when requesting time off 6 months in advance it gets denied. Constantly. And six months is the soonest it can be requested off. Policies and rules change so frequently that it’s hard to keep up. One day they want you to do xyz and then the next week they change their mind and you’re not allowed to do that anymore and will get talked to about it even if they never told you the policy changed Lower Management is so short staffed on the weekends that if there’s an issue you’re waiting for well over ten minutes to get help assisting customers.Higher management hides in their office all day and is rarely seen even when the entire store is struggling due to their lack of diligence when they create the schedules ,1,Current Employee,Front End ,"Brockport, NY",3/1/22,2022,3,1

Too many lazy people expecting just a couple to actually do the work. I learned not to trust anyone. Management don't care if you stay or go. ,"A typical day at the service desk would include taking returns to the back, waiting on  customers that were returning things that they didn't even pay for to begin with, or  returning things in boxes that came from there, but they had switched out the items. The best part of working there was seeing all the sweet babies, and you do get to meet some good people. When I was there, management was awful as far as schedules. They would change your schedule and not tell you.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Lexington, KY",3/1/22,2022,3,1
"Stressful, and always understaffed....also, constant micromanagement.","My store seemed to never have enough people. They either called off, or just quit. This issue made it to where you were often called to go do someone else's job. So you were quite often given one task, then very quickly put onto a completely different task entirely. Most times it was having to go help ogp/odp. Other times it was running a cash register, or collecting carts from the parking lot. All of that can be very annoying when you are in charge of a department and constantly have to abandon it to cover for someone else. Also, if you're running your own department and don't have help most of the time it can be very hard to get anything done, especially with customers also needing your help. Finally, if you work day shift and overnights wasn't able to work all of their  freight, now that's your problem.",3,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Findlay, OH",3/1/22,2022,3,1

Very respectful easy going work environment!,"I honestly loved working overnight at walmart. The people and managers were super friendly and helpful. The work was a lot but everyone worked together and usually finished the job by the end of the shift. However most things are dealt with through online and automated calls so scheduling issues and call outs were difficult to handle and the managers didn't have any say in it. While they were usually understanding, the system was not easy to work with. Good job if you only want to work and don't have much life outside of that and if you don't mind hard physically demanding work. Pay was very fair but raises and promotions were little to none.

"Unrealistic expectations, often understaffed.","I liked my coworkers and most of my managers, but it seems like the expectations coming from corporate are insane, which inevitably leads to everyone desperately squeezing the person below them. My managers were reasonably nice, and often wanted to offer support, but I just got the feeling that they were drowning in the expectations thrust on us lower lever workers. This means they either pushed us harder than was realistic or did all the extra work themselves. Burnout is common amongst everyone (especially management), which leads to high turnover rates in the more dispensable positions, such as stocking. However, some departments (like online grocery pickup) are more forgiving than others.The pay rates are not horrible, but this only because it’s necessary for Walmart to have any entry-level employees at all. My store was perpetually understaffed (with most of the staff being new), and thus the few employees who were there were expected to do the work of a full group of experienced members, which again, ties back into the theme of unrealistic expectations. The company (albeit inadvertently) seems to rely on a revolving door of teens and desperate people to stay staffed because people with better options don’t stick around.Furthermore, I felt constantly dissuaded from providing quality service to customers because of the ridiculously short time windows being imposed on me. Despite this, I would often take my time to help people as best as I could because I enjoyed doing so. However, I think it says something about the company's culture when I felt pressured to NOT help - more...",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Stocking ,"Springfield, MO",2/28/22,2022,2,28

"Productive and easy tasks. Good for part-time job, easy money.","You would think working here would be a breeze wether you’re working part-time or full-time but it’s not because of the work culture.

If the work culture was better I would have stayed, at least to make a little extra money. The team leads and managers have no structure or organization going on whatsoever. The training was not beneficial and if I had my way, I probably could’ve disappeared on the clock and nobody would have notice until they would had notice. As a new hire, there was hardly any communication, nobody checked on you, the training sucked. Although i am a quick learner and the job duties are easy, I still would have like to have someone with me to make sure I did everything right at least for the first week. My first day I only had 4-6 hours of training then after that I was by myself. There were times that I had nothing to do in my department so I was left wandering around trying to figure out what to do until I could find somebody. Then they would have you do something and leave you alone and forget about you. Personally I wouldn’t want to make a career out of Walmart with this kind of work culture.

Cashier/front end host is a stressful nightmare,"Due to a change shortage, most of our self checkout machines are in Cards Only mode. Many customers have cash and while we do our best to direct them, it's not always possible when we are short staffed, and we're busy helping multiple people at a time. Many are angry that there are few cashiers and longer lines they're required to wait in, if they do use cash. All this leads to a negative environment that would wear anyone down. It's also difficult to find a manager when I need one- sending a message via company provided handheld, never gets a response back. I recommend to work anywhere except the front end if you are applying.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Self-Checkout Host ,"Largo, FL",2/24/22,2022,2,24

Not the worst for a job for a high schooler,"Honestly, I can really only say a couple good things about the job. First is pay. Especially if you were in highschool like me, the 12.50 an hour is pretty good, especially because the work itself isn't really that hard. But man. Working here kinda just sucked the soul outta me for a while. You feel like all you are to them is a mindless work robot who can be easily replaced. Management was mostly not very nice to the common cashier, and also they frequently overscheduled me. All in all, you can work here if you want, but I wouldn't stay for more than a year, because this place drove me nuts after a while.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Saratoga Springs, UT",2/24/22,2022,2,24

There’s lots of work drama and management is horrible. the pay is nice tho but considering we have to work in snow storms and extreme heat yet the stockers make more than us is a little ridiculous.

Working for Walmart was the worst days of my life. ,Walmart absolutely made me miserable. Most customers treat you life your garbage and I have literally had a few tell me to my face.

Wouldnt recommended ,Worked you like a dog without any thank you or anything. Always taking up for customers who treat us like a dog and cuss us like dirt.

Then turn around and make us look dumb for doing our JOB.,2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Texarkana, TX",2/24/22,2022,2,24
Repetitive tasks without end but decent amount of freedom depending on position and shift.,The work is tedious and repetitive. Expectations aren’t always realistic and you can’t expect much help from people. No one seems to understand protocols or know the exact way to do things so everyone gets stuck with clean up. Lots of freedom in nightshift so that’s a plus. You can listen to music or watch shows and talk to coworkers as long as the work is done. The work although is not rewarding and you don’t get a feeling of fulfillment when it’s complete. Couldn’t stand more than 3 months there. After that you don’t learn anything new and it’s just the same day over and over again.,2,Current Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,New Hampshire,2/24/22,2022,2,24

We are expanding our online orders rapidly each month even though our team is losing people pretty quickly and cannot retain the new hires.,1,Current Employee,Digital Manager ,"Moraine, OH",2/24/22,2022,2,24
Not recommended unless it's a starter job,"I work as a CAP 2 Associate on second shift. My job consists of unloading trucks, sorting break-packs (mixed boxes of freight), and stocking the shelves. This is one of the most physically demanding jobs in the store. We work in very tight quarters and must move quickly and efficiently to unload 1-2 trucks per day, many times significantly understaffed. It is common to hear management insist on moving faster and faster while they do very little and sometimes nothing to help with the work. The tight workspace in the backroom often makes it difficult to move carts and pallets, and at times, you will be almost tripping over your coworkers. Safety at Walmart tends to be an afterthought. Management varies, and some managers are great, while others are very difficult to work with. Policies, especially the attendance policy, tend to be very strict, with no room for considering extenuating circumstances. Walmart has had a very negative reputation for how they treat their workers, and they have not seemed to have changed at all for the better.Bottom line: Walmart is a decent starter job, but if you are looking for something more than that, I would not recommend working here.",2,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Cleveland, GA",2/23/22,2022,2,23

Poor management and leadership ,I worked at this store for a good while and I have seen my share of negatives and positives. Unfortunately in the end the negative things stared to outweigh the good thing. The management was severely lacking and would be quick to point the finger at associates to cover there own mistakes or to make themselves look better.

This is company that lives literally in it's own shadow and without a complete change up and down this company will join the list of companies long gone. ,1,Former Employee,Overnight ICS Associate ,"Westworth Village, TX",2/22/22,2022,2,22

Fun co-workers and awesome store manager.,"I was a Courtesy Associate, which is basically a shopping cart getter. I liked the job because I was outside getting exercise. We would bring in carts from the lot, help customers with heavy items, retrieve online orders from the back of the store, etc. The worst part about the position was bad weather. Cold, wet, wind, snow, etc. The head store manager was surprisingly nice and would come out to get carts himself every once in a while, just to rub elbows with us, joke, and boost morale.

It’s Okay,"Walmart is whatever you make of it. Personally, I like providing great  customer service. I provide the type of service I would want. Coworkers can be horrible but if you find the right ones, this job can be one you may even look forward to as long as these people are present. Management on the other hand is terrible. They don’t reward you for how well you perform at your job. The only way it seems people move up here is if you are someone’s favorite as they rarely seem to actually do job interviews to move up and even when they do it can still go to favoritism. Another thing I’ve noticed is if you do have an issue with a coworker, the more difficult person seems to get their way because it’s easier to do it their way than to fight them on it. Probably because most of management isn’t built on leadership but rather people moving up the easy way. But overall, the job can be solid. Job security is fine as long as you show up and don’t steal anything. Pay starts at $13 an hour and full time employees collect PTO and PPTO over time as well as other benefits. It’s just hard to view this as a career rather than just a job. ",3,Current Employee,Front End Service Associate ,"Glenpool, OK",2/22/22,2022,2,22
Very bad management ,"The management is horrible. I’ve always heard good things from people working at Walmart but all around I had a terrible experience.

There are drawbacks though that you have to put up with though. Recently staffing was beefed up. They make sure that new applicants know that working holidays and OT is mandatory sometimes, but they don't warn people that the reverse is true as well! Sometimes the workload drops off and you don't work all of your hours. I've worked 4 half shifts in the last couple months because of lack of work available for the number of people that we have.

It really sucks especially when you ask for help and no one else will come and help you guys. The people you meet and customer interactions are the best parts of your day.

The customers don't help. The two stores within 5mi of me both had customers physically abuse employees.

I left when corporate decided to ""restructure"", lower management - assistant manager's on down. It was really a demotion for all of them and younger people were brought in to do their jobs. Many of the leads were told that they weren't doing a good enough job, yet they were being made to train their replacements????

Things are getting worse and they stick up for the customers that berate workers and make everyone quit. We as associates are constantly overridden by managers in other areas that don’t know the area they meddle with. Coaches are constantly changing and having no idea how to do a job once switched. They have to play catch up while associates are frustrated and can’t move up even though they know the answers coaches don’t. Team leads are told to cover in other areas then yelled at and have disciplinary actions taken when their work isn’t covered.

After a while you stop asking questions and trying to make sense of things. Policies home office comes up with are regularly broken because they hinder us from getting our job done.

The management won’t let you be better. They work you like factory workers and hardly do any work themselves.,"Overall it wasn’t a good or bad experience, no job security and when you ask to learn something new and be better the managers won’t let you. The pay is good but not worth the amount of work at all. They only offered full time if you want a 9-6 or 1-10 shift.",1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Port Orange, FL",2/20/22,2022,2,20

Bad management but flexibility ,"Bad management, overwork you, flexible work schedule. The management has zero idea what they want at a given moment so they make their employees run around with their heads cut off then blame you for their problems even if you did what you were told they will still say it was wrong. Not encouraging at all. Lazy, not knowledgeable.",3,Former Employee,Multiple Positions ,California,2/20/22,2022,2,20
Mehhhh,"It was an alright job. I don’t have a lot to say about it besides I enjoyed working there before an off duty assistant manager decided to come to my department and basically cuss me out for following rules and doing my job properly and not for her benefit in my first couple of week working there.

Work hard payed less ,Well working second shift we are expected to do everyone else's work and get them set up and we are payed less then the other 2 shifts. Expectations increase everyday to make management look better well we get more and more understaffed.

You’re just a number. Never a compliment or recognition of hard work. ,"Easy to transfer and a big difference between states and stores. Great communication, management and training in Arizona, total opposite in Florida.  Too many managers.  None of them know what’s going on. No communication. Retaliatory scheduling, bullying and singling out by managers and cliches. Associates allowed to be lazy and rude without consequences. Hard workers not recognized, compensated or valued. Guess it just depends on the particular store you’re at. The pay also depends on what state you’re in. Raises are unreliable and confusing. Quarterly profit sharing is great if you’re in a well run store, otherwise not even worth mentioning. ",2,Current Employee,Service Deli Clerk ,"Tamarac, FL",2/20/22,2022,2,20
A job for you if you want management constantly breathing down your neck,"Management will jump your case for the slightest thing if your not a company favorite. If your not a favorite, they will micromanage you and give you the lowest travel loads they can. The audio and video cameras in the trucks, better watch out. Cameras trigger at the slightest thing. Car pulls out or slows down fast in front of you and you hit your brakes, the camera will go off and it’s always the Walmart drivers fault, no matter what happens. They say they installed the cameras to protect the drivers in case of an incident, but they really use them against you. Pay is decent, but you have to pretty much say goodbye to any kind of social life to work for them. This would be a great job for a single person who has no family.

Easy work. Low pay. No leadership. ,"As soon as I started they just put me out on the sales floor and basically said “good luck.” I was put with the department manager who handed me off to another associate who tried to show me something but was quickly pulled away to do something else. There’s been no proper training at all. When I am shown something it’s like “do this, this and you’re done.” Very bad. I never know what I need to be doing. I thought there needs to be a to do list. It took three months. THREE MONTHS, for me to find the daily to do list on our issues phones. (Found out on my own). There is no leadership. I walk around looking for something to do until I’m told to do something. The pay is low. I got 12/hr I think. For the minimal amount of work I do, I guess it’s okay but not for me personally. Overall, I’d say this job is good for high school students first job or someone working through college or a second job. ",1,Current Employee,Associate ,"Terre Haute, IN",2/20/22,2022,2,20

Nobody has any idea what’s going on,"Job was cool but it was impossible to find out who to talk to about scheduling issues. no one seemed to know for sure who was in charge or what steps to take to change availability. When i did finally figure out how to change availability (print out a form through the intranet while clocked in and signed in, fill it out, give it to the ‘people person’) they just ignored it. I waited 4 weeks after the 1st form I turned in to take effect - nothing. I turned in a second form, same request, and waited another 4 weeks - nothing. I couldn’t show up for work when they were scheduling me. Tried swapping individual shifts through the employee app - also ignored. Couldn’t contact anyone unless I was on the clock and we were understaffed and way behind literally all the time. I tried calling the main store itself but literally no one has ever answered that phone since the store opened in this town 20 years ago.

Toxic management and work environment ,The managers continually talk down lie to and threaten associates.  Stay away They will tell you that you can not take leave even though it is your earned time and right to do so.  If you want to move to a better or another location the manager will write you up making you ineligible for the transfer.

Very bad management and dull work environment. ,The managers are so rude to you for no reason and expect you to do the most for minimum wage and work outside of your area without being paid more or even trained for it.

Worste place to work for,Unfair management when it comes to moving up saying if you miss a day you are not dependable and cant move up when company policy allows 4 1/2 points leaving points on after initiallly quitting then coming back.

"Very stressful , too much drama",Used to be a great place to work. They continue to make so many changes in the company that doesn't work. They took away associate bonuses.

They will not recognize issues in order to fix them.,1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Bristol, VA",2/18/22,2022,2,18
BEWARE It has its pros and cons,"Favoritism is a problem in this company. Good workers get used. No weekends off ever, or weekend days off and the off days are split (M-T only). Don’t let them fool you. So if you don’t have kids, a life, or a relationship. This is perfect for you. It keeps you occupied. If a person isn’t doing their job in your area. You will have to do it for them. Very hectic and everything has to be done at a certain time. If not they will make you stay after your shift and finish it (yes even if it wasn’t yours to finish). So hopefully you get placed in a good team. Also don’t tell management you can’t do something because they don’t care and you can risk getting fired. Who cares if you have to lift 3x your weight or if you have a health issue. It’s your job. Get it done or go home is how they feel. The pay & benefits are good though.

Low wages and understaffed,"Understaffed from the moment I hired on and it never changed in two years. Management walked around the store in a group everyday acting like they were putting out fires when they just stressed everyone out even more.

You will probably quit after the second day when you show up and there’s NO training whatsoever you just show up and are out on the floor by yourself one day and then get in trouble because you don’t know the rules they taught no one in the first place.

Could be fun to work if your coach is reasonable,"Have been with Walmart for over a year in two different store. One thing that standout is their wage. I was getting more than minimum wage which is awesome. But with management, it sometime a pain because there little to no communication.

The benefits are fine, associate discount is meh, co-workers are pretty great, and the pay is good for what the job is. My biggest problem during my employment with Walmart was the management. The general lack of common sense, communication, leadership, and problem solving skills was just unreal. Nearly all of the problems my store had were a direct result of management making stupid decisions.

Some management is great but others will be Hella strict with their rules and then turn around and break the rules that want you to follow. The attendance policy is ridiculous. They also never follow their own policies and the favoritism is strong. ,2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Decatur, IL",2/15/22,2022,2,15

However, only the best are considered to get their hours, and everyone else is left to hopefully get work in other departments. They acknowledge the issue of being overstaffed, yet, they keep hiring people as if we need more. On top of that, management doesn't really do their job, rather it is left to someone else who is willing to do it, even if they aren't getting paid for it, who is left with plenty of power of who can actually get hours, often falling to favorites. The one who does all the manager work also tends to have a short temper and had many complaints against him, yet still held the position.

I haven’t been in my actual designated department but for a few hours at a time. Was told I’d have a set schedule, but I’m going from 40 one week to about 14 the next.

No training. Expects you to pick up slack instead of correcting the problems. Very bad at scheduling. Unnecessarily stressful. ,"One person makes the schedule, every week was a schedule issue. No matter what hours you gave them, it randomly changes. You can let them know abt the issues, and it will still be messed up every week. They expect you to pick up other’s slack by overworking you. Management does nothing when you tell them the problems. No training since day one. Team members have to train you if they want to, for no extra pay. They expect you to help other departments without training and extra pay. Other workers make things harder for workers by putting things in wrong places, not doing their part, not caring about other workers. Customers are rude, making this job even harder. Only good thing is the couple friends you make while working. Technology sucks there as well. Making the job even harder.

Its decent ,In my opinion the store could use some work starting with the management . The managers are okay but lack leadership skills. Noone is held accountable for their actions and management just brushes it off. There is favoritism and lack of maturity.  Honestly feels like high-school. Hours being cut does not help but I get it since the stores usually does not get shopped as much in between holidays. The managers and assistants are never on the same page and have poor communication. Other shifts do not pull their weight. Pay is great but the job is  not mentally stimulating.,2,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Weslaco, TX",2/14/22,2022,2,14
"Spacious, Productive and Stressful ","While occupying my Walmart stocker role I really did love third shift. It was quiet, no customers and pretty much no supervision, which was part of the problem. I did begin working at the start of a Pandemic, so this may also have an affect on each individuals experience there. I gathered from my evaluation that management just needs to communicate with one another to meet the daily goals. This company holds a  high employee turnover rate. There are usually not enough team members for the amount of freight that is received. So in order to meet those daily goals some people will get overworked. While other senior co-workers get minimal workloads and leave early. They will place large workloads on one person & rush them to complete, which is extremely stressful. Then may expect you to stay over. There are also too many employees micromanaging. Everyone pretty much tells one another what to do & then the managers get upset. You may be asked to complete a job that’s not in your job description or has not been taught to you. ",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"6170 Saginaw St. Grand Blanc, MI",2/14/22,2022,2,14

Not the best,"LONG UNPAID WAIT TIMES. Associates leave MANY items unbagged and you have to delivery them that way.

Company needs to go back to its roots,Used to be a decent company to work for but like all corporations management only care about how much they can bonus while killing those  that don’t want to be in management. Not everyone is cut out for supervisory jobs it does not mean that you don’t work hard. There is no rewards for working as a team and no one recognizes the quiet ones that do all the work.

Meeting new people,Walmart as a whole is a good company the store I worked in was horrible.

It was okay,Steer clear of this place. Warehouse associates are treated poorly and you're either told to quit or your job gets threatened. If you are not willing to give up your life to this job you're on the outs.Corporate has various personalities that are driving people out and the ones that actually do provide help are overloaded and blamed for what goes wrong. If you have boundaries they will turn on you and they're losing strong talent left and right because they aren't growing and Avo knows that. This place might be investor-backed but they will want to see a return at some point and there is a constant waste of money every turn you go.,3,Former Employee,Delivery Driver ,unknown,2/12/22,2022,2,12

It’s an alright job if the overnight schedule doesn’t destroy your sleeping pattern.,Overnight stocking is a very hard position.

Good place to work. ,I’ve worked for Walmart 21 plus years. I’m grandfathered in at 28 hrs. In the last 2 years since the pandemic started. The customers have made it an acid environment.

Overall ,What I’ve concluded from working at Walmart is that your experience at Walmart depends on management. My only bad days are when I’m working under poor management. The pay is reasonable.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,New Jersey,2/12/22,2022,2,12
Standard retail environment,As with most places it is run on the backs of part time employees. Unlike other places they realize they need full time workers so the part timers work a forty hour week without full time benefits.  I was expected to operate 3 departments in any given week. They have about a 95% turnover rate. The only people they keep are people who have to much time invested and are stuck. This is the only place I have ever worked where everyone  (with exception of the store manager) was unhappy and would say on a daily basis if they could find anywhere else to go they would be gone and they do. ,1,Former Employee,Deli Clerk ,"Huntsville, AL",2/12/22,2022,2,12
Fun place to work with others but sometimes management misses the mark,As long as you don't get injured Walmart has some very good benefits and not necessarily hourly pay. Unfortunately once you get injured if another associate injures you they are not always held responsible or counseled on safely. They are always rushing their stockers which leads to injuries of others. You can expect to feel extra pressure while you are recovering so enjoy the free stress.The best part of working at Walmart is the other employees in your department if you get a good one they can feel like family.Saddest part is you are often terminated unexpectedly for almost no reason.,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"London, KY",2/12/22,2022,2,12
Lack of communication with managers they can also be very rude. Work so much for so little,This was my first job and it’s not a bad job you have your bad days then you have your good days but they put you out there and expect you to do it on your own. Some managers can be very rude and little to no help at all. The only thing I like about this place is my co workers and the discount card other then that I’m not gonna miss working for this company. Expect to do a lot of work for very little pay.,3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Lancaster, CA",2/12/22,2022,2,12

Great company that focuses on growing the business and the people that work for them,"Many opportunities for advancement and learning new skills.  Scheduling flexibility is available for many hourly positions but some hourly positions have set schedules that are required to be able to complete the required work.  For those entering management positions you will need to be 100% flexible with your schedule.  The Walmart culture supports career/life balance but it is challenging as a manager.  Overall, Walmart is a great place to work.  They promote based on skills, attitude, hard work and dependability.  The door is wide open and full of possibilities for those that work hard and have positive attitudes.  ",5,Former Employee,Store Manager ,Washington State,2/12/22,2022,2,12
Bad management ,Horrible management. No one communicates what is expected of you or what your supposed to be doing. Moving up feels impossible unless you have friends higher up.

You are constantly asked to do things way above your pay-grade. ,1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper/Sales Associate ,"Elizabethton, TN",2/12/22,2022,2,12
Coworkers and most managers were nice and easy to get along with. ,"The atmosphere is fun and friendly. I’ve had some managers that weren’t very nice, and there was some favoritism. But I liked Walmart overall. The benefits and insurance was very nice. Pay was good too.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Frisco, TX",2/12/22,2022,2,12
It’s like joining a cult,Working for Walmart has its good and bad points. I worked for the company for 13 years and I have seen them change. One thing that has somehow stayed the same is the companies ability to keep its associates thinking they are part of the family. They constantly are cutting costs at the expensive of their own associates. Like when they switched to this new team lead BS. Increase pay from $12-15/h to $19-23/h but your not doing 3-4 people’s jobs ,2,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Mount Laurel, NJ",2/12/22,2022,2,12

Don’t care about new hires or availability at all,From day one this job was already kind of sketchy. They gave me a hard time about my availability at school to take time off for exams. On my first real day I was thrown into the department and was given minimal instruction. I asked if I could take my break at the given time a manager told me and another manager gave me such a hard time. They randomly added shifts to my schedule that was already made on the days that im specifically unavailable with no notice.

Grit your teeth," I've been working for Walmart for 5 years; I've helped in all the individual departments and helped restock merchandise. The job/career of Walmart isn't a bad choice & it has its ups and downs.  However in every well flourishing company there are some dead ends. Employees run the stores, Management uses standing to push people around. And above all customers are the boss.  A well oiled & maintained machine will run indefinitely. Walmart is not maintained.

They promote those who show up to work on time and are team players. Some management can be mediocre.,Advancement and pay are top notch are Walmart. Are most people start off as part time but after 90 days if they see you come to work on time every day and don’t call out they can offer you full-time positions.

Good job but with corruption,Depends on who your managers are. There is a pecking order. The management will look after one another by looking the other way to there co workers actions like breaking company policy or allowing one another to be excused to leave work when ever they please.

They don’t care about you.,It’s been a long time since I was a csm but when I was short staffed because of cashiers calling out no one came to the front when I’d call for back up. They’d always get on me for not doing 10 things at once. They’d require you to do things the hard way because of policies and inventory issues. They’d expect me to do 3 peoples job on my own and I never got to go to lunch. If I even went to the restroom I’d hear them calling for me on the walkie in leads than a minute of sitting down.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"San Antonio, TX",2/10/22,2022,2,10
The good and bad about Walmart in Raytown,The bad part of working at Walmart is there's a big problem when it comes to is that they weren't willing to work with me and let me finish one of the other applications or questionnaire. The good thing is they want me back it's just all about when I get on it is someone else because I know I can't do it. and do want to work now,2,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Raytown, MO",2/10/22,2022,2,10

"Great coworkers, really, really terrible pay, worse benefits & corporate was a dumpster fire. ","Great coworkers. Probably because we were all dirt poor due to working at Walmart. This was pre-2015, when the majority of hourly associates with families were on government assistance. Very early on, I moved up quickly & received several merit raises for excellence. They got rid of those. Hourly supervisors, such as myself, run the actual store & deal with the unreasonable customers who have been thoroughly spoiled/trained/conditioned by corporate to behave like entitled toddlers in order to get their way. Policy be damned. Salaried management mostly talk on the phone, wander around, hide in the back, & sometimes butt in where they are neither wanted nor needed because they’re clueless as to actual store operations. “Stuff” runs downhill, so be ready to get blamed for someone else’s ignorance. Don’t plan on advancing to a salaried position; you won’t.  I finally got an interview after years of trying, only to be told I wouldn’t be getting the job because I was pregnant at the time…but I can’t say anything more about that.

Easy job money and available hours. Management isn’t always present when you need them,"Cashiering was an easy job for me. Very simple and hands on. They give you enough hours, and very great with working by your schedule. You can work either 12 hours a week to 32. You could also work 4 hours shifts or 9. The environment is better than most places. Occasional rude customers depending on your work location and how busy it was. My store was small and on a high way so it wasn’t as busy like most Walmart's. Most of the coworkers were nice and friendly, Management as well. However, most weren’t present during rush hour. It honestly just depends on your store. The benefits are also another advantage. You can take personal and paid Covid leaves. You can leave anytime with PTO and majority of the days i requested off were accepted. It’s a nice SHORT TERM/ TEMPORARY job for young adults compared to others.

"3rd shift stocking. Very fast paced, time limits to get work done, very physical at times. ",Overall the pay increases for third shift made the demands of the job worth it. You have to be careful about time off (has to be requested 3 weeks in advance and approved) or missing days (sick etc) because they operate on a points system and you can lose your job if you get too many points (I think 4 or more) but if you’re a good worker and an asset to the company they will typically try to work with you. If you cause problems they will be quicker to let you go. Training is lacking but might be different in different stores. ,5,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Denver, NC",2/9/22,2022,2,9

Every year Walmart cares less and less about their associates and customers. I have worked for Walmart twice. They were a much better company to work for 25 years ago. Now its all about the money. If you have a bad manager they will put their head in the sand no matter how many people complain. If all your going to do is go in and work(stock or cashier) 8 hours and not care about anything you will do good. that is if you get a good store manager.

However, I have had some bad experiences, such as being picked on (targeted) by not only my co workers but my supervisor. Even when I was one of the best workers there and still was being targeted, but who knows maybe it was because of the way I am or just different. Most of the managers know what they are doing but some will have you question yourself like if they should be a manager at all. Some are lazy as well. The promotions are fast too.

Set your true availability right when you start. ,"It’s a great company to work for until it’s not. I would suggest to anyone applying here set your true availability right when you first start and make sure your HR/ Team Leads are aware of your schedule. Otherwise, you’ll have to wait 90 days after your start date to request a new availability. I had to leave after I explained I can’t work 4 am-1 pm due to classes interfering with my schedule. It wasn’t taken seriously as I was told I’m a great employee and I work hard but had a lack of respect for my educational goals outside of the workplace.

But the management there is completely terrible. They are very rude and don’t care about nobody but their selves. You have to put up with their attitude and their back talk towards you.Attendance is also very important there, 5 strikes and your out. If you call in on a day your scheduled thats a point. And your also required to work on holidays with absolutely no extra pay and if you call in on a holiday its 3 points.There was a lot of good times and moments I’ve had at the job though. Pay was ok but could be way better for the amount of work you have to put in there. Be prepared to be overworked unless your making $15 an hour or more.Coworkers are very nice and would love to help if you need help with anything. The leads/supervisors are decent.

Horrible. Management throws on ridiculous amounts of work and berates you for not finishing it. ,"I've worked at many companies prior to Walmart. Never have I ever worked in a place that overworks their workers to the point of breakdowns and then tell their employees the breakdown happened because they couldn't keep up with the job. They load on 10 to 15 hours of work and DEMANDS all of it be finished in 5 hours or less. Cleaning and sanitizing is an absolute joke. They demanded ECOLAB to be harsher on their monthly checks, telling deli and bakery workers that if it isn't pristine with no oil buildup (there's fryers. There's going to be oil build up) our jobs will be on the line. Management doesn't lift a finger to help.

Unclear set of duties and unsanitary work enviroment,I was hired as an apparel sales associate but it was unclear what exactly I was supposed to do. They would randomly move me to another part of the store and only give me vague instructions. Also they don't give you gloves or a knife and opening boxes for hours with your bare hands is painful. Once the meat fridge power went out and someone decided to throw all the meat away in the trash compactor and for over a week the smell of rotting meat permeated the entire back of the store.

They want you to stay completely silent while working, one word spoken and you get in trouble and have your job threatened. A whole lot of favoritism and even the team leads/managers don’t know how to run the department! You will be overworked, underpaid, and treated like you do not matter. This company only cares about making money, they have no respect or concern for their employees and are only concerned with their numbers on a computer looking good instead of focusing on the department itself.

A joke.,"They opened this warehouse way too soon. Management doesn’t know what they’re doing and HR are a bunch of clowns who have a thought process of a 3 year old. Neither management or HR can answer simple questions without saying “I don’t know” like a broken record. I got hired in November and the warehouse still looks the same….EMPTY. There’s no heat in the warehouse and the trucks we work in are extremely cold (it’s currently winter). We can’t wear hoodies or coats on the floor to keep warm. The biggest joke of all is we keep getting sent home early…EVERYDAY. Shifts are 5 hours long and we regularly get sent home after working 3 hours because they’re either trying to save work for another shift or there’s not a lot of volume for the day. I can’t even recall the last time we actually worked a full shift honestly. There was even a time weeks ago management denied us our 15 minute break. I can go on and on and on. People are starting to leave left to right, I’ve even witnessed people leave in the middle of the shift and not come back or people leaving during break never to be seen again.

There was little to no training and the small amount I did have was limited to computer exercises instead of shadowing another employee which would have actually helped.  I never knew what I was doing each day when I showed up because of the constant changing of supervisors and departments, despite my job description being only for grocery, and yet was often reprimanded for being at a loss for what to do.

Constantly going up and down ladders and lifting a lot of heavy objects upwards of 50 lbs. to the point of injuries to my feet and back were the hardest parts of the job.  I couldn't do anything once I got home each day.  Though dealing with customers who were demanding and demeaning is a close second in terms of difficulty.

Walmart was ok. The best part was the reoccurring customers,"8 hours a day, two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. The best part was the reoccurring customers, they made the job worth while. The job was extremely easy and they had computer lessons that taught you exactly how to bag items.  Sometimes the managers would try to make you do a less than 8 hour turnaround. You really have to stand up for yourself or they would walk all over you. The managers I had would shuffle you to different departments to help out and it really gave you different skills. Unfortunately they would schedule part time staff to work full time hours for 11 weeks and tremendously drop your hours on the 12th week to not make you full time status like they're suppose to.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Clarksville, TN",1/31/22,2022,1,31

I rarely see people actually held accountable for words, actions, or their tasks they're supposed to do. They often update our tools and apps making the work worse than they did before. The human resources are a joke when it comes to resolving ethical concerns. They want you to do the job as fast as you can. Not correctly. I assure you the freshest groceries are in the front because we aren't allowed the time to rotate properly.There are good people there, that care and the like. But they're far out weighed by the bad.

The location I worked for was good about approving my unpaid time off requests and they were VERY flexible with my scheduling & availability needs. The location I worked for was also good about never keeping me beyond 15 minutes after my shift ended even in times of severe cashier shortage. The customers that Wal-Mart often attracts are horrible to employees that are there to serve them.

"Workplace could be better by a lot, but at least the pay is good","The Walmart I worked at was very poor. The ratings were bad. Some of the employees there obviously weren't there to be happy—(who works at Walmart to be HAPPY?) so it's depressing. When it gets full, it's hard to navigate, especially if you're working Online Grocery Pickup and you have to drag a massive cart around. Not to mention that if a customer gets in your way, most of the time you're gonna have to sit and wait... which really messes with your ""score"" when you have to get these items to the back ASAP. Scoring system specifically for OGP is really terrible, by the way, but I won't get into that because it's a whole can of worms. If you want to work here, then there must be no other place hiring, you don't care about being happy, and you're willing to put in the hours and work for the money. But if you are a very VERY SUPER PATIENT person, go for it. (I used to consider myself as very patient. Now I don't know if I have low patience, or if working here really was miserable.) As OGP, though, scanning and gathering the items is a mindless labor and it's genuinely not bad until the Walmart gets full... or when the item isn't there and you have to search the messy storage for it... or when no one's properly stocking the shelves... or when the customers are blocking the way.......Maybe if you're an extremely lucky person, this job won't be so bad.",2,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Tampa, FL",1/30/22,2022,1,30

Fortunately,  im good at customer service and am not afraid to push buttons and try and problem solve. Basically, it was a lot of me looking like boo boo the fool and constantly apologizing to customers.... Every. Day. Management was burned out.      I quit. Best decision.

Tolerable most of the time,"As a lowly Customer Service Desk associate my job is tolerable as long as my coworkers and I get along. The job itself is pretty easy, the worst part being dealing with upset customers. Although this entirely depends on who your managers are, working here for 8+ years we have gone through MANY CSM/Front End team leads and my job can get significantly more annoying if the front end managers are bad. Also if you're looking at this thinking of being a manager at Walmart I would look at how long the other managers have been in their position. At my store right now upper management is terrible and there isn't a single front end team lead that's been in the position longer than a year when there used to be several in the position for 10+ years. They keep quitting/moving departments/stepping down. TL;DR; The job is tolerable depending on management. See how long people have been in their positions to gauge how management is.

Decent place to work,"Typically these are swing-shift positions so it's not an ideal situation for someone who needs a set schedule unless you're part-time.

"Fast-paced, disorganized, poor morale, little to no team work.","I worked at the same store for about 2 and half years in the digital fulfillment department as a full-time associate. Perhaps it's different at each location, but miscommunication, poor planning, and extremely low morale were all very apparent issues throughout the entire time I was there. The hard workers were treated worse, as they were expected to constantly do more work than the rest, while other workers were allowed to slack off, wander, take extended/extra breaks, etc. if they were favored by managers. Favoritism was another big issue, but it never bothered me until it got to the point I was getting in trouble for not picking up other people's slack. The backroom was often in shambles, and being friends with a lot of associates from all departments, nobody felt valued or motivated to do more than the bare minimum, because again, hard workers were treated worse. Associates were also misled into thinking they could have secure and consistent schedules by filling out an availability sheet, but the managers would still make them work days or hours they clearly stated verbally and on the sheet that they were not available for work. Drama was a very big issue even in management, which often made workplace issues be brought up and/or tackled in very unprofessional ways. Workplace drama is inevitable, but it often was taken too far at this store.Overall, the issues the store had from the moment I started to the moment I left (within a 2 and a half year period) either remained the same or got worse.

There's no communication so no higher ups ever know what's going on, they don't train you when you start and if you don't do or finish with the task that was given to you, you'll get fired.... even if you've worked their for years on end.

I've been a manager of several jobs before this and I've had to make the ""managers"" here at this company back down from trying to micromanage. Seems like a waste of time.

"Overnight stocking at Walmart is fun but, I was switched to a maintenance job that I didn't like with improper equipment and assistance.","I loved being an overnight stocker at Walmart until I was put in a refrigerated cleaning position. They were very unorganized about this position and had never had a person consistently take care of the refrigerated cases. I worked alone with cleaning supplies I scavenged from the store because the current cleaning equipment was broken. They told me for months that they would get me the new equipment to then find out that they had forgot to order it. They had neglected hiring someone to clean the cases for who knows how long until their store manager started to notice and got real mad. I was the one person they picked out of the whole night crew because I was ""too slow"" and didn't meet their fifty boxes an hour quota. I was one of the few people who didn't just plug items on a shelf and actually cared about my area being clean and organized. Due to me caring about my area and the store, I was then thrown to a position that it ten times harder with no pay increase or benefits. When I asked for assistance, because one guy cleaning all the refrigerated cases in a Walmart Super-Center is ridiculous, they laughed at me. I was distraught at the fact that I had a job I loved with co-workers that I quickly became friends with, to then be working a job I hated with nobody around me to help. My co-workers even wondered why they did this to me. I wouldn't have hated it so much if I had gotten a small pay increase, because of the difficulty of the job. I had to clean massive amounts of mold, chicken juice, broken glass, and some of the most foul stuff out of these cases due to them being - more...",4,Former Employee,Overnight Team Associate ,"Mobile, AL",1/24/22,2022,1,24

If you’re not use to working night shift, it’s going to be hard at first and you sometimes might feel like breaking down because your body is trying to get use to the schedule change plus the amount of work you do, but once you adjust it gets easier. 3 times a week out of the 5 days you work, upper management is going to give you unrealistic goals for you to get your work done. I use to get upset and worry about if I’m going to get it done but plsssss don’t get upset and feel like you have to do it all, we are all people at the end of the day and we can only do so much. Just try your best and do what you can. I’ve had moments thinking that they’re going to fire me but I know that they know we can’t do it all. I guess Im one of the lucky ones to have good management because they were always supportive to me and others. Just don’t get on anyones bad side and work life will be easy.  If you do consider working here it’s not bad it’s just a lot of work but don’t let that scare you away. My final words is STICK TO YOUR SLEEP SCHEDULE!

I once had to show the store manager how to ring someone up. The pay is good for what you do and it’s a pretty inclusive environment, but my experience is that the worst people always somehow end up as managers.

Chances for advancement but can be extremely stressful at times. ,"Not very supportive management and definitely favoritism was prominent at my store. Big changes can happen very fast with little to no support from management so be prepared to have customers upset and sometimes irate over things you aren’t responsible for. It can be very easy to move up or be promoted but because of that some employees become managers that should most likely not have control over an entire team. I would say to be mindful, careful, a team player, and a hard worker to create less stress for yourself in the long run. Large companies that don’t pay enough and have a stressful environment can cause tension in the work place so just keep a level head and remember that work drama doesn’t need to follow you home or make work difficult!

Management let the kids get away with pretty much anything. Management was just poor in general. Played favorites and would take their personal problems out on people. Doesn't matter how hard you work because they won't notice. They'll only notice when you do something wrong, but they only come down on the people that don't kiss their butts.

Decent workplace but felt like high school.,"I worked here January 2020 to July 2021 and first I can say it is a decent work place but can often feel just like high school. It also never felt like management truly cared about you or your growth. At the end of my Walmart journey  I was fired for ""not communicating"" with my new store after a transfer although I did. When applying for UI after the fact my store had lied and told them I quit which resulted in me never receiving any financial help after being being wrongfully fired and also recently forced out of my apartment as well. Aside from all of that, the hours were pretty consistent and the pay was okay for what you do. Most days were pretty stressful, if you don't have a very good department/team lead that can manage time and staff well it can really offset your entire job and your days. A lot of drama as well but when ignored it is and can be a pretty decent job.

Your experience depends on the people around you.,"I got hired on the spot when I went in for my interview. Once I started working, it was decent. Stocking shelves is super easy, and can get even be enjoyable if you like organizing and/or sorting things. The problems lie within the people around you and above you. The team I joined when I first started working was friendly and close because of our manager, who was excellent at his job and was a great advocate and leader for the team. Months afterwards, management changed, people were moved around to other positions, many of my colleagues quit, and suddenly I dreaded coming to work. If you work here, do not get comfortable, things change very quickly. As well, you will be pushed to your limits with work. Everything needs to be done quickly, yet also with a level of detail that requires you to take your time. Work environment is generally decent, besides the constant workplace drama.

Also, on your first day they throw you out on the floor without telling you anything, or teaching you anything and just expect you to do it all on yourself.

Unattainable production goals will leave you worn down physically and mentally. ,"The pay is good, but the company's way of measuring production is completely unreachable. Management needs to re-evaluate the standards set for order fillers. Often times you are sent home early because you and your team have completed the days work hours ahead of time, yet you'll then come in the next day to a write up that states you didn't meet your goals, and could be subject to disciplinary action as a result. Safety is laughably bad. Pallets of 40 lb. cases stacked 9 feet high.. glass products stacked overhead and out of reach so the only acceptable way to pick them is to use a ""pull-hook"" and pull the heavy glass items towards you.. If they were more realistic about their production standards it wouldn't be a bad job, but it's almost impossible to stay motivated when you work as hard as you can, finish your work on time or ahead of schedule, yet constantly get told it's not good enough and that you're insufficient.",1,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Raymond, NH",1/18/22,2022,1,18

Unrealistic Expectations ,"Overall it was a decent place to work.  The problems occur when we were short staffed due to Covid and expected to do the job of an entire team with very few employees.

Not the worst place to work. But management controls how good of a job it is,With a good manager it’s a great place to work. But unfortunately almost no Walmarts have good managers. They only have managers who don’t want to manage and let you suffer for them not doing their job.

Overall good place to work and is becoming much more competitive and flexible,"Typical expected 9 hours per day (7:30-5:30) at corporate office, but most departments are flexible and allow work life balance (at the senior management levels). The culture & values are very strong throughout the company. There is endless possibilities of different job areas and opportunities to grow your career. Benefits and pay (base pay + bonus + stock options) is competitive. There can be too much politics at upper level management which can hinder progress. There is also issues with getting technical resources needed to do work effectively. Treatment of people seems to mostly be fair, but it can depend on your managers.

They completely disregard your availability and favoritism is very evident at my store at least. This was my first job so if you’re a teen then yes work at Walmart, you develop many skills and friends. If you’re worried about getting enough hours they will supply you with more than enough and you may even be overworked. It’s hard mentally but you get used to it and adjust.

Also, they didn’t even train me properly; I was trained for 10 minutes then put on the register afterwards, my coworkers had to teach me how to work the register.

Trying too many new things at once,In the 2 years or so the company has made too many changes and management hasn't figured out how to adjust to them. One example is the doing away with dept. managers and replacing them with team leads that cover a much larger area and don't have time to do everything that needs to be done. This change also makes it harder to move up because there are less positions to move into.  ,3,Current Employee,Retail Associate ,"Enterprise, AL",1/17/22,2022,1,17

Very stressful and Toxic,"The Team leads and Coaches are brutal with how they treat associates, often expecting way too much of them, especially 2nd shift, who isn't supposed to be assigned that much compared to the others. Apparel is by far the MOST toxic out of all the departments there, with the team lead always complaining about something even through she's the problem since she's always confusing people by wanting them in several places at once and is always seen sitting around talking to others.

Job depends on several variables:,"Your enjoyment largely depends on what store you work at. It may be worth driving farther to a better store, for example. Make sure your managers aren't lazy. There's being relaxed, and then there's working hard for some D to get the glory. Work to the level your direct managers do. Otherwise health benefits are standard. The lack of meaningful employee discount is irritating. I worked for Kroger as a kid and they had a blanket %10 discount on everything.

Your coworkers are really what make you enjoy your time there. Management is wishy washy. ,"Make sure you set your availability, or they will set it to how they like. They will not make you full time employee, but they will give you the hours of a full time employee but not the benefits. I mainly worked in online pickup, if you cannot deal with the rush and how much responsibility they put on you, I suggest going to a different department. Management sucked in ogp. If you're part time and work overtime hours (anything past 40) they make you go home early how ever long you worked over, they don't care if it leaves two people in the department or one. They will pull someone off the floor that barely even knows what to do. Also sick leave isn't always paid, and if it is they don't match the hours you usually work.

"Up to and including the CEO of the company, you're expendable and replaceable and they let you know it at every opportunity.","Management is bad, but that's to be expected when they're paid less than some of their hourly associates and aren't properly trained or motivated to learn.  You're expected to sacrifice for a company that doesn't see you as anything more than numbers on a piece of paper.  Even if you do sacrifice everything for the company, a higher ranking manager may come along and set you up for failure so they can give your job to their friend.  Speed is pushed over safety or the health of everyone, customers included.  You're mentally and emotionally abused daily and the job pace is exhausting.

The only training I got besides reading on Computer Based Learning is essentially less than 2 hours of shadowing an employee. After that it was simply learning the register and trying to ask as many questions as I could. Which did seem to inconvenience people. I learned how to fill medications which is fun in its own way. There are definitely some people at the pharmacy I work at that have a chip on their shoulder of some kind. And since I’m still new and very under trained I often get hit with initial accusations on a mistake of some kind or I get chewed out for not understanding a process even though I wasn’t trained on that procedure and all the lingo based around it.

I work an hour of overtime & it’s barely 20 dollars added to my check, but if I call out a day because my daughter is unexpectedly sick it’s 80+ dollars off.

Big retail in the game for THEMSELVES. you are just a #,Been with the company 20 years and it has served its purpose of having a job with good benefits & insurance plans.  However the culture has degraded Down to NOTHING in the past 20 years.  They have taken away all bonuses & incentives for good workers.  We are under staffed and over worked 24/7. They require tasks ABOVE your pay grade with no compensation. They do not value experience or knowledge and do not compensate vet employees accordingly.

Poor Management,"I worked in a couple different departments and the jobs are easy to pick up. However, there were often times when I would be assigned to work a certain station without being trained on it and was told that I would figure it out. Management preaches that they are there for you if you have any concerns, however they will try their hardest to find excuses to downplay or dismiss your concerns to avoid addressing it. We would be down by half of our crew on a busy day, but management will refuse to help us out. Team Leads will scold associates for ""standing around"" but will pull their friends aside for 20 minutes to talk about their hang out plans after work. Management will also side with rude customers and berate you for doing your job properly.

Which is completely against company policy. Don’t try to report them, you’ll create tension and be retaliated against. Which is also against company policy.

Absolutely horrible. Mainly due to management.,"The coaches and team leads at Walmart face no consequences for blatantly and outright mistreating associates. Coaches pick favorites and absolutely treat them as such, then take out all their frustration on other associates. They face no repercussions for their actions and are allowed to essentially do as they please. It makes working there long term absolutely untenable. At most, coaches are moved to another shift. Open door discussions are utilized to try and embarrass them into treating associates better, but normally this makes things worse.

Very different workplace for every location,"It really depends on what location you work at if you’re going to enjoy the work. I work in the online pickup department and for a while, our management was perfect and I loved my job. However after a change in management things have taken a turn for the worse. It also depends on who your market team is, and how your store manager treats your department. Overall it can be a fun and relaxed place to work, and work/life balance is good as they won’t schedule you over 40 hours a week.

Out on the floor the stock you were expected to put out had no where to go...not even on the top where overflow goes.

"Productive, coworkers are the best part of the job.","You can definitely go up to management/store manager, but they tend to favoritise employees over others. As a whole management treats their employees like they're elementary kids for attendance & they do not accept doctors excuses if you are sick. The worst part is for me, they try to expect you to be doing more than one thing at a time, such as work a different job than what you're supposed to do & they just pay you for what you're supposed to do in the first place.",2,Current Employee,Cashier/Maintenance/Cart Associate ,Pennsylvania,1/1/22,2022,1,1

"Fun learning experience, terrible management",I worked at Walmart as a cake decorator and I honestly loved my team. I learned so much from my co workers and in turn got to show others what I had leaned but our store manager made us all feel like we were nothing but numbers. He told us we were incompetent and replaceable when we asked a simple question. ,3,Current Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Joplin, MO",1/1/22,2022,1,1
Management needs to get it together. ,"The only good thing about this place is the friends I made. Pay is decent only if you work over night, and it’s only decent because of Covid. The work culture is entirely too toxic. Who would have thought that Walmart has middle school-type drama each day. Management gives unrealistic expectations that can’t realistically be met and get upset when it’s not done. For example, put one person in the frozen department over night with 12 hours of freight and act surprised when it’s not done at 7am when preparing the leave.

Eh,"Don’t waste your time with this company. Worked for them twice for a good amount of time each time and the experience was the same, but worse the second time around. They switched all of their scheduling options and don’t give you hours even if you don’t have availability for only 1 day or even hour out of the week. Put people that were working there for decades out of jobs because of their “Customer First” scheduling ",1,Former Employee,Cake Decorator  ,Colorado,1/1/22,2022,1,1
Just go work for Target,"Most of Management is lazy and counter-productive, you WILL work 3 different people's job's for less than one is worth.

Some coworkers wanted to be management and boss everybody around but that was handled eventually. ,3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Cape Girardeau, MO",1/1/22,2022,1,1
Disorganized and chaotic,"You will be treated as a drop in the bucket, everyone calls out often and that becomes the other associate's problem, the manager's don't try to fix clear issues but find ways around them.

Declining work experience ,"There was a time that I loved working in Electronics. But now scheduling sucks. Favoritism at its finest. And pay is just not fair. We recently did get boosted to 13 but they give Online Grocery, Unloaders, and overnighter a pay raise. The amount of times they make sales floor associates help out other areas the pay sucks. The departments they raised hardly ever get asked to help out other areas. And I've tried for years for an earlier schedule and I got promised to have earlier shifts then got screwed.",1,Current Employee,Electronics Team Associate ,"Granbury, TX",1/1/22,2022,1,1
They need some tips.,"So I’ve been working there for a month now and it’s a alright job. I never got a formal interview explaining my job. So I basically got hired off two questions and my application. I say that they could encourage us employees better, and not have the higher management acting like they’ve never been new or have never been asked a question. I feel that all jobs should have a routine and this job really needs one. My managers are nice, but again a nice routine would make the employees not have to chase the managers asking what to do next.",1,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Palmyra, ME",12/31/21,2021,12,31

Terrible company to work for,Don't work here. They over work you and underpay you. You are not valued nor treated with respect. Also work here is very stressful. If you get hurt or sick expect extreme stress with this company. The managers are not helpful or supportive. You are on your own working here. ,1,Former Employee,Bakery Clerk ,"Meridian, ID",12/31/21,2021,12,31
"Terrible management, people are rude and very judgmental about you.",Management never helps they sit in their office and text all day and only become managers when their boss comes around. It seems like you are completely useless to them unless you are doing 150%. The pay is decent but it doesn’t help when you get sent to other areas that aren’t your own all the time for no pay increase. If you leave using your paid time off the managers get irritated and have to know why. Whether it’s because you don’t feel well or if you have an appointment or whatever. They don’t care about you or anything going on in your life even with their “door open policy”. If you try and talk to them about anything they never fix your rate even if they are the ones who asked you to talk to them. Then they get made you didn’t hit over a 100%. This place is a joke. When you aren’t there all you can think about is that you have to go back and it’s not worth it. ,2,Current Employee,Team Member ,"Gas City, IN",12/31/21,2021,12,31

Do not work here for your first job,"I am 17 years old and have worked for this company for almost a year. I wouldn't recommend. You get occurrences, points, for everything even if you were told you wouldn't. They don't follow availability at all and will give you occurrences if you don't show up, despite the shift being against your availability. The only benefit is the people. You can make great friends there. The team leads and coworkers are actually pretty great if you can get along with them. The coaches on the other had are the worst. They will pull you out of your section to do other jobs and then reprimand you for not completing your assigned job in your original department. I wouldn't recommend this job especially if this is one of your first jobs. It is too stressful and contradictory. Management can't make up their minds and you are the only one who gets blamed for the work not being done. ",2,Current Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Chandler, AZ",12/31/21,2021,12,31
Good place to work. The benefits and pay are competitive.  Your manager will define how good or bad your work experience is.,"The company is a great place to work at store level. The tasking seems to be fair and depending on if you have good managment in your building work can be downright fun. The company can get demanding ay times as callouts and lack of wages will be a substantial burden on people that actually come to work. Still, it's the best paying job by far in the retail scene and there are plenty of opportunities for advancement. I started as an overnight stocker and became a salaried manager through Walmart.

The only good thing about this job is the pay! Unless this is your last resort I would say look for something better.,"Management is horrible, rarely anyone knows what is going on for real. If you have any issues you're going to be sent on a wild goose chase before it's resolved. You're only allowed 2 breaks ( 20min and 25min) during the 11 hour shift so I would advise that you wear comfortable shoes. The refrigerators in the break room smell like moldy food and there isn't much that the custodians try to do about it. The job is overall very much the same everyday so if you don't like changes then it might be a good fit for you. Majority of the people that I've spoken to about the job say that they are just there for the of the money. the current pay is $20+ an hour depending on the shift that you work, but I heard that they are lowering it to $17 after New Years for all shifts and at that point it isn't worth it.",2,Former Employee,Picker ,5300 Westport Pkwy,12/31/21,2021,12,31

Usually pretty friendly coworkers but poor management ,The coworkers were usually more friendly and helpful but finding a manager was nearly impossible and the management was unfriendly and rude. Had a team lead try to fight me because he thought I was telling him he was wrong. Management did nothing about it and his behavior kept up. Management was poor and the managers seemed to not have much experience and expected extreme amounts of work out of people.

Productive and fun place to work everyone is all in their own bubble no drama ,"It’s a really chill laid back place to work at. It’s not bad as people say it is. The only thing I’ll say that is bad is management along with coaches don’t tell you about occurrences and end up firing associates that didn’t even know what occurrences are. An important thing to know is that if your schedule is changed without giving you a 24 hour notice before hand say no. For example: if you’re scheduled Friday at 2pm-11pm and Saturday the same time but management changes Saturdays time to either 7am-4pm, 8am-5pm, 10am-7pm, 11am-8pm after 2pm on Friday then you tell them you cannot as there was no 24 hour notice.

"Too few people, too much to do.","My workload was fine if I was left in my department but I was often tossed between multiple and would never know what to dress for.

This combined with the fact that during the month I worked there my Lead (if that's the correct term) never said more than two words to me. When she finally did address me she did so in a very unprofessional and degrading way.

High stress work environment ,"Usual pharmacy work such as filling prescriptions and dealing with insurance while someone angrily stares at you asking you what’s taking so long. The required counseling also makes things difficult as many people are angered over it or the lines get longer as you are speaking to people. I would say the work environment also depends on what store you are at and the difficulty of customers along with the competency of your coworkers. As a pharmacist, you are required to travel to other stores as a staff pharmacist and at times they will schedule up to a 5 hr drive outside of your home store with only a low gas reimbursement. Also scheduling can be horrendous since they use a template but will still schedule on your off days with only a 2 week notice, so scheduling doctors appointments or vacation is extraordinarily difficult. Short notice scheduling sometimes only 2 weeks out even though you are required to alert the schedulers of your days requested off 3 months in advance which they can ignore, And if scheduled on the day you requested off 3 months ago you are responsible for finding coverage which is difficult. Adding to this, sick days are rarely allowed since you’ll have to find coverage yourself which almost never works out. Also, you are only allowed a 30 min lunch with no breaks even on a 12hr shift considering there’s usually only one, sometimes 2, pharmacists working on a shift.

They rarely ever help out or tale on tasks of their own because they're too busy walking the aisles looking for someone taking 5 seconds to take a drink of water or wipe the sweat from their brow so they can belittle them and make them feel inferior to the mighty Walmart hourly manager.

I've only ever had 1 review and I had to beg them for it for months (you're supposed to get one every year). Salaried management has approached me about taking a management job, which would come with a raise, but I would not be able to work the hours that I do currently, which cannot change due to a full time college schedule.
