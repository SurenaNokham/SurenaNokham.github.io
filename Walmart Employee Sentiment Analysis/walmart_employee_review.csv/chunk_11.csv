You will receive bonuses 3 times per year which pay out hundreds of dollars.",4,Current Employee,Electronics associate ,"Terre Haute, IN",1/9/20,2020,1,9
do as i say not as i do,basically you are told one thing and to do another. wal mart as a whole has a good plan. there is no back up plan. so when something doesnt go as planned everyone points fingers. the job motto is rob peter to pay paul. only peter never gets attended to so that department gets undermined and you spend more time trying to fix rather than maintain. a lot has to do with who is running the show. so if you have bad leadership it just gets passed on down and its never rectified. In my experience bad behavior and work practices are rarely ever addressed. A person who does not produce as much as the other person in the same department seems to never have to answer for it. wal mart has good people working their but most are in the wrong position.,3,Former Employee,Service Manager ,"Alpharetta, GA",1/9/20,2020,1,9
It is good,The work environment  varies depending on location. Manger and team lead make sure that everything goes smoothly so that both costumers and members have a clean fast and friendly service.

Increasing entry level pay that just stays ahead of minimum wage,"A company relentlessly focused on cost cutting have produced management having little power and even less discretion. They can only follow orders from the head office and try to meet ever demanding goals with ever fewer staff. Management or employee development for the record, are paid lip service with the time invested in management training less than half of what it used to be. And as for the associates, only department managers get any training. _x000D__x000D_As for our customers, they can only complain that the checkout lines get longer as the cashiers get fewer. And you can't get help when you need it.",3,Current Employee,Long term Full-time Associate ,"Norwalk, CT",1/9/20,2020,1,9
Poor training and management,"I was so excited about getting the job at Walmart in Mt sterling ky as a personal shopper.

Productive and standard workplace,"I handled multiple duties such as handling cash,customer returns,answering questions about merchandise,pricing,product location,etc. I learned how to develop a thick skin as there are many different types of personalities you will come across on a day to day basis that may tempt you to respond unprofessionally at times and can be extremely difficult to deal with. The management was standard like most minimum wage jobs and anyone looking to work here should expect to have an extremely difficult time getting days off for everyday emergencies and or holidays as it will be held against you to the highest degree and lead you that much closer to possibly being terminated despite your performance. The workplace is pretty standard when your not checking someone through you will be asked to do miscellaneous task around the front area of the store. The hardest part of the job would have to be a lot of the awkward interactions with customers that would come in regularly and the occurrence system it took little to nothing to quickly rack up a few occurrences and before you know it your gone. The best part of the job was meeting nice down to earth people and the scheduling wasn't all that bad.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Kernersville, NC",1/9/20,2020,1,9
Meh,The starting pay and quick raises are nice. However that’s about the only good thing. I didn’t get the shift I wanted and probably won’t be able to switch for over a year. The managers don’t really put forth much of an effort to train or explain anything. And there is no holiday pay or sick pay. Also the production percentage they require grows monthly. It’s very overwhelming and underwhelming,3,Current Employee,Forklift Operator ,"Loveland, CO",1/9/20,2020,1,9

It’s a place that gives you a paycheck.,"I’ve never felt appreciated at work. Not necessarily because i need it to preform well just different from other employers.

Not the manager though, oddly enough. Regardless, the store eventually cleaned itself up more from the looks of it, management in electronics was extremely kind when I worked there, but literally every other department I saw would try to make people work overtime clocked out, or not take lunch until an hour before they leave, human ethics had to be frequently called before I eventually quit after being threatened by a manager.

"Dull job, but it needs to be done","I would come in, and shortly after we would unload the truck, once this was done we would stock the shelves. This job would've been better if the building was more organized, or if they ever closed, so that we could fix things. Morale tended to stay low within stock crew, and the lower it got the longer it took to do things. I found myself trying way too hard to help out coworkers who kept telling me to just focus on my station, even when that would've meant standing around, and doing nothing. When I finally stopped helping them their stuff was all that was left on the line, while everyone else was done, and ready to stock the shelves._x000D__x000D_ Early on I heard of some bigotry within some of the workforce, which until they left for an unrelated reason, left me uncomfortable. Even then, I wasn't comfortable here. _x000D__x000D_The job was fine, just boring. The coworkers that were an issue, and that were dramatic were the problem. Some upper management was obviously inexperienced in regards to the experience of us 'little guys', but it wasn't too hard a job outside of the drama, and the things I would've liked to move up to fix. General morale within older employees was low as well, due to their minimum pay not being raised fairly with their new minimum pay when it became $11 an hour.",3,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Weaverville, NC",1/6/20,2020,1,6

It has opportunity.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Palmdale, CA",1/6/20,2020,1,6
Great place,I started working Walmart with a fresh baby and was a full time student and was able to balance it. They encourage you to go to school so they will work with you.

Slave labor is alive and well in America,"This company is horribly mismanaged! The best way to get ahead is to suck up to an Asst Manager,  or Dept Manager.  I worked in Lawn & Garden, which also handled Seasonal.  There's never enough employees, the equipment is old or broken, not enough rotation of duties within the department. I had to beg for training and still didn't receive it! Frequently I was left on my own running the cash register.  There would be over 20 customers in my line with no help to be had. This company seems to enjoy making their employees miserable. Worst job I ever had!",2,Former Employee,Lawn and Garden Associate ,"Palmdale, CA",1/6/20,2020,1,6
Good place to work,"Nice clean environment, but they do not offer overtime at all and they have a point system which causes a lot of people to get fired quickly, which is why night shift is very shorthanded",3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Dyersburg, TN",1/6/20,2020,1,6
production and inprovments,they don't really care about the people that work there they just want to hire as many people as they can for whatever season they need then fire you. I got hired on but didn't feel like I was treated fairly. there was a lot of favoritism. and I just felt like another number on the charts. production would keep getting higher and was eventually hard to meet. towards the beginning of my hiring they were working on getting many more things for the break room where associates could be more relaxed but they would cut out breaks in half. there was hardly any time to do any of those activities due to the enforcement of a 10 min break and that you walking to the the break room was part of the break which I did not agree with.,4,Former Employee,stocker/receiver ,"Chino, CA",1/6/20,2020,1,6
Deli Associate,"My time here was awful, I worked at the Naperville, IL location off Route 59. The store manager was awful, he refused to okay orders until things were done his way. WHICH left the store severely under stocked or overstocked in products not used. I worked in the Deli department and that was terrible because there was so much inconsistency and no one ever knew what to do. The store manager did not listen to us who actually work the counter but instead pushed his agenda with threats and bullying. Our department managers were awful as well, ridiculing employees and too often not assisting us with orders and serving food. On top of that when we would overhead for other managers to come help no one would come until 20+min later but by then we didn't need their help. I had to go on early maternity leave due to be forced to lift heavy boxes (mind you these are filled with meat), stock freezers, wash equipment for cooking, changing the oil in the fryers and pushing heavy loads to my area to restock. Walmart does not care about their employees but cares about money. You as an employee are expendable, your handwork does not matter and your ideas to better your department are ridiculous.",1,Former Employee,DELI ASSOCIATE ,"Naperville, IL",1/6/20,2020,1,6

Kearny Store sucks,"The co-managers are immature and petty in this store. The Assistant store managers all care about getting their OWN objectives taken care of regardless if it messes someone else's objective up. both co-managers and ASMs back each other up in coachings so even if you open door policy the coaching, its useless. one comanager is a big bully and likes to fire people for no reason. if you work in Cap team 2 here, good luck trying to get any type of promotion or get your department change request approved in a timely manner. i know corporate doesnt care as long as the store makes money, but this lack of communication with the upper level management is really an issue here that will lead to an eventual downfall of this store. too many people who see how bad the conditions are for cap 2 end up wanting to go to another department before they are even fully hired, so that leaves cap 2 being understaffed for so long and management still expects them to get through 3 trucks daily in one shift.",3,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Kearny, NJ",1/6/20,2020,1,6

Overall liked working at Walmart,Overall I did like working at Walmart.  My main concern was pay. Although 11 an hour to start is good for the job.

I left right before the yearly raise came but did hear it was .29 per hour.,4,Former Employee,Cap Team 1 Associate ,"Smithfield, NC",1/5/20,2020,1,5
Bottom dollar,Lets see i started with the promise of working 34 to 40 hours which is full time. Im lucky to get 30 hours a week while in all departmens are facing the same issue. They hire people and then cut hours of already established employees and give the hours to the new hires. They add on work from what you was hired to do all the time when your job is still yet to be completed. Theres no integrity shown from managment you bring up a problem its walked off untill you get written up.,3,Current Employee,Other ,"Marion, IN",1/5/20,2020,1,5
Up and Down,For the area that I live in Walmart is the top paying company. They do have good benefits. I enjoyed the people I work with but some I did not. I hate being talked down to by management and corporate thinking they are higher then the rest and that nothing can happen to them. I do not take the I know everything and you no nothing from managers. It is a great place to work when you have a good crew to work with but when you have lazy ones and you call them out on it and management just push it aside like you are just being to harsh is when you have issues. I prefer evenings because everyone works well together. Also when another Customer Service Manager comes along you get pushed aside and thrown into all different shifts while they get consistent ones.,3,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Polson, MT",1/5/20,2020,1,5

The different personalities are super intriguing and interesting.,"Walmart is run by a point system for attendance. Which they are very strict about, a .5 is when you are anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours late and a full point is given when you miss a day but they have PTO to cover if you work enough hours. There are also days where the points get doubled, special days. Then if you clear the doubled point you only get half of it covered. That is literally my ONLY complaint, I loved working there. I worked at the service desk and my favorite thing about Walmart was how quickly I moved up in the company and seeing all the different personalities come in and out of the store.",5,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate ,"North Dartmouth, MA 02747",1/5/20,2020,1,5

Great for money but the management isn't great,During my experience working at Walmart I provided great customer service to the people that came in however management was all over the place.

Shipping Dept is tough but it is what it is,The shipping dept. seems to be best suited for people above 5 ft. 5in.. closer to 6ft would be ideal. Must be in shape or willing to get fit. Heavy lifting. Periods of high physical activity. Some managers truely care and are understanding but Wal-Mart has strict policies and they can be a bit ridiculouis.

Becoming too apathetic.,"Walmart has been getting a horrible reputation for not really communicating with their workers. They need to reach out more, and understand their employees needs. I understand from a business perspective, but work should make you feel comfortable, and have a sense of fulfillment and purpose. Only being allowed to miss three days of work before threatening termination is really awful, thing's come up in anyone's lives. I'm not saying that a person should be allowed to stay home whenever they want, its their job, but Walmart should definitely talk with their employees and see if they have a serious issue going on. I think it would help reduce tensions with Walmart and the general public._x000D_My work was fun, and definitely a challenge for myself. However, It seems like Walmart acts like it's a ""family"" type business, but doesn't really commit to that sort of ideology. The amount of coworkers I had talked to who felt like they were being tied down by their jobs, their family relationships being torn apart, all of it, was really sad. Too many people doing too many different jobs. The scheduling was incredibly difficult to work with, although I liked my hours, there were too many people being scheduled at once. There was a lot of tension in that workplace setting, but overall, I still loved my job for the exercise and fresh air, the pay, and the coworkers who actually put in the effort to do what they could to make it enjoyable. It's a very common opinion to hear that Walmart has just become too big, and has lost it's personal touch.",3,Former Employee,Cart Associate ,"Bemidji, MN",1/4/20,2020,1,4

Management & Pay,"My time working at walmart for a decent stretch of time was enough to collect information on how poor the management was but the pay was good.

Written and unwritten rules,The culture and ideas that are behind Walmart and its distribution center are phenomenal the sad reality is very rarely are these ideas and cultures followed. You will always be told how you are breaking or not following cultures and ideas but the moment it becomes a rush or an emergency which is led by case per man hours you will be told to get it done no matter what but if caught you will be fired. They will tell you safety is number one until case per man ours is in Jeopardy. If you get hurt and you don’t tell anybody chances are you will be able to keep your job. The sad fact is if you are hurt and you tell them it will be your fault they will point out how you failed to perform your job properly. Mind your words for if you are perceived as saying or doing anything that someone else could miss construed your actions or words you will be fired. Most common phrase is “at this DC it is ok!” But it will contrary there very own safety and culture ideas. You know something is off at this distribution center due to the fact that most of its upper management with 10+ years has either left to other DC’s or quit. Sad fact is some good ones got fired long before they could change or quit.,2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Mankato, MN",1/4/20,2020,1,4

awful employee policies,my honest review at this point of Walmart . well its not an awful place to work if you don't plan on life happening at all outside of work if you plan to never be sick have car or medical issues or to ever take time off because your children or spouse are sick this company has a sick policy of no more than 5 days in a 6 month period and they will not let you qualify for any kind of medical leave till you have been with the company for at least a year so when someone like me (who has multiple sclerosis) goes in blindly i end up losing my job for essentially having a medical condition but with no grounds to do anything legally because of the stupid policy they have you sign off on in orientation i'm pretty sure that protects them in some way but its absolutely ridiculous because other than that attendance issue i was basically the perfect employee stayed late came in on days off cam in early swapped shifts was never short on my drawer did all the things so ill leave it up to you to decide _x000D__x000D_good luck,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Presque Isle, ME",1/3/20,2020,1,3

Overall it was a relatively pleasant environment made significantly worse by poor company ideas.,Walmart being such a large chain of stores with such a vast number of employees was unable to provide meaningful rewards to hard working associates. Pay and benefits were basically the same for everyone regardless of skill or productivity. Even the quarterly bonuses they tried to insentivise didn't really matter since they were uniform across each store. So someone who barely works at all gets the same as someone working their hardest every day. The only means of hard work insentive Walmart provides is potential advancement opportunities but not everyone wants promotion and even if they do there are not nearly enough opportunities for all associates who work hard. The corporate side of the company is also completely out of touch with the work done on the stores as the were constantly making changes that stagnated or even devoloved our productivity.,2,Former Employee,Cap 2 Receiving Supervisor ,"Edwardsville, IL",1/2/20,2020,1,2

You know what you need to do Walmart,"You know what you need to do Walmart for 1 you need to pay more money enough money to actually get what you need done done, there's too many cutting corners such as cross training, it's meant for coverage of areas when somebody won't be there for a of timebut as most often used to train people and multiple areas so you won't have to hire extra people.",3,Former Employee,Electronics associate ,"Rosedale, MD",1/2/20,2020,1,2

I've learned how to multi task and wear multiple jackets and help the people to their needs.  also as a member of management I've learned to build a strong team in the workplace to assist me when it comes to teaching and training, also listen to the people getting their feedback so the workload gets done in a timely manner.  the hardest part for me at work would have to be perhaps new changes that i'm not familiar with. everyday is an enjoyable moment at Walmart to me when i see the many smiles on the customer's faces.",5,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1/2/20,2020,1,2
Evil company,Literally treated like a cog in a machine that can be thrown out at any time. Almost felt like my ideas or even my health mattered for that matter to management. speaking of management... It's literally a joke. You wonder why so many speak so ill of this place when you have managers that literally laugh in your face when you have an issue. Or threaten to walk you out the door because you were not completing tasks up to their immediate standards (Although under staffed). Complete joke of a job and i'd rather make minimum wage for the rest of my life than go back here.,2,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Maysville, KY",1/2/20,2020,1,2

Some hard workers but the team concept it not pushed,Workplace Culture_x000D_As a whole Walmart idea is great team is the driving force. Depending on the location you work at will determine how much management really pushes teamwork.

Oh, and no raise. If you prove to be a hard worker, they will stack more work on you and treat you like a robot. Meanwhile, those employees who are ""personal"" with their supervisor will be able to aux into alternative codes which means they won't have to take as many calls. There was a girl on my team who worked on her resume while we were taking a bunch of calls but, of course, the AOM was on her side. If you have a college degree, do not think about starting here because it has no value to anyone. All they care about is how many calls you can take per day.

Best as a short term employment,"Walmart has a lot of problems with managers and employee work ethic. The culture that surrounds Walmart creates a cycle of people not thinking highly of it so they bring minimal effort which then makes it crappier to work there and thus persists the fact that it really does suck to work there.

Productive work place with some good benefits,"Walmart has a lot of innovative ideas, and support for college. They have a few benefits, like discount card for products. The discount card can also be used for Walmart's vision centers as well as a few others. They also offer free medical check ups such as high blood pressure or free cholesterol check ups sometimes. The management varies on the store. Walmart pays more than most companies but they do make you do more than what's in your job title. They will have you working in any department if they need you enough. Personally, like in electronics they may have you doing wireless, or photo or freight and returns all in the same day. On top of customer service, sales, and cash handling. Walmart pays well, but they do have you multi-tasking a lot. Walmart offers a lot of great opportunities but the hardest part is having to multi-task six things at once.

You learn to love your coworkers.,Over the course of two years I had gone threw 12 managers.

Managers took credit for the work of other associates. They would tell you if you changed your schedule they couldn’t give you any hours but always complained of being short staffed.

"High work expectations for little to no reward or pay-off. Benefits decrease every year, as does time off availability.","When I first started at the facility, I recommended working there to all my friends and family. Almost 5 years later, however, I would not make the same recommendation. Benefits have continually decreased and some even taken away over the past few years. For a multi-billion dollar company, insurance is poor and there are a lot of hoops to jump through if you have to take extended time off due to injury or family issues. You do not have any holidays off, other than Christmas Day, and sometimes can be required to work extra shifts with only 24 hours notice based on business needs. Scheduling time off can be difficult as there are strict policies in place depending on the time of year. Wages are great, with timely raises for the first 3 years. After that, you max out, and a 3 year associate will be making as much as an 20 year associate. Communication is very poor in some departments between management and associates.  Not to mention there is no real consistency between the way managers handle situations, or relay crucial information. I really enjoyed working here at first, but it only took about a month to see that the direction the company was heading in, is definitely not the direction that Sam Walton wanted for his company.",2,Current Employee,Compliance Safety Asset Protection Associate ,"Coldwater, MI",1/1/20,2020,1,1

Walmart,Walmart is not a bad company. They tend to focus on what’s best for the company instead of what is best for everyone including the employees.

Would not recommend staying here long.,I worked for Walmart for 3 years and i can say i wont go back. Managers throw you under the bus for their own mistakes other departments do the same. I personally worked in lawn and garden and i was required to not only do my duties but help any other department that needed help and when one thing was wrong we were always blamed even if we weren't involved. We were called the trouble makers when we were the hardest working ones there and the company doesn't treat its employees fairly,2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Cherry Hill, NJ",1/1/20,2020,1,1

Physically demanding but you get used to it,Overall the job isn't that hard once you get used to it. It is very physically demanding because you're moving pallets and boxes weighing 40-50 pounds at times. The management could be a lot better by simply communicating more and associates between shifts could just give the people coming in a general overview of what they didn't get to because sometimes things would be a mess and you have to figure out what is what which takes away some of your time simply to start doing your job. What I can say I did like most was my coworkers but that is the same everywhere. You're going to like certain people and dislike others but I made some friends here. What I absolutely hated was having to zone everything. You find a bunch of items in places that they don't belong and oh my god does it get annoying but that's retail for you.,3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Victorville, CA",1/1/20,2020,1,1

Avoid at all costs,"This is a horrible place to work. They really make it look nice at first, with decent entry level pay, benefits, office amenities and such. But then you get to be there for a few months and find out some really shady things. Like how they don't pay holiday pay, they take out 8 hours of your PTO (if you have any) and pay you extra with that. You can't request an unpaid day off, you have to use PTO or get a point for an absence if you have no PTO. You only get about 1.5 hours of PTO per pay period starting out. There is only PTO, no sick time, no personal time, no vacation time._x000D__x000D_The software used to take calls and document them is archaic. They expect you to be so quick all the time but the software made that impossible. Regular 30 second load times while on the phone with a customer, it's embarrassing. After you end the call, you only get one minute before it starts counting against you so hopefully you didn't have to send this issue to the store or you would be past that one minute. Too many times I heard someone outright lying to a customer, and I was forced to do it as well. _x000D__x000D_I could go on.

They use computer based learning which is vague and doesn't really teach you much of what you need to know in order to do your assigned job, it's more of an overview of company practices and policies.

A hold over job,"Great co workers, pays well. Closed only one day a year. It's a place where if your aren't in with someone then you get unfair treatment at the store level.

Falls far from Sam Walton's ideals,"Working at Walmart, you either put on a fake smile or fall for the facade of being treated like a human. Depending on the store or the managers, everyone's experience may vary, but the consensus is management do what they please to see the store succeed, not the associate. For a company who's mantra is to treat each other like family and help one another, the reality is you have to be a model associate and fall in line with the standards of being a robot told to do everything by the end of the shift.

Worst Job of my Life..Go Work Fast Food I promise the People and Career Advancement is Better,"Walmart was the worst job I have ever had at 18 years old.  The final straw was an obnoxious customer was trying to flirt with me and my manager said it was because my shirt was too tight. She then preceded to go in the back and grab a men's polo size 2x and ask me to put it on.  I was around 115 llbs so the polo was more like a dress, I put it on top of my clothes and she said I was ""crazy"" in front of customers because she wanted to send me to the bathroom to change into it. Then she told me I owed her $5. I walked over to some bank ladies that I had befriended while working there and they encouraged me to quit and told me I could do anything with my life and I did not need this job. On my break I threw off the large shirt at the CSM counter (Customer Service Manager) and I quit. I have never left a job on the spot and do not intend to do it again. But the manager was so nasty in her approach blaming me for a weirdo customer that purchased products (cotton balls and tape) to only hand me at the end and leave ""to protect my breasts from the nametag clip"" I had on my shirt. Another time I was told by a manager that an elderly woman said I was ""too friendly"". The manager told me the feedback and said that she was probably wrong but maybe I could stop being so friendly and focus on the speed. What an absolute lie to say that they cared about customer service in the training. Also, the only source of positive reinforcement was a competition on who could ring up the most products the fastest.

Great until you promote to the salary level,"The company culture is a fallacy, you are only a number to them. They have made great strides in improving the image of the company to the associates during the beginning of their career, but the farther you go, the more you can see behind the curtain. Extremely fear-based company. Constant threatening emails from market, regional, and divisional management. Absolutely no work/life balance, you are always expected to be available. Schedule is a minimum of 50 hours a week. The only way the hourly associates will enjoy working for the company is if they have a salaried management team that care about them at all. Schedules generate with associates sometimes only getting 8 hours a week with an open availability. Never enough labor to really get the job done.

managment needs help,The management needs to look out for their employees more. I was being harassed for months and I had brought it to the head of the Walmart store and they did nothing if anything they helped the rumors about me spread.

Overview of my observations as a diesel mechanic,"My first impression was that the shop had a relaxed atmosphere, since there was always someone's music selection playing fairly loudly. My judgment was premature, as I would later realize. You will go through a plethora of out-dated training material, and you will be tested on some of that material. The Fleet Assist system being used tracks a technician's time down to the minute, and they require accuracy to that precision. For example, if you take a lunch break, you have exactly 30 minutes. If you are more than 1 minute late arriving to work, it's considered an ""occurrence"". There are no lunch options within a reasonable drive accessible within the time window you are allotted. This means you will have to take your lunch daily. This also means that the time waiting for a microwave, combined with the time to cook frozen food items, may result in a rushed ""prison style"" meal. They also require two 15 minute breaks daily, once again down to the minute. They do have cable TV in the break room, but it's somewhat redundant since you have to watch the time closely. The list of absolutes and rules is quite exhaustive, and many of the seemingly ridiculous ones result in immediate termination, if violated. It will be expected to grasp and operate within the Fleet Assist system fairly quickly, and not much leniency will be given for the fact that your first 2 weeks consists mainly of training in other areas._x000D__x000D_The job itself doesn't seem to involve much heavy engine work, although I did replace a clutch during my brief tenure.

Walmart as a Workplace,"Most people say negative things about there job because they hate working. My case is a little different. I believe Walmart did well for me. Helped me understand the customer's way of thinking. Helped me understand the human mind. Really helped me notice how passive-aggressive everyone really is. How hasty society has made us. With technology right there at our fingertips. We become addicted to having things the way we want it instantly, and when a customer doesn't get what they want they go off.

Standard,It’s a job if you need one. WalMart takes care of themselves and every employee is replaceable. Once you have time in with the company they will find a random reason to let you go.

Unorganized and poorly managed,I found during my time at Walmart that the management team is only looking out for their own position and their quarterly bonuses. They often tend to increase their bonuses by firing enough people to save money on payroll. There is a lot of fear of retaliation in most of the stores i have seen. There is always a lingering threat of termination regardless of ability and work ethic. There is never the ability to perform to your highest potential or even complete the regular job requirements. The workload is extremely high due to a lack of staffing. I have noticed that they usually operate at about 60% of the minimum recommended staffing per shift. This causes extreme stress on the employees as well as a drastic increase in workload. It almost seems designed to destroy your happiness and keep you from advancing for fear of being unable to balance your life outside with your work.,2,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Grapevine, TX 76051",12/23/19,2019,12,23

Moments of Care,"Starting at Walmart is a ideal place to begin. I work in the pharmacy as a manager. I worked for numerous other companies during my career and rotations. Walmart provides the GREATEST opportunity for growth, and not just corporately.

Everything is paid and paid-for. Though pharmacy is  becoming more saturated, walmart still provides multiple opportunities for movement. _x000D_Also one of the greatest initiatives within the entire company is the true north of moments of care. If a patient cannot trust their local pharmacy to provide optimal service with patient care at the forefront, then who can they trust?

Overall worst company I've worked for,"I'f I could rate Walmart a 0, I would. It was one of the most mentally and emotionally draining jobs I've ever done. The management did not care about the associates and were unrealistic in their demands in productivity in relation to the amount of associates we had to do those tasks. When we didn't finish a task, It didn't matter if the task took more hours then we had people, we were still looked down on for not finishing. I was personally talked down to, as were other individuals, because of unrealistic productivity goals. The benefits were non existent. It took too long to build up PTO (in my case roughly took 1 month just to have 8 hours worth of PTO), so like most people I had do use occurrences, which punishes the associate when it comes to bonus time. If you had occurrences or points on your record, the bonus you rightfully earned was deducted. After they changed the was bonuses were given out, I never received a bonus do to absences from illness. The worst part was definitely the management. We had a manager that associates had tried and tried again to complain about to the higher ups because of the way that her treated the associates. Nothing was ever done about it and the abuse continued. When shift change came, none of the shifts wanted him and argued about which shift was forced to take him. We ended up with him again. Because of this certain person we have had good managers either change stores or positions just to avoid him.

As being a former employee of this Shawnee Wal-Mart in KS, I was actually a transfer from a Kansas City store on church road. This Shawnee Wal-Mart is the worst when it comes to customer service. The employees are always complaining about something, mostly about management, and therefore nobody except me was ever in a good mood. Front end management is HORRIBLE!! They never know how to run things, nor give out breaks and lunches. They had VERY strict labor laws for minors, but management NEVER listened... Associates were constantly getting locked out of their systems due to them being on the clock for way too long! We had customers always yelling about something that was Wal-Mart's fault. Manager's would take forever to handle any kind of situation whether it was coming to approve a transaction it would take them 5 minutes to get there. Imagine on a Monday night when it's not too busy and you need to approve a transaction and you and the customer are just standing there looking at all the other customers leaving the store, waiting for this one little thing to be approved! One manager that was fired because of how she decided to run things, asked me about my availability when I was first transferred, and would schedule me outside of it! She had me 1:00pm-10:00pm and 2:00pm-11:00pm evenings AND weekends... who wants to work that as a student just out of high school??

To top it off, the store manager threw his book away and does it his way even against reginal marketing managers advice. I was on cap team one fresh area. Time given to complete task was insufficient, often short staff. Continuously cutting back hours, no employee can survive on 16 hours a week  I worked there for 14 years and 99% of the time received 32 hrs per week.

A decent first job/college job/second job,"The cashier and customer service aspects of the job are, in general, pretty simple and easy to learn. Most of the other employees are very helpful in learning new things and the workplace is very easy to integrate into. Management is often inconsistent and dysfunctional, however. This makes it very difficult to perform tasks smoothly or obtain adequate information about tasks or advancement opportunities. They are fairly flexible with hours and have decent pay. However, it is not uncommon to go several days (even weeks) without any scheduled hours. While it is possible to pick up hours, they're taken very quickly, and often there are not enough to make up for the lack of hours given. I would recommend Walmart to someone struggling to find a job, but to use caution. They do take notice of employees who intend to work there long-term as well as employees interested in moving into management (they prefer to promote form within, which is nice).",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Columbia, MO",12/18/19,2019,12,18

Cashier Position,"Most of the day you're standing in one position, just scanning groceries. Considering that for the most part it is just that easy, it's a pretty decent job. Lots of training on the computer, it's okay to ask questions and get help if you need it. It's pretty boring and if you don't have a social personality/ you have deep social anxiety, you're going to hate coming to work everyday. The customers are okay for the most part but just like anywhere else you have those customers that just do too much and when it is crazy busy, you're going to wish you were any other place but the more groceries you scan the faster time goes by. Hardest part of the job for me is trying to keep a conversation going with the customers and trying to keep a smile on my face, because i was just trying to get them in and out... but you got to understand that for some people, it is the only interaction that they get out of the day.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Fort Wayne, IN",12/18/19,2019,12,18

no support,"as easy as the task of cashiering is, this job has made it unbearable. the customers are extremely unhappy with everything that goes on so they often will vent to the cashiers as if we have any authority here.

It sure is retail.,"Pretty bottom-of-the-barrel work atmosphere, but Walmart pays more than more ""upscale"" retailers like mall boutiques. Depending on the position you enter, you can be paid a few dollars above minimum wage without having to deal with customers quite so much. Look for personal shopper/online grocery pickup positions. These are the highest paying entry level positions in the store. _x000D__x000D_The grocery portion is really not too bad. You have a big cart with up to 8 separate orders going on at once, and the handheld leads you through the store starting from dairy and going down through each aisle you'll need to visit. It's a busy job that will keep you on your toes, but will also help the day pass quickly. I found it to be pretty fulfilling to watch the number of items to be picked from the shelves go down as the whole team worked! Grocery pickup positions generally run in 9-hour shifts from 6 AM to 3 PM, so if you're interested, mark the department in your application and present your availability accordingly. Walmart will give you work weeks that are essentially full-time, but they will not offer you those positions if your availability doesn't agree with the time blocks required. _x000D__x000D_During the time I worked, management was being shuffled around and department managers were essentially useless. I've heard from other employees in other states that this is more or less typical; department heads generally don't have much idea what's going on. I had the most luck talking to my direct supervisors about any issues I had (mostly scheduling conflicts), and they would contact the department - more...",3,Former Employee,Personal Shopper/Sales Associate ,"Tampa, FL",12/18/19,2019,12,18

High Turnover Is company driven,"I have been employed now for over a year. I was first employed at one of the companies other owned businesses. About 250 of us were laid off. We were then asked to file applications for our jobs back with the same company laid off from or as direct employment with Walmart E-commerce team as CRT specialist. The position is the tier 2 position for the customer support, It is the last lvl of service if you have an issue as a customer. Thus we receive the higher escalated issues. Although being the ones to handle these more difficult issues, we are paid the same as the first lvl employees.The training lacks a great deal of information you very quickly realize when taking your first calls. The responses for said issues is to look up the information in the policy manuals online. This causes a great deal of delay for our customers. We are also not taught how to do any of the escalations through the systems for which we are working in. If assistance is needed the information is to be entered into a chat room and then you must wait most of the time an average of 4-5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge you need the help. At that time you still have to wait for them to assist as the first question is always,"" What did The Policy Manual say?"" Mind you, that there is a time limit you are to be assisting the customer in. Your employment is based on 3 stats. 1) Your call time, this includes any hold time you may need to research the issue and the manual as well as any time needed to get assistants from a supervisor._x000D_2) The surveys that are sent out to the customers after you end the call. for - more...",2,Current Employee,Customer Resolution Specialist ,"DFW, TX",12/18/19,2019,12,18

Decent pay but emotionally unfulfilling work,"A day on the job at Walmart is like going into a fugue state where nothing matters and very little of value happens. The work is so emotionally draining that you wish you could just shut off your feelings while working. The management is there, but usually distant unless they need something from you.

Decent Job for a while...just wasn't for me,"I worked here for around 8 months and I started out full time. They (the company and managers) work you to the bone. I worked 1pm-10pm everyday with 2 days off a week. Sometimes only 1 day off. Some might say that isn't bad, but the evening shift like this just didn't work for me. I never had time outside of work to see family or friends. Also, you work around a lot of teenagers who are lazy and immature. I would work my butt off and seemed to get no where. The managers took months to change my schedule from full time to part time. Then when I tried to change my schedule again, they didn't change in time for school season and I had no choice, but to call in to work because they scheduled me out of my availability. Overall, the company pays okay, but the work environment is disorganized, passive aggressive, and tiresome.",2,Former Employee,Fresh CAP Associate-2nd shift ,"Andover, MN",12/15/19,2019,12,15

Good place to work.,"I think walmart is always ""the place to go"" when you need a decent paying job. You can move up in the company or stay where you like for as long as you like. Management isnt always on your side but that's with most companies. And as long as you put in good decent work, you can excel. The company is making a lot of changes and if not for that, I would probably stay with the company for a lot longer... but unfortunately I think it's time for me to find someplace else to go.

They have now added on making sandwiches which is mainly morning crews job along with training more new people. What I have learned is that your opinions will only matter when it is convenient for the managers. Also, I have learned that when you don't have time to do another person's job they will write you up for it. Management is terrible. They are all over the place and some of them befriend other associates to the point where those certain associates get special treatment.

They fire you if you miss work for grieving the loss of a family member. Yes,  you get to learn a lot if you choose to, but that's the only perk.

It’s an alright job,I think Walmart can pay their employees more than what they pay them. I have done the math and know that they could.

The store I worked at had some favoritism issues, and the management was all over the place, sometimes good, and sometimes bad, but I realize that that isn't an indicator of every Walmart store. I did, however, learn a lot about the workplace. I learned how to communicate with people better, and people really enjoyed talking to me; both customer and coworker alike always praised me on my ability to make people happy with jokes or my general upbeat attitude. I think that was my favorite part about it: that I could talk to people and have friendly conversations while I was doing my job. It was really interesting talking to all sorts of different people.

"Wonder learning experience, but unusual higher ups.","I was a CAP 2 member. I would unload our daily delivery truck, then stock the shelves afterwards. The hardest part was getting all required merchandise on the shelves at the end of the day, usually the general merchandise. What I've learned was how to go about my job in the quickest and most efficient way possible to complete the job before the end of the day. However, there has been a high turnover rate for the supervisor position. The supervisor is responsible for assigning each team member to their position. I cannot speak for others, the reason why for the high turnover rate for this position in particular are just rumors. Rumors are that there are disputes between the supervisor and assistant managers on how to lead the team. But what I can say, is that we did go through a lot of supervisors. Some lasted longer than other. It reached a breaking point where one supervisor in particular did an amazing job and never raised his voice at anyone. However, he still got demoted. Half of the team protested by walking out. The Co-Managers (one rank below general manager) had to undo the demoting.",3,Former Employee,Grocery Stocker ,"Meridian, ID",12/13/19,2019,12,13

Walmart is a great place to work if you have the right managers,"If you like interacting with people and helping people, then Walmart is great. If you have the right management, they will give you the opportunity to advance. Some managers will not allow you to advance even if you are qualified. I learned that management can use some courses on how to treat their employees. Walmart's 10 foot smile rule should be followed by managers as well.

"Good people, bad management.","The typical day at Walmart was good, normally there wasn't an issue with the work itself. I learned a fair amount about maintenance work there and began security work because I was good at observation, I was fairly good at my job and wanted to stay longer. However, I wound up quitting because of exceedingly poor management. No manager in the maintenance team because he wound up quitting because of arguments with management above him ( a manager never replaced him by the way). Other maintenance members wound up quitting because nobody was around to talk about disagreements and other rising issues. Machines used to clean the floors kept breaking down and would be broken for weeks and couldn't be used. I was given a job in security, only to be constantly pulled back to maintenance which was severely understaffed, when I left there was 2 people left for the entire store on third shift to do maintenance. The work itself was good, pay was good, and the people I worked with were great. I did not want to leave, but I wasn't going to do the work of 2 and a half people with improper tools and equipment. Oh, and my store didn't recycle which I am pretty sure is a violation.",2,Former Employee,Maintenance Crew Member and Security ,"Fond du Lac, WI",12/9/19,2019,12,9

Barely recommend.,"It was a stable job I will give it that, but overloaded with tasks per person, and unprofessional managers that got away with treating their team poorly. open door policy is worthless when I had to deal with a situation of harassment. There was no disciplinary actions taken for the employees that regularly violated company policies, such as being overly direct with associates when there was an ""issue"" and often wasteful of products in the fresh production area, unsanitary, not following local health codes and general poor work ethic by disappearing for 30 minutes at a time each smoke or restroom break. _x000D__x000D_The Assistant Manager over Fresh Production at that time was a fantastic leader (I can't stress enough that it was not this specific manager that was the problem) but the team was not respectful, abused his absences (days off and vacations) by not working the same as if he were there; violating safety procedures, cleaning procedures etc. I honestly feel bad for the Assistant Manager because he worked really hard to bring the Fresh area up to where it needed to be. It was like the other assistant managers did not care what happened because it ""wasn't their area"" so ""not their problem."" _x000D__x000D_I probably would have had a better experience had the people been dealt with properly like getting written up or suspended after multiple offenses of violating company policies.

Management will help you find a place you're good at if you feel out of place in your department. Two 15 minute breaks with an hour (unpaid) lunch. Dental, vision, living death, accidental death insurance. They treat their employees well as compared to some of the other places I've worked. When they emphasize a team environment, they mean it.

production based but production isnt guarunteed,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consisted of unloading and organizing products off of the truck into stacks for various areas of the store.

Once that was done, the unloaders would clean the back room and help the stocking crew, if there was time. Management was strict about deadlines and efficiency.

great people to be around,"Most work days were good having friends that you make during your time working there. Sometimes it gets frustrating because management never knew what was actually going on. An example is that during the time i was a cart pusher, we would tell management that there is only one person outside trying to clear out a lot of a super store, and they would never send help to the stockman so we would struggle sometimes not being able to take our breaks until the last hour of work, also when we would tell  them that majority of cart are broken and that we do not have a lot they never listened to us and always complained about there being no carts even after saying hey we brought in all the carts from outside about 70% of the carts are broken in the back. where it then took them 3-4 weeks to get in new carts but in that time of waiting for new carts we were still constantly yelled at for having no carts inside even though there were no carts available outside for us to go grab.",3,Former Employee,Stockman ,"Kenosha, WI",12/8/19,2019,12,8

What it means to be gaslighted!,"Pay is better than most jobs like it, but Bentonville (Corporate) has their fingers in your pie constantly trying to manipulate everything often for the worse. They change things just to change them. You leave work and dread going back. About 60% of your customers think you are trash and treat you as such.

There is always a fear of retaliation if you try to speak your mind and they really don't care about your life outside of work.

physically demanding,I worked as an overnight stock associate. You worked in the store with few customers and it was typically pretty quiet and relaxed. The Job was physically demanding and you were expected to finish tasks in a timely manner. You worked with a relatively small team and job tasks were delegated into sections. Once you were done with yours you would assist the person the next person. You are expected to be self-sufficient.

Poor Leadership with Hostile Environment,"Over the years I heard a lot of great things about Walmart and the just in time process but while employed as a manager, I realized Walmart leadership was poorly trained and treated their associates like second class citizens. The company is so big that it does not value the employee. Instead of training their leaders and employees properly, it easier for Walmart to replace them. People work at Walmart because they need jobs  - not because they enjoy the work environment or culture. A significant number of Walmart managers walk in fear as they are given opportunities based on who they know and not what they know, which adds to the poor work environment and culture. The low level of professionalism and the realization that the culture may never change caused me to walk away with no regrets.",2,Former Employee,Quality Assurance and Inventory Control Manager ,"Union City, GA",12/7/19,2019,12,7

"Very physical, great pay, but be aware","My time here was short lived but it was great job if you enjoyed getting paid decent money to basically work out 10 hours a day. Very physical , very fast paced, and the pay is alright. I lost probably 25 pounds and was able to get a brand new car within literally 5 months working here. Order fillers are literally the backbone of this company and they go through them like nothing. But with the demand for the job it's not surprising. Expected to hit a 100+ rate while having to deal with jams, cases breaking while constantly standing and bending lifting anywhere from 2-70+lbs throwing usually 4500-5000 cases per day per person. My recommendation is apply for asset protection if available because I wish I would have when it was. Just be aware if you ever get injured, it is a huge hassle dealing with the whole process of trying to file a simple injury claim to cover your days off. It is a literal nightmare.

used to love the place.. not anymore its awful,used to love working at the place now it is nothing but misery. you are not recognized for your hard work unless you are favorited or unless there is something mentally/physically wrong with you. I know it is rude to say but only a select few are rewarded and they don't even do anything for the company. I have worked overtime a lot just to help get the job done because others do not know how. no one takes the job seriously. and if you are a good worker they take advantage of you and make you do everything. management doesn't do a thing for anyone and the front end is absolutely run very poorly. only good thing about this job is that they work really good with your schedule and the pay isn't bad whether you work full or part time.,2,Current Employee,Conestoga Parkway Lot 1- Cashier ,"Shepherdsville, KY",12/7/19,2019,12,7

Fast Paced,"This job is great for anyone who needs a few extra bucks in their pockets. Management tries to help in cases where they are needed, but mostly it is on the employee to fix things. Working here, a positive attitude is necessary as working with a few hundred employees you can start to feel like a number on a spreadsheet. Hardest part of the job is that they may cut hours from your schedule to keep their budgets in line. Some people will be cut 2-6 hours a week while others get 20+ hours cut a week depending on how long you have worked there. Raises are not given when you feel deserved, but just based on how long you work there.",4,Former Employee,Night Shift Mod Crew ,"Flagstaff, AZ",12/6/19,2019,12,6

slow and non career oriented,I have none. I didn't find that working there is an appealing place to work.

Productive,Walmart was a fast-pace environment that was always focused on meeting our goals. There was always days where we have to go above and beyond on what when had to accomplished.

There are other minor job duties. It's hard work--which I don't mind, but management doesn't recognize how tiring it is and often expect more from us than I consider reasonable.

A Nice Working Enviornment,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consisted of unloading and organizing products off of the truck into stacks for various areas of the store. Afterwards, products were moved to the respective areas and staged for the stocking crew. Once the initial unloading was done, the grocery truck was unloaded. Once that was done, the unloaders would clean the back room and help the stocking crew, if there was time. Management was strict about deadlines and efficiency. The hardest part of the job was learning the entire store by department numbers, but the best part of the job was being able to memorize them when unloading the truck.",4,Former Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Hobbs, NM",12/5/19,2019,12,5

Walmart doesnt value their associates,Walmart used to Value their Associates and customers more. Now it's just about cutting jobs using more technology and robots instead of people and have completely cut out so many jobs and cut hours. So there's barely anybody ever on the floor to help a customer and if there is they're so busy with all the stuff that gets thrown on them who has time for a customer. That's why a lot of Walmart associates are so rude these days.,1,Former Employee,Custoner service manager ,California,12/5/19,2019,12,5

Unorganized Management,Working for this company made me realize how work really is when working at a Distribution Center. The Management has no support for the employee.

People are treated like kids by the way Management tries to speak to the individual.,2,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate I ,"Chino, CA",12/5/19,2019,12,5
It varies,"Depending on your position, you can either have a very busy day or a very slow day. Management is all over the place, they do try to help you but sometimes it isn't enough and you might have angry customers. The workplace environment was mostly organized.

But was not appreciated and when they hired a new manager, a nasty ex-marine, who wanted everyone to submit to him, well everything turned 180 for me and I started to loathe working there.   So shortened my hours, but finally just quit because of the unnecessary stress.    They lost one of the best workers they ever had, and won't find anyone that can do what I did.

Last of a dying breed in retail..they hire real people,"Good enough place to work when you have to work!  Like a lot of employers now, there's a heavy focus on saving pennies (sometimes at the expense of operational efficiency} -- razor thin margins in retail pretty much dictate that part.  However, I hear the company culture changed dramatically after Mr. Walton passed away -- he cultivated a 'family' atmosphere.  The bean counters and consultants have taken over now, hence the priority to maximize the bottom line.  it's a good fit for some, especially if they're either early in career and have time to learn the business and climb the ladder or very late in career and making the last go round before retirement.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Honesdale, PA",12/4/19,2019,12,4

Alright Place to Work,"Walmart isn't great. They often require you to work holidays (especially if you work at one that is open for 24 hrs). The management depends on the store, they're alright at my store but they could be better. There are recurring problems that have been brought to their attention but have not been fixed. IT's kind of a lax job. I get to choose when I go on break and that's cool but that also depends on who your manager is. Cashiers aren't able to choose. They also don't give most people weekends off. The hardest part of my job (stocking) is cleaning up after coworkers who put items anywhere on the shelf instead of making sure it goes in the correct spot. This is all the time. But if you like repetition then Cap  associate is for you. The hours for the position are 4am-1pm, 5am-2pm, or 6am-3pm. I work from 5 to 2.

Standard fare at best,"Working as a cashier at Walmart holds carries much of the same expectations as any other cashier job. Some customers are rude, others friendly. You're expected to help organize and clean up when there's no customers to help. But there's always an incessant expectation to sell customers on applying for the company's credit card, and getting as many people through the line as fast as possible. Management stresses this to every single cashier, and insists that we make certain numbers on a daily basis despite that being out of our control, when customers don't want to sign up for a credit card. It never feels like your words have any kind of say in the company, and your actions are constantly being scrutinized; One wrong move, and any hopes of climbing the corporate ladder just fall apart.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Greenville, PA",12/2/19,2019,12,2

Terrible work enviroment.,"My assistant manager was hardly present at work. I was used to pick up her slack with the other department managers without proper training.

Absolutely the worst job hiring experience I have ever had!!,"I am 57 years old and, I can tell you, getting a part-time job at Walmart has been the most stressful and down right confusing experience of my life! I applied at the Raymore/Belton Walmart (amongst other places) in October, hoping for just a part-time job to go with my full time job, to make a little extra money. From the very first contact I received from them, it has been such a nightmare! Just trying to reach the person in charge of hiring (who left me the message) was almost impossible (which she informed me at my interview she does not have a special ext # or other contact # or, a way to leave her a message, nor did she ever display her schedule so one could at least know when she'd be at the store. Can someone explain to me how anyone could hold the position of hiring when they have no way to be reached, except to call the store & hope they happen to be there!) Then, once I finally did reach her and she set up the interview, telling me to go to Customer Service that day and have them page her, I was made to wait over 25 mins, all the while, being told by CS that they thought she had left for lunch and wouldn't be back for another hour. I was contemplating leaving when, at 26 mins after our scheduled time, she showed up, only to approach me and ask me my name.

Okay starting job,I worked for the company for 2 1/2 years. I lost my job because of false accusations without a proper investigation. I’ve read so many similar cases like mine and the exact same thing happened. No proper investigation and not by the book like they say they are. Management is also bad. They protect the people more that are higher up over the regular associate. But even though all that bad I’d still go back because the team I worked with was great and paid very well with great benefits,3,Former Employee,Stocker Associate ,"Sioux Falls, SD",12/1/19,2019,12,1

Old employee,"If you’re interested in working for retail stores etc. Walmart is a great company, it’s very easy. They give you 2 breaks, 1 lunch.

Wal-Mart is a great place to work and they pay well.,The work environment is great and I quickly became friends with my other associates. Management really seems to care about their employees and I became friends with my supervisors as well. They do a really good job of making you feel like you're part of a team. The hours are flexible and it was easy to get a schedule that worked for me. The only thing about working for Wal-Mart that I disliked was how hard it was to take time off with their 5 point system. A lot of people have to come into work even if they are very sick because of the point system. They don't accept doctors notes or offer sick time off which would often just cause other associates to get sick as well.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Coffeyville, KS",11/30/19,2019,11,30

"Get in, and Get out","I have been working at Walmart for almost a year and five months. Before working at Walmart, I have always looked down upon it for being disgustingly cheap, but now my feelings are even stronger. I started off as cashier for the first nine months. I was getting paid $11.65 an hour to put up with customers trying to lower the prices on items by ripping off barcodes, my managers playing Pokémon Go! on their phones when I need help and unhygienic customers speaking or even being around me. All I have to say is that I got lucky by even getting promoted at seventeen and start getting paid $13 an hour. It was hard and not worth the time nor effort. I say this job is good for high school students and nothing more. If you want to surround yourself by a bunch of failed abortions who take their jobs too seriously and stand in their college debt at age 80, then you do so. I say good luck to you and have fun trying not to get fired since you can only call out of work 4 times every six months.",2,Current Employee,Shoe Stocker/Jewelry Associate ,"Cedar Park, TX",11/30/19,2019,11,30
Walmart,"Managers are terrible and the dollar rules the way the train and teach their employees, always makes claims of hiring new employees but very untrue due to poor staffing, and when staffing is done of more employees are added to areas not necessarily in dire need of more employees.

I only liked working the Service Desk!,"I enjoyed working at the service desk where returns, refunds and many other things are done as it stays so busy at all times and it's very demanding. However, that's why I liked the Service Desk. I did not care to work the registers on the floor. I had 4 or 5 things that I was getting accomplished at the same time and to me that was fun, kept me on my toes and held my attention the entire time which of course, made your day go by faster.

dark and gloomy work day,"typical work day is work fast work hard so you can get done and then go home for at least four maybe five months out of the year your working good hours forty plus hours from like November to February the rest is usually short days not making forty hours a week barely making thirty hours a week, paid every two weeks. for the most of the time I was there I was making about twenty eight to thirty hours a week. they pride themselves and even tell you in the orientation that you are first and the customer second. that I can tell you is not true. pay is high but they get you on the hours so you really don't make money. and the benefits are garbage you either pay everything out of pocket yes they have insurance that has you pay upfront our of pocket and another that has a company spending account for you when you reach the full amount then you pay out of pocket. overall I would rate working there a 4 out of 10 you work 3 off 4 depending on where you work and what department your in. shipping was 4 on 3 off. good place for young kids and college kids. most enjoyable time was leaving for work everyday and going home.",2,Former Employee,Shipping Dock Loader ,"New Braunfels, TX",11/30/19,2019,11,30

Avoid at all costs,Walmart is one of the worst companies to work for you feel miserable every time you are there and if you work there in a decent position don’t expect to stay there for too long because they change your positions without warning they once sent out a teenager who had no snow gear on at all outside to push carts while it was snowing outside,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Tacoma, WA",11/29/19,2019,11,29

I learned a lot,I had worked there for 5 years and in the time I made life long friends and even found my husband who worked with me. There are so many opportunities for everyone.

Never Work for Causeway Walmart,"I worked 2nd shift at store #2387, and it was a fatal mistake to take the job. The top-brass management team at Causeway Walmart is trash, and creates a toxic work environment. Their goal has become maintaining barely passable levels of performance, versus making improvements to the operation(That's the standards of the Academy Store for you). Good managers at that location are both worked to death, on top of being eclipsed by the bad apples within the team. Their support managers and Sr. Co-manager won't perform department walk-throughs until either 2 hours passed your clock-out, or first thing in the morning in order to discredit and besmirch your workmanship. They'll hire you as part-time, but will schedule you like a full-time associate in heavy-traffic departments to void your eligibility for the company benefits. Their scheduling manager can't properly facilitate the store's needs with during the business weekend(Fri-Sun), even though they're over-staffed. Expect to be pulled from your area during those days to fill the void, and be told you didn't fulfill your department's tasks due to their inability to manage the store. There's no genuine communication within the management team either, so none of them can keep track of associates activities within the store. If you intend to work at 2387, be prepared to take photos and videos of your department before clock-out. Otherwise, be ready to be continuously ridiculed over doing your job to the absolute best of your ability through their underwhelming managerial skills.",2,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Brandon, FL",11/29/19,2019,11,29

Walmart is a fair place to work,I would have continued working at Walmart if one of the overnight assistant managers hadn't been getting after me for nonsense reasons.

They wanted me to learn more as a distributor. _x000D__x000D_Eventually I was sent for coaching and was told I was in the wrong position but they liked that I had so many great customer comments.

They are who you think they are.,"Walmart is so well known there should be no surprises. What did I know? I was surprised that at my first introduction to the Distribution Center was quite positive. I took the job just to help subsidize my income while I was waiting for promotion at other job. I ended up liking my job at Walmart so much I gave up the promotion at the other job and became an area manager with Walmart. I kept my other job for the part time income and better benefits. _x000D_I never let other job interfere with my scheduled shifts, but I was not as available to do ""Volunteer"" work because of the other job. I was jabbed at by upper management to quit, but I still worked both. _x000D_My problem came along when I decided to split hairs with an employee review. Since there was no ""official"" outline how to perform the review, I signed off that I had reviewed the employee, when I had barely spoken with her. She didn't like me, was connected to the right people, and knew where bodies were buried so I was fired for not giving an ambiguously defined review. _x000D_This particular facility was crooked, not all Walmart DCs are the same. This one had lots of dirty politics, marriages, divorces, and marriages to divorced people. It was quite twisted. Worst of all I was present in a meeting where the HR manager said they wanted to target certain associates and fire them. He also stated that if any ever mentioned this meeting it would be denied. _x000D_When I was fired I took my complaints all the way to the top, and I knew the right phrases and trigger words to get noticed.

A bad example of a successful bussiness,"I worked at the same Walmart for just about 2 years and the enjoyment I felt going into work slowly went away more and more with each shift. The schedules are subject to change daily, the management is poorly trained, and the employees are overworked. Overworked employees with no raise in compensation gives rise to a horrible work environment in which everyone dreads walking in.

A typical work day.,"A typical day at Walmart was you clocked in and walked up front to customer service to see if you could find a CSM and find out what you needed to do. Nine times out of ten they would tell you to check with the other customer host to see if they needed a break, if so give them one and then move on to the next person. The hardest part of the job was if you worked nights you had a very hard time getting someone to give you your breaks. They always let the cashiers go first. There where only two or three CSM's that would check with you to see when you needed a break or had had your break.

Good,Compensation is good for the work that needs to be done. The work is very demanding on the body and is easily 40 +\- hours a week. Working on holidays is a must but management is very helpful with anything you need to have schedule.,4,Former Employee,Freight Handler ,"Shelbyville, TN",11/25/19,2019,11,25
The overnight shift,"While working at Walmart, I was given the position of being an overnight worker when Walmart stayed open 24hrs. On the weekends we would have almost our entire night call in or just not show up. We would have hundreds of boxes that needed to be unloaded and stocked by the end of shift, the items also had to be inspected for damages. I never complained, I would get the job done as needed no matter how many people showed up to work. In my mind I knew I had job to do and it was gonna get done. I did my job with much happiness, and learned to be harder worker no matter what circumstances may arise.",5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Oklahoma City, OK",11/25/19,2019,11,25

The pay rate is the best part of the job,"In the Linden Walmart, most of the store only communicates when it comes to gossip. The managers are no exemption. I wonder how the new store will run. As a cashier you'll never truly feel appreciated. Managers (mostly CSMs) take the customer's words or their side in pricing issues or complaints. That takes a toll on the person after a while. Nothing is ever organized, communication is key. If the company as well as the management starting from the very top learned to do so effectively, things would change for the better. The new store manager is a rude individual. He rarely greets employees or acts professionally. While the new building is set to open on November 13th, communication and proper management must be the top priority, not just sales. Listening to the ""little people"" like cashiers is key to sales, overall. Customer's tend to get over way too much. I pray things get better next month! Lastly, the company is fraudulent with the pitiful 10% ""discount"" they give you after about 90 days. You don't realize at first but they tax you and say it's earned income when you use it and it only covers certain things. They have to do better!",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,1050 West Edgar Road,11/24/19,2019,11,24

Great place to work,"I started at Walmart in 2017 and after 5 short months I was able to promote to a customer service manager. They really worked with my schedule outside of work and allowed me to have days off to spend with my family. Sometimes I didn’t get as many hours as I would like but there were usually shifts available for me to pick up. The only issue I ever had is I felt I worked much harder than some of the others and was not paid accordingly.Ultimately left for a job that paid more, but I would go back if I could work there as a supervisor again. The associates there are very friendly and welcome new employees with open arms. The facility is very well ran most days.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"McGehee, AR",11/24/19,2019,11,24

When you can't find a job anywhere else...,The culture of the biggest of all big box stores is about too many tasks and only enough time and tools to complete one.

Either dead end or worked to death,"If you're thinking about applying at any Walmart, the best advice I can give you is to scope out the place first & pay attention to their work ethic. Without a decent team behind you, this job is rubbish._x000D__x000D_The biggest problem most locations have is a lack of proper management. Usually, more often than not, members of management are not on the same page with one another, resulting in many inconsistencies in work ethic & following company policies which can result in other employees getting in trouble simply just for listening to what they're told to do. Others who argue with management in order to refrain from breaking policy or what the store manager wants commonly get in trouble for insubordination._x000D__x000D_Employees in any position are commonly put through minimal training, usually limited to training modules on a computer. Cashiers usually end up shadowing either absolutely no one or more than a dozen other people, which would usually be good for experience, but commonly clashes with other training & ends up being confusing._x000D__x000D_Anyone looking to move up in the company commonly have to be a part of a managerial clique in order to get noticed. In most cases, hard work & good work ethic get you nothing other than a pat on the back. If you're lucky enough to get noticed, many managers will simply use an interview for a promotion as an incentive to get more hard work out of you & then simply never interview you.

Its what you would expect,You learn to work with the people that are hard working and stay away from those who aren’t. Management is constently giving you side tasks then wonder why on earth you didn’t finish stocking what ever product its your job to stock. The vast majority of people are only here a couple of months if that because no one wants to stay and deal with their garbage. If they would leave us alone and let us d our jobs the turn over rate would be much lower,1,Current Employee,Fresh Cap II Associate ,"Baytown, TX",11/22/19,2019,11,22

Walmart as a company,"Walmart as a company has pretty decent morals, however, every Walmart has a different feel to it, unfortunately management really does influence whether or not you will enjoy your time with the company or dread it.

Eugh. No,"Walmart sucks to work at. They tell you integrity is important, and that they value YOU as an employee, but they care about money, and customers, and if you don't get done on time they freak out. Get done with what? They're disorganized, it's hard to find a manager to ask what you're supposed to be doing, then they get mad you didn't magically just KNOW what department you were suppose to be working. The training was god-awful (not from my co-workers- they were all very nice! The management mostly is awful. Maybe 1-2 good managers out of a dozen) I was thrown on the job in rush season with unclear directions, with barely two days of training when I started. When people call out the managers get mad and take it out on you. The pay starts between 11-12$ depending on the area you're in; stockers have much rougher jobs than the grocery pickup people, but get paid less which is strange. _x000D__x000D_The ONLY good thing about the job is the coworkers, because again, they were all really kind and more helpful than management when I had a question. At this point I just go ask a coworker rather than a manager, and I've gone full days several times without SEEING a manager; I have no idea where they hide at, they're NEVER in the office. It's wild._x000D__x000D_If you can find something that pays better, peace OUT and don't look back.

It’s a Job,I’m a pt college student & Walmart has been somewhat flexible with my school schedule. The Walmart fails to recognize talent in a rewarding manner & also is the king of taking away from their employees & giving less benefits/support.

Making those workers have to call in, take time to go in and fix their mistake or have them fill out a new availability.

Very physical`,Unreasonable standards on production time.  The whole reason they can't keep good hard working people is because the goals are unreasonable and just push people way too hard.

You call out you get 2 points. You call out on a weekend and it's 4. You're 10 minutes late or 10 minutes leave early it's 1/2 a point. You have until you get 7 points before the fire you. They do not expect doctors notes or ER notes. You are expected to work even if you have a fever or are throwing up. A different breed of human shops at Walmart.

A negative mark either an occurrence or a ""step"" (1 step= 4 occurrences), both last 6 months. If you have 3 occurrences & they're going to be removed after 6 months but it's 5 months & 29 days but you get another occurrence.  This puts you at a ""step"", therefore restarting your time for another 6 months. Walmart claims there's no favoritism or retaliation but, many will advise just try to stay out of the spot light. You can also get a ""step"" as a write up as a first warning or even a ""step 3"" which means any more & you're terminated. It really depends on the manager & if they like you. I've seen an ops manager speak with 4 employees for over half an hour (2 hrs wasted & no write ups). Same manager then gave another employee a step for talking & yet, they only wrote up 1 employee although they were both talking to each other._x000D__x000D_Seems Walmart has no loyalty for veteran employees, if employee takes care of you...return the favor.

"Nope, just NOPE!","I'm surprised that I lasted six months. I was probably going to get fired anyway because I was unable to finish my computer training in order to get a dollar raise. Why? Because one of my managers REFUSED to send me back there to complete them, and I worked with them all the time. This same manager fussed at you for so much as asking another co-worker how their day was. I saw them tell someone to leave for the day for dancing while waiting for a customer. Not anything major, just a little happy dance, because they were having a good day. No matter what you did, it was wrong. You could have done your job by the handbook, and it was wrong. You did it that manager's way, you were wrong. There was literally no pleasing this person. If you made a mistake they would yell at you in front of customers, holding up your line even more, so that they could yell at you about that too. This ONE manager made my life at this job a living nightmare. When I left I told them it was for another job, because I was scared of what that one manager might do to me if they had gotten talked too. I still have an anxiety attack when I go in that store and see them. There is no communication with the managers, and there are too many managers. Managers from other departments telling you to do something opposite of what your ACTUAL manager told you to do. It's just a circus. It's not worth it. That ONE manager made me cry more than any customer ever did. My worse customer was a SAINT in comparison._x000D__x000D_Also....don't get sick, because that's a Point of your record.

"High Expectations, Little Help, Toxic Managers","Managers often tasked stockers to more work than was able to be completed in one shift (ex. tasked to 12 hours of freight in a 7.5 hour shift). Overnight employees were expected to pick up the slack from other shifts, often being coached for work left by other shifts. Gender discrimination was common, and actively encouraged by management. Training isn't followed including putting stockers on register with little or no training and are ignored by CSM's when help is needed.

"Decent pay if you work enough hours, many areas that need improvement","Being a CAP 2 associate, you're sometimes referred to being a part of the most important job in the store which I can agree with. I just wish you were treated that way. From not always having the correct amount of materials to complete work efficiently, and ridiculous expectations for work completion times, you always feel like you're on your toes in this fast-paced job. It also doesn't help that most of the time you don't even know where your supervisor, or anyone from management is most of the time, which was a huge learning curve when starting out the job. They also expect you to learn where every product is extremely, while also expecting you to hit the same completion times as someone who's been at the job longer than you have been. I will say that once you learn where things are, and roughly what to do when situations come up, like a spill or any other similar roadblocks that might come up during work, it's easier to know what to expect. Is the $11/hour pay worth it? If it's your last option for a job, then sure, but I would not recommend this job to someone else nor would I want to start out at this job all over again.",2,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,Illinois,11/18/19,2019,11,18

After doing day stock for about 3 months I checked my schedule and i was cut to 24 hours for that week and the next one too. That is not full time   I asked who was in charge of scheduling and I was told my availability changed... I never changed it at all  so I asked for an availability sheeit and corrected it   Only then did I find my pay was cut  I could go on and on but Walmart jips their employees and cuts back on pay to save money  you will be lied to and never you think a problem is solve until you have seen the solution.,2,Current Employee,Product Stocker ,"Madison, AL",11/18/19,2019,11,18
