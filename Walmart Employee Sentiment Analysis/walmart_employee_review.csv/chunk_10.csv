Parents,The attendance policy doesn't take into account single parents.

The only thing I didn’t like was some of the people there like to talk about people even the Customer,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bennettsville, SC",2/25/20,2020,2,25
Advancement,There are no opportunities for advancement in this company unless you have twenty or more years of work experience at this facility. The culture here is great but to advance is impossible because people are only promoted by agreement which means saying yes without question. I’m a long time associate here and I love the people and benefits which are offered by the company.,4,Current Employee,RSR Driver ,"New Braunfels, TX",2/25/20,2020,2,25

It is a good place to work for all people.,"Best job I’ve had so far. _x000D_The job alone changed my personality into someone who has great people skills and an ability to solve issues very quickly and with care. The customer service management staff was the best I’ve ever seen. They handle everything with the utmost professionalism and class, I was told my chances of advancement were high even though I had only been there for 2 years. I met all kinds of people and that has been a very rewarding experience with many great memories. The good far outweighed the bad. I would love to work there again if I could",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Saginaw, TX",2/25/20,2020,2,25
Rough gig,Walmart is Walmart. Greedy production will always get in the way of treating employees correctly. Break your back for 6 months or so and get fired .. so on and so forth.,1,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Wintersville, OH",2/25/20,2020,2,25
Underpaid and undervalued,this complaint is a bit outdated considering Walmart has upgraded their pay grade but when I was employed there I was under pay for my years of experience in the grocery industry,1,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Burlington, NC",2/25/20,2020,2,25

Employees not prioritized,Constant cuts and personnel changes made it difficult to establish any sort of consistency in expectations and tasks. The scheduling was often a mess as our HR department was downsized and one person was stuck with the work of 3 people,1,Current Employee,Associate ,"Meridian, ID",2/25/20,2020,2,25

Turn over rate above 60%,This work place is a very hostile place to work. Employees form cliques and gang up on each other. Not a professional place to work. Managers are not present nor trained to work in their own departments. I felt like I was in high school. Do not work in the bakery or deli it is very stressful and disorganized. The turn over rate at Walmart is above 60% which says it all.  But I think the corporation itself is trying to take care of employees fairly. The corporation is failing on the lower management level and human resources at my store was never helpful.,2,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,Washington State,2/25/20,2020,2,25
Great people to work with!,Stocking manager was awesome. When I went to the on-line expeditor I didn't feel as happy. _x000D_The training videos are great. The benefits are wonderful also.,4,Former Employee,Online Expeditor ,"Marinette, WI",2/25/20,2020,2,25

Felt at home and never went home upset.,5,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Covington, VA",2/25/20,2020,2,25
What you can learn.,Unfortunately no matter how hard you work to make the company proud of you. You have to be in the click or your nobody. Very unfortunate because good hard working employees get passed over.,3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Porterville, CA",2/25/20,2020,2,25
hard but worth it,benefits as well as paid time off on the job tanning opportunity. the management was all was helpful with any and all questions and problems that might arise in the warehouse. the warehouse itself was all ways dependent on the weather hot or cold wet floors in the rain,4,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Statesboro, GA",2/25/20,2020,2,25
come in and open bay doors and start checking in cars until we get done and if there ain’t any cars then you need to clean the shop,Management sucks if you are not up there butts all day long then they think you are the bad guy and they have no respect for anyone including the older ones there,1,Former Employee,Technician ,"Wytheville, VA",2/25/20,2020,2,25
Horrible place to work and managment sucks,Walmart has great pay if your a low income family and really need the money. But they treat their employees wrong and don't appreciate the work that they do.,1,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Columbus, MS",2/25/20,2020,2,25
need a better boss,Im usually by myself dispensing orders to the customers. I never have time to quality check cause im to busy. Theres surpose to be at least two people in the back to help. They are permoting a guy who doesn't help or do anything. Women need help with heavy items and he wont help. He takes stories out of context and lies about them. Had  meeting about are area and he lied no one asks for him. He constantly leaves us without telling where he goes and never wants to dispense. We complain about him and nothing is done about it. There letting sixteen year olds dispense and theres items that ask for id to make sure there of age. LIke gum to help you stop smoking and cold medicine. Spit days off people have kids and things to take care of. They say we will get no hours and try to scare us not to do it.,1,Current Employee,online shopper ,"Wasilla, AK",2/25/20,2020,2,25
Write orders,Like  any other big company expected to do the job of two or three people.   What you to to do it for what seems like ok pay but for the things you have to do are under payed compared to management,3,Current Employee,TLE Sales Associate ,"Pikeville, KY",2/25/20,2020,2,25

Don’t apply to stock or cashier. The job overall is bad they pay good for young adults. But the managers don’t care about you at all.,My work experience for Walmart was good at first but as time went on I realized that my supervisor was racist. And my manager didn’t really care about his workers. They just wanted you to push your self above limit and feel exhausted. Once I asked to switch positions my manager wouldn’t let me and he would go outta his way to make me look bad. And not let me leave. And I also got let go for getting a drink of water and telling the manger that’s what you on bro,2,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Mishawaka, IN",2/25/20,2020,2,25
Overall a good company to work for.,I very much enjoy working for Walmart. I have learned vast amounts of knowledge.  I was promoted quickly based on my quick learning ability.

Cloak and dagger,Walmart is eliminating management positions but still hiring for the positions that are being eliminated.  The Senior leadership in the interview will not tell you that your job is going away in a few months and that you all will have to re-apply for a new job.  The roll out of GWP has left everyone confused and unsure of their future.,2,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Pennsylvania,2/25/20,2020,2,25
Decisions,"everything in life depends on what you are looking for personally. If you are looking for something temporary then Walmart can’t be beat. But, if you are looking to build and establish a career it might take u some time to do so at wally’s world and that’s only because it’s a long line ahead of you.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Wilmington, NC",2/25/20,2020,2,25
"Professional, attentive to detail, and willingness to learn","Working in retail is a labor of servitude. It takes an understanding that you are there to meet the needs of the customer. As a manager in retail, your customers are both internal and external. One must be competent and humble to serve for sets of customers. As a manager, one must be willing to learn and constantly professional as well as relentlessly attentive to detail. This is not a position for everyone, but for those who fulfill the above mentioned characteristics, they will flourish and advance quickly.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Roswell, NM",2/25/20,2020,2,25
The company only cares about the money they can make.,"This was by far the worst company I have ever worked for. I was getting billed by a man 4 times my age and no one in management would do anything about it even after it was caught on video with many witnesses. I went to ethics soon after, it got turned back over to management and I ended up getting billed by management to the point of me having to quit because it was just to unbearable.",1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Florence, AL",2/25/20,2020,2,25

Things I do at Walmart,I started off my night by down stacking the freight that came in. It usually takes about 30 mins to an hour depending on how much we get. The hardest part of the job is finishing on time.,4,Current Employee,Frozen/Dairy Associate ,"Albuquerque, NM",2/25/20,2020,2,25
unwritten rules,There was an unwritten standard of unloading 5 carts per shift that I found to be difficult. Otherwise I thought the job was good and I would have maintained employment if I could have.,5,Former Employee,ASSOCIATE ,"Lisbon, CT",2/25/20,2020,2,25

"Not a bad place to work, just poor management.","the managers wanted me to lift the 58 pound bags of dog food on my own, and get 3 pallets done within an hour (each pallet has about 40 bags on it and they are not separated by brand or type, just all thrown on the pallets). Now, yes, it would definitely have been possible if I had more muscle, but being only 95 pounds, they were asking way too much of me every time they put me in the dog food isle.",2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Lapeer, MI",2/25/20,2020,2,25

"Good company to work for, just very political. Easy to start at bottom, takes time to advance. A good manager makes the store and environment enjoyabl","Always keep to yourself, do your job and trust no one. Lots of backstabbing by Assistant Managers to get ahead.

"Very fair pay for simple work, not very encouraging environment.","May change from location to location. My experience just wasn't what was mentioned in the beginning, no sense of belonging, no tight knit crew, management didn't seem to care much either way. Pay was very fair though. Not a flexible schedule, the point system was a bit excessive, coworkers mostly stood with one another to exchange gossip. The work is not difficult, and may have been nice with a better chain of management",2,Former Employee,Cap 1 Associate ,"Gillette, WY",2/25/20,2020,2,25

Typical Sociapathic Corperation with no care for associates.,"Hardest part of the job is not quitting. Worked for company 3 years as a supervisor, company doesn't care about you in any way shape or form. Utilize their assisted college education benefits otherwise you are wasting your time and throwing away a piece of your soul everyday you are there. Customers verbally, and occasionally, physically abuse you without any repercussion. You can get terminated for no reason, which is literally stated within company's policy. Don't work here unless you want the college benefits.",2,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"San Antonio, TX",2/25/20,2020,2,25

"Good job for employees, not the best salary Management Job","The job for employees is great and offers decent pay, benefits and work life balance. Salary Management is too challenging for work life balance. You do get great vacations. 6 weeks off but when your on your really on. On call after work, weekends, holidays etc. The corporate headquarters  has a good direction of change towards competing with Amazon. Great technology, smarter work process. The challenge is that the company can't legally terniate store managers who have been in rolls to long. So the differennt stores struggle to follow processes and managers that have been there 20 years manage from 20 years ago. I came as an external, expected to be fired. Was of course but the problem is external training is awful and your expected to be fired because of politics. The normal. So to me. I'd say work for Walmart as an employee. Not a salary manager.",3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Yucca Valley, CA",2/24/20,2020,2,24
Its ok.,Biggest down side is even with doctor and hospital notes it goes against your attendance points. And 5 your fired regaurdless of circumstances. So 3 days in hospital for poison snake bite. Required 24 hrs before non contagious on strep throat. One day car wouldnt start had it towed and fixed. And 2 days in hospital for enlarged almost bursting spleen and thats it.  Management had problem woth scheduling not because of ability but just they couldnt get ot roght and often led to being locked out of the register and not being able to go anywhere becaise there was no one you could give keys to. Positive had some really good people and customers.,3,Former Employee,Sporting Goods Sales Associate ,"Livingston, TX",2/24/20,2020,2,24

Not a happy place,"Once upon a time, it was a good company to work for... they cared about the employees and their well being.

Need Improvements,"Good company but the culture has changed. Poor management in place. Training for management  and associates needs improvement. High turnover. No work life balance.

However, if something happened and someone needed time off (for example: maternity leave, sick child, family death) the managers that were above my front end mangers were not kind. I never had a problem personally but it always left a bad taste in my mouth to witness. The actual job was fairly easy and fun when I got to know my coworkers and regular customers.

I enjoyed working with the associates there and getting to know them.,The hardest part about my job would be just making sure that you are prioritizing your day.  You need to make sure that you are following up on everyone to make sure the tasks are getting done.  Also within that time frame you are taking care of associate and customer needs.

Overall,"Depending on the store management isn’t so great they don’t really care about to the people, they care more for politics and getting the system going..

Very high expectations and moderate support,Getting things done that require computers and technology which are at best somewhat reliable can be difficult and the small margins mean you will have a small crew to do most of the work that is needed.

Management needs improvement,"Low wages, might have to stay over your time and management is always on you. Associates kissing a** to get promoted.

I would HIGHLY recommend this job.",5,Former Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Newport, TN",2/24/20,2020,2,24
Be aware of extra work that isn't yours,"I'm not saying all Wal-Marts are like this but be aware of it. I worked a year and the management was more worried about getting everything perfect the way they thought was appropriate without regard for who is actually doing the work. It's very easy to see who can walk around and do nothing without consequences.While someone else has to do everything even if it's not under their job titles to pick up the slack and get in trouble when one small thing goes array. Now, it's fine to help out your company because you are employed under them but when you're in a different department everyday, not doing your actual job, well it gets tiring. Again I'm not saying all Wal-Marts are this way but my experience for a year under their employment showed me that their employees don't mean as much as making money does and, that management can do as they please.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Hartford, CT",2/24/20,2020,2,24

"Daily grind. Come in, do your job, leave.  A job, not a career.","As a cashier you stay busy the majority of your shift.  There are some down times and you will be asked to help re-shelve items or zone aisles.

Horrible!,Worked there for 15 years and the politics are enough to destroy your self esteem.  Hard work doesn't pay. If you are young and cute you will do well and move up quickly.

You still had 9 occurrence limit but you earned paid time off (PTO). That was great. Loved it. 2019 hits and they started to integrate better work place. You get limited to 4 occurrences (5 you're fired) paid time off is now split into protected pto and regular pto (making it harder to earn both). Your quarterly bonus is now based off attendance. So, god forbid if you get sick and need to call out, your chances of myshare drops. Key event dates are now into the mix, you call out on the day, you get 2 points. On top of that hours are being cut, extremely bad that employees have to get another job or file for partial unemployment. People who have been with the company longer make $1-$2 less than new hires. Well, here is my last straw, i have been working there for 5 years and make $1 less than new hires for my position. I asked about a raise on my anniversary. I was told I had to wait like everyone else. Well, i find out that if you have occurrences, you don't get a raise. Raises were based off of productivity. Now it's all attendance. It's bs to punish hard workers because lazy people abuse the system. I also want to point out that the store I work at has a real problem with favoritism.

"Every location is different, it would seem.","A Walmart can be an almost pleasant place to work, or it can be a nightmare.

Poor work life balance for salaried management.,Poor upper management. Absolutely too much work for the pay. The expectations are too high for the amount of pay offered.

Worst place to work ever,"This job broke me. When I started at Walmart I was happy and excited, I did my hair and makeup everyday. The longer you work there the more your soul just dies. You get taught how to do things in your store and the next day its different and then this manager wants it this way but the store manager said this. Walmart is pure chaos and favoritism. The only time you see managers do anything or care about anything is when corporate appears. Management doesn't care, they just don't. My department had 2 people and we both would get pulled and left to die day after day and then our manager would have the audacity to ask why does it look like this or your area is a reflection of your work... stuff like that makes you snap. Its also hard working your butt off and they just keep hiring people who don't know how to work or do anything and they don't want to. On my best day I worked better than most Walmart associates hired after me but they don't care, you could hard all day and the one thing you didn't get to finish they make you feel horrible about it. Walmart's will never run well because people who get promoted are the people who sucked up and the good workers and people who actually care are left on a hamster wheel until they eventually stop caring and become another broken Walmart zombie.

Bureaucracy at its finest,Walmart is a stereotypical company that doesn't care about its employees.

There is basically no real chance to develop one's career unless you do things that shouldn't be asked (most of the time). If a raise is given it is the bare minimum and payment is always enough to stay below the poverty line.,2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Barbourville, KY",2/18/20,2020,2,18

Stress inducing,I have work for them for 6 years as a graveyard shift and know everything about the store. I was passed over 4 times for a supervisor position for someone that's way less experienced. The stress that managers put on Associates is just unbelievable. If it wasn't for the pay I'd quit,2,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker/ Cashier ,"El Paso, TX",2/17/20,2020,2,17
A Typical day at Walmart,The manager never last long we had to  get a another manager  every month and   the only thing I hated was when they made my department go work  in another department because they didn't have a nuff worker's  and I  didn't like working in the other department,4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Oklahoma City, OK",2/17/20,2020,2,17

A tolerable work place.,Walmart is an acceptable place to work if you're short on options. The pay is decent and getting hours is rarely a problem. Try to avoid Store 1 though as it is a very toxic environment.,3,Former Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Rogers, AR",2/17/20,2020,2,17

The Customers,"My customers make my day, no matter what I am going through I can not let my customers down. I provide a clean environment for my customers and I go out of my way to provide that. Wal-Mart was build on three principals one being respectful to others and treating people with Integrity and I hold myself accountable for that. _x000D_At Walmart we try to provide our customers with amazing product at a lower and affordable price. I love what I do and my customers come first.",4,Current Employee,Pharmacy Clerk ,"Hueytown, AL",2/17/20,2020,2,17
Okay place to work. Definitely not the worse .,"Walmart is an okay starter job. The work is pretty simple. If than thing its supervisors that make it more complicated. They're very set in their ways and sometime it feels there little flexibility. They'll have guidelines of how long the work should take to finish and they stick to that even if they know the numbers aren't completely accurate. They don't reward people for going above and beyond. Rather they restrict us into roles and to do no more no less. I see management overworked and overburdened. This is a problem because if I make them aware of a problem sometimes it just gets ignored. There's a lot of passing the buck from one shift to the next. People don't get held accountable. When I started working there there was a stronger sense of teamwork. Now it seems like people care less. And its strange to say all this because I compare my Walmart location to others I've been to and our is run a lot cleaner than others. Associates are more helpful here. But were not rewarded though and I think that's the general frustration. Poor management, feeling underpaid. The store tends to order much more of certain products than it needs and then has no enough backroom storage space. And sometimes the miss a zero and they get 1000 clip strips instead of 100.",3,Current Employee,CAP2 Associate ,"Glendora, CA",2/17/20,2020,2,17

Ridiculous,"The company has poor communication skills and is unreasonable most times. It felt like I was always set up for failure. They would complain that we are short-staffed and proceed to cut everyone's hours. Your raise and bonuses are based on your attendance. They had unreasonable expectations so nothing ever gets done. Management would never be of much help. They cut my hours based on 'poor attendance'. The attendance system is ridiculous anyway. I tried hard to move to different departments but they wouldn't work with me. They expect other associates to train new hires when it is the manager's job.  They DO NOT accept doctor's notes. They cut my hours from 40 to 20 because of my poor attendance. Also, their health insurance is terrible!

Walmart-Cashier,I believe what stands out that most in this company is the time and effort the boss/managers put into talking to their associates and giving them what they need.

At best, it was okay, no-one breathing down peoples necks in order to get everything done around the store, no-one yelling to stay late or threatening termination.

Working for Walmart,A typical day in Walmart as an online grocery pickup associate involves a great deal of independent work. But that doesn't mean that teamwork isn't important. Team effort plays a huge factor with this position. If there is a lack of team communication the entire team can suffer. But I always keep up team productivity by encouraging and assisting my fellow associates. The managers in the overall store may not be the greatest but they are usually friendly to talk to. The hardest part of the job is when the real higher ups keep adding excessive amounts of work to us when we lack equipment and workers.

A busy Retail place where you are guaranteed the hours.,"Walmart is pretty busy on weekends and holidays. The management for most part is pretty good at their jobs. Most of them will sit down and talk to you about schedules if there's problem. The enjoyable part of my day is when I get customers that will have great conversations with me or when I help out other departments because they are short staffed, and we are a team so we always help each other out. I learned how to be better with customer service from working at Walmart as well.",5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Appleton, WI",2/12/20,2020,2,12
The discount and incentives,There was little to no training. After your first day in orientation they pretty much throw you to the wolves. Training has to be demanded and did I mention Lack of training.  There was no willingness to help from older employees. The company barely gives you time to do requirements like mandatory trainings on the computer. Management never gave feedback on performance. Professionalism did not exist.,2,Current Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Macon, GA",2/12/20,2020,2,12

Definetely the place for someone who enjoys hard work.,"A typical day at work here is about 10 hours long. I learned how to stay on my feet for long periods of time.

Was a better company to work for in 2007 then now,Company provided extra training for my promotions to be able to perform the job to the best of my ability. Had both awesome and horrible managers.

Great place to work,"I got along well with all of my fellow employees. ""Most"" customers were great and I did engage with everyone. But in any customer service industry jobs you have some people that are just a hassle and are just being a demanding jerks.

Wal-Mart is a great place to work overall and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great part-time job.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service/Deli Associate ,"Cranberry Township, PA",2/12/20,2020,2,12
More non-sense policies than necessary,"If you're interested in working for a place that only recognizes you by your ID number and not you as a human being, you're set and ready for success. There's a lot of people there that don't do their job that others have to pick up the slack for and the managers call that ""team work."" You get 4 strikes for absenses and you're out. They don't care about your well-being even though they say they do, and remember- you're just a number. However, if you suck up to management either in your own department or others, you really will go very far in the company. The pay is pretty good and so are the benefits, but as a human being, they suck with that. Oh, and, there's also NO lunch break. You get 2 on the clock breaks for a few minutes, then you're back at it.",2,Current Employee,Inventory Control-Quality Assurance Associate ,"Bethlehem, PA",2/12/20,2020,2,12
Good benefits but company is in the midst of tremendous change,"Walmart has good benefits and very competitive pay. Work/life balance can suffer at times due to the demands placed upon employees.

Very rewarding experience,"In this position you are a decision maker and you have to be very agile. You will work a minimum of 10 hours, but usually work 12-16 hours a day.

"it was a productive employment for maintenance, safety, and customer service","The job wasn't too hard, it had a few function qualities but they were all simple and it only required common sense. Primarily i just stocked goods from our inventory and organized them, but needed to always be available  to help a consumer or to keep the place neat and safe.

Unorganized Company,"Very unorganized company!! None of the mangers are on the same page, different rules everyday! Most mangers are lazy and set on their phones in the office instead of helping. Management will walk right past work that needs attention just to get you to do it. They have talked their way out of MANY LAWSUITS! It’s extremely HOT in the summer time, due to air being broken. Been broke for years, and still isn’t fixed. Some friendly associates but way too much drama! Only way to get moved up in the company is kiss someone BUTT!

Hard to balance home and work life,"The people at the top have never driven a truck. They have way too many rules for the average truck driver to follow.

Would not recommend,"Walmart is a place where you have to “know someone” to advance within the company, even if you are the most qualified. There’s no balance between personal life and job life.

good work good people but management oftentimes cares more about work times than actual employees even to the detriment of their own schedules,Through the three to four years I have worked there the workplace was often very nice and had very good customers and people in it while not all the management was great those who were really stood out my only grievance is the management directly above me it would oftentimes so laser focus onto finishing on times they would ask things that outright didn't make sense such as getting a 3200 peace truck done in an hour and 30 minutes even though a 2600 peace truck we would barely get done in 2 hours and honestly kept getting worse until we were asked to finish entire pallets which would take us anywhere between an hour and 30 minutes to two hours to be done  in 30 minutes,3,Former Employee,Walmart cap 2 ,"Minot, ND",2/12/20,2020,2,12

"Job was nice however, they do not woek around your personal schedules","Job was nice but some of the managers do not treat employees equally and some managers have favorites and it certainly shows.

They give you attitude if you ask off for Thanksgiving day and tell you there is not enough coverage, even if you request it off 6 months in advance. Your schedule fluctuates",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Clearfield, PA",2/12/20,2020,2,12

Very poor management at the walmart I was employed at.,"There was a lot of things going on that no one cared to fix . The pay was good but the treatment was unfair.

Walmart has changed a LOT!,"When I started my job at walmart 18 years ago I LOVED it! It was very family oriented, the managers cared about you and the associates were family. Today it’s nothing but backstabbing and confusion. Managers are only out for themselves. I actually got in trouble for walking a customer to the opposite side of the store to find an item. I was told by store manager I was wasting time needed to stock. Jobs are being downgraded and lost due to machines. A lot of older people were dismissed to bring new people in who they could pay less. They said the job ended and created new names for the same job. The managers have favorites! No matter how hard you work, if you aren’t on the favorites team your work goes unrecognized. They also remove days from attendance of the friends they favored. The  managers could see the favorites walked around and talked all day and achieved no productivity and let it slide. If you are a Walmart shopper you can tell what I am saying by the way the store looks. There are some stores with good management still, but it’s rare to find. The benefits changed EVERY year! The morale is low because they won’t hire the people needed to successfully perform the tasks and it’s worse with stores that have favorites because the rest are overworked trying to keep the shelves stocked and other daily task. 9 out of 10 people are unhappy and searching for better jobs.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Dothan, AL",2/12/20,2020,2,12

Find another place to work,"The worst company I have ever worked for.  They don’t care about associates but pretend too very well.

The locals who work at this location are small towners with less than a HS education who are all toxic with bad attitudes. Everyone knows everyone else from growing up in Kenton and they all come across as being about 8 years old . It was terribly difficult trying to communicate with these people who were all more concerned with who was cheating with who and when and where while working ..

Good money...terrible managment,"Walmart is a good beginner job but after that everything starts to crumble. There are very few pros and a ton of cons. Lets start off with the Pros of Walmart; good pay, good scheduling, and good learning opportunities. Cons; management does not care, you don't get paid enough for what you  do and have to deal with, even your best isn't good enough. If your looking just to get by money wise then this is a great start. But if your looking for something more long term, keep looking.",2,Current Employee,Grocery Stocker ,"Galesburg, IL",2/12/20,2020,2,12

I tried to step up into Management after passing both leadership assessments with the highest score someone can get but, kept getting denied management positions for not having any prior management experience.

Good place to start out and a lot of room for advancement.,In my experience at Walmart I learned a few things. One is how to talk to customers and help them find what they need.

Horrible Management but a Good Work Place.,"It was nice having Walmart be my first employer, however, over time it got worse. Management do nothing to help the work place of their associates, and sit around on their phones telling people what to do without even knowing the status of what needs to be done. Most of my coworkers and Walmart associates agree that they are unfair and show horrible leadership. They couldn't care less about the associates well-being, let alone what they do as long as they aren't getting yelled at by the store owner. The personnel and management can't even take care of their point system for absences as many of the associates complain that they get points taken off for putting in their Paid Time Off (PTO). You get five absences before you get fired in the time span of 6 months. I also feel the need to explain that most of management have favorite associates, and are corrupt with favoritism.

Perks are Glorified,"Though there are many perks for working there--- employee discount, major financial help getting more college education (certifications, associate's degrees, bachelor's degrees in a variety of  programs), health and medical benefits--the perks as a whole do not outweigh the starting wage rate. For example, to get health and medical benefits after 90 days, you have to be listed as a full-time employee.  But the premiums you have to pay for the health benefits, you might as well be working part-time without the benefits to get the same amount in your paycheck.employee",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Orem, UT",2/9/20,2020,2,9

Almost exactly what you'd expect fom walmart,"Working at walmart was refreshingly NOT a nightmare at first, but that quickly changed as I got through the training. On two months of working there, my FIRST EVER job, I got saddled with running TWO departments completely alone. No other associates, no department managers. Every department was criminally understaffed and not being hired for because all they wanted was cashiers. Basically nobody working there gave a flying rat's behind about safety protocols, or really anything regarding doing their jobs well. You'd do your best, and come back the next day to see overnight undid all of that work and then some. The systems were completely useless, so every single day was a total slog of just manually trying to brute force our overstocked freezers onto the sales floor. It was a job. It was a first job. It's not a career, and it's not sustainable. It'll help you get a sense for what being employed is like, and it's something. That's the best I can say about it.",1,Former Employee,Associate ,"Lakewood, CO",2/7/20,2020,2,7

Not a bad place to work but there is obvious room for improvement,"Walmart is overall a good place to work, but the management is kind of out of touch. They’re on hand when you need them for customers, but otherwise they are scarce. The people in the electronics department really help you get used to it because it’s a lot to take in and a lot to learn. They do pay the customer service based departments a good amount but they also use everyone around the store for different tasks just to please the store manager Who demands a lot of work done with no time to do it. Coverage is usually bad and they don’t really have many closer. But depending on the people you work with daily it really makes or breaks you’re working experience.",4,Former Employee,Wireless/Electronics Sales Associate ,"Centereach, NY",2/7/20,2020,2,7

But the demanding nature of the job and the somewhat low pay was kind of demotivating. Was expected to walk/stand/lift heavy objects for very long periods of time (I worked 10 hours shifts) Breaks are frequent enough with one 15 minute every 2 hours. My biggest complaint was managements inability to pinpoint where any problems within the team were. Constantly being blamed for any of the stores shortcomings did not help improve cap 2 morale or work ethic. Other departments seem to look down upon Cap 2.

Terrible Company,"13 years as a salaried Asst Mgr.  They act like they own you and expect you act accordingly. Bad management reported to HR never addressed, scheduling changes constantly and constant swing shifts or put overnights on a store managers whim from store managers that work 40 hour weeks and want you to work 70.

I would not personally suggest this company to everyone. Lack of effective communication to employees. Management is poor and unfair at this store,There is only inclusion for certain employees. A fair amount of misplaced company asset tools to employees that have access. They are unwilling or unable to provide necessary equipment for certain employees to advance within. Management does not follow through on providing information that is pertinent to for employees or customer service. Training appears to be for certain employees,1,Current Employee,Apparel-Homelines-Jewelry ,Apparel,2/6/20,2020,2,6

Communication Among Management to Management to Associate is Limited to None,"I've worked in two locations so far the new location is far worse than the other. What really makes the work environment great is communication among everybody. With the new location, management will turn their back on you and other managers causing conflict amongst everyone. Many people within the store will selectively choose who to improve by promising and favoritism. This store will also 'antecedently' mess up peoples availabilities scheduling them when they can't show up and if the associate brings up the issue, they say that they will fix it but won't so it causes people to get occurrences, which is limited and impossible to get rid, again if brought up will be promised to get fix but won't which causes associate to get fired.",3,Current Employee,Ecommerce Department Manager ,"Rochester, MN",2/6/20,2020,2,6

For the most part Walmart is a Good place to work,I worked for Walmart for almost Six years. My experience there was good. Hard workers get promoted and become managers.

Production is all that matters.  Walmart tries to take family life into consideration but rarely does.,I enjoyed the seminars and some of the relaxing techniques.

Company is declining fast,"When I first started, it was great, but the longer I was there, more and  more changes occured. They don't train you very well or prepare you for how cruddy the job is actually going to be.

Unfortunately as a single parent of toddlers at the time, almost all the changes effected me in a negative way. The attendance policy changes, the lack of change in PTO accruence rates, and the computer system are what effectively caused me to lose my job in the end. They do not look kindly on anyone that gets sick, or their child gets sick, and have no other option but to call in. They started cutting my hours whenever I got close to being required to be signed on as full time and kept denying me the opportunity to be full time whenever I asked about the openings.

Good job but..,"While walmart is a great place to shop for things, its not always a pleasant place to work. The managers really push their employees hard, for example, an entire pallet full of chemicals such as laundry detergent, cleaning supplies, etc, oftentimes these pallets are tall, im 6 foot 3, and these pallets are almost as tall as me and managers expect that pallet to be cleared in 25 mins, which is pretty much unrealistic and would take usain bolt to do but not the rest of us non-fast human beings, and they really dont care if the employees are unhappy or in pain, one manager told me to ""man up"" when my lower back was cramping. Another told me to quit going to the bathroom to blow my nose because of allergies. They care about the customers while us associates are having a difficult time. i feel like they could offer a better pay for how theyre treating the employees. also, the HR coordinator, basically lied to me at orientation, i had applied for full time, after 3 months of working and being told i would be eligible for health insurance, so when i tried to, i wasnt eligible, i have to wait one year to get insurance, and i am in need of contact lenses and i cant see very well without new contacts, which interfered with my ability to do my job.

Management,The management of Walmart that I have worked at on 67th in Lawton Oklahoma clearly show that they have no concern for their employees or family lives they change your schedule without notice and takes four weeks just to get your availability adjusted only for them to change it 2 weeks later and then tell you that you have to refill out the paperwork and wait another month to get your schedule backas well as the point system that Walmart uses for absences and tardies because as a veteran we have many appointments but Walmart does not honor a doctor's note and sees it as you just not showing up to work.,1,Former Employee,TLE Service Technician ,"Lawton, OK",2/4/20,2020,2,4
Not very good,I worked during third shift as a dairy/cold stocker though most of the time was spent doing things that were not part of my job.

I also learned how to stock and zone products. The management was not very good. There was only one manager that really liked me.They did not answer my questions very well. The hardest thing about the job was getting things done on time. I did not zone items in the amount of they wanted me to. I was too slow.

not bad but not great,"the job wasnt the worst, pay was great, supervisors were great. the few complaints I had were they change your hours if you offer to stay or come in at times that weren't on your schedule and then tell you to change it manually and it takes 3 weeks to even change. also I was let go due to being unable to work and not being there long enough for medical leave. they have not rehired me after I've put in even 3 applications.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tilton, NH",2/3/20,2020,2,3

Not extremely difficult when focusing on yourself,"Working at here was kind of like a typical job. If you focused on you and your work it was a pretty easy to work position. A typical day would include restocking the produce, culling through the produce to get rid of any food not worthy of being sold to the customers, and arranging the stock in the back. Management was typical. They worked on rotations so every few months some would be on day shift and some would be on night shift meaning what you may need scheduling wise might be easier or harder to get worked out. The culture was easy going as long as you were about minding your own business. As long as you weren't trying to bother others you would get along with most people. The hardest part was the lack of associates in multiple sections. This would cause other sections to become short staffed as well when those sections needed help. The most enjoyable part was working with team members that understood that they were no higher up the ladder than you. Working with team members who valued teamwork helped make working a bit more fun.",4,Former Employee,Sales team and produce stocker ,"Crossroads, TX",2/3/20,2020,2,3

Customer service,Walmart was an eye opening experience for me especially with it being my first official job. Everyone was like a family and mostly everyone was close with one another.

Don't look for a future or long term,"Do not look for a future in Walmart as an associate.  Job is great for a first time post high school job but the pay and the hours are not worth it if you are looking for something long term.

Understand that anyone can be a manger,"The problem with Walmart is that anyone can be a manger. When someone leaves to be trained they come back as a robot. while policies are in place things happen that haven't been covered which forces them to believe they know the policy when they do not.

Corporate changes not benefiting employees,"I really loved working at Walmart for the first five years.  But corporate changes the past couple of years were not beneficial to employees.  Yes, they pay well...but then they cut your hours and expect more and more.  Managers listen to you, but they don’t respond.  Their hands are often tied by higher ups.  And customers often get their way even though there are policies you are expected to follow.  Again, the higher-ups tell you to follow policies and rules, then they break policy and make you bow to the customer, which makes you feel a fool.  I won’t say it’s all bad.  I really enjoy the job for the most part.  Most of the customers are decent and I have regular customers that ask for me or wait for me for service.  I’ve made many friendships with fellow workmates, as well as customers.  Benefits have changed the last couple of years, too!  And I really wish they gave you performance-based raises instead of everyone getting the same % for the most part.  I also feel that someone who has been with the company longer and is dependable and on time should be rewarded accordingly.  Seniority does not seem to make a difference at Walmart.  _x000D__x000D_All in all, I’d say Wal-Mart has made some changes of late that, in my opinion, are not the best for employees.  It’s not an awful place to work, yet...but if they continue with the changes that hurt their employees, it will not be a good place to work.",3,Current Employee,Part-time cashier/ Full-time Customer Service Associate ,"Erie, PA 16509",2/2/20,2020,2,2

Good Stopgap When Pursuing Something Else,"At my location, the hours rested between 32-37 a week, so roughly 64-72 hours a paycheck. Long days, but only three days a week, which is a plus for students or anyone working toward a greater goal in life. Co-workers on my shift were generally friendly, iffy on mid-shift but edible. Benefits plus incentives also a plus, which is another variable that intrigued me. The real, clear upside is the fact you will have four days off a week, which is golden for those I've mentioned above._x000D__x000D_As for the downside, management and HR are absolutely abysmal and they'll penalize you for failing to pull at the target percentage even on equipment that isn't designed to do so - they'll simply tell you to be more aggressive in telling those in the other department who are using the equipment (they're assigned to use different pieces of equipment in different departments). Basically, the managers won't bother in correcting certain people with rules but hold a double-standard in doing so to others. Lots of politics at my location. Lots of politics. _x000D__x000D_You will also shoulder the blame for other peoples' mistakes. For example, if someone failed to pull an empty pallet but your name comes up instead, you will receive an accountability. You're also expected to fix cherry-picked pallets even if someone else is the guilty party or it's a writeup. They're constantly changing rules, literally turning the pages while you're still on the previous page, letting you know spontaneously of different changes to the rules.

I always had enough work to fill my day when I clocked in, up until I clocked out to go home. The customers usually knew what they were looking for, but I was always ready to help someone who was seeking something they were unfamiliar with or couldn't find.

Very Tough,"From what I have experienced it is a very tough job and is hard on the body, especially to have to work under pressure pull numbers. The distribution has recently increased their pull requirement to a 100% on all orders. That means you have to move pretty rapidly in the warehouse to stay over 100% on each order you pull. That means that your body is broken down pretty heavily due to the type of work. It is hard as an older person to do this type of work. The truck departures are scheduled at certain times throughout the day so you have to move to get all your routes pulled. Some people pull faster then others but they disregard safety while doing so. I am an older male so the work is very hard on my back and body due to all the up and down on your feet and bending over and reaching above the head to pull items off shelves.",4,Current Employee,Freezer department order puller ,Distribution Center,2/2/20,2020,2,2

Not a hard job but their expectations are off the roof that it becomes difficult to work.,"The job itself is easy, the complications start when they stop scheduling properly, expecting three people to do a five man job.

Bad Store Manager. Store 5404,"When I first started I was on overnights and everything ran smoothly. i also was in school at the time so the manager on overnights was very helpful when it came to my schedule. When I moved to Cap one associate ,which is four in the morning to one in the afternoon, at that time we got a new store manager. This store manager has no respect for his coworkers. He made my whole team go out in the middle of winter while it was pouring rain, with no coats on to push carts in. It was not and has never been part of our job description. Then once we came back in soaking wet, we were sent back to frozen and dairy to finish our pallets. I do recommend  the company as a whole because they give you many benefits and are good with schedule flexibility. I do not recommend working at Home wood Illinois.

"Very chill and quiet place to work, but can be demanding if you aren't used to standing for long periods of time.","Working at Walmart can be a mixed bag. On one hand, the job itself isn't too difficult, as long as you don't mind standing and walking for long periods of time. Breaks are pretty plentiful (2x 15 min. and 1x 1 hour). Pay however is not so great. They typically start you at about 9.50 until you pass a ""certification like"" course and then increase pay to 10/hour. Seems good at first but unfortunately, you're only getting about 30 hours a week on avg. because you usually start off with a 4 days on 3 days off schedule.

They recently changed their policy to where your bonus is determined by your attendance however, employees with no occurrences only got around SEVEN dollars bonus.

Also, morale was and is horrendous. The people working there most of the time were VERY miserable, rolling their eyes at the sight of new employees, not even making eye contact because they were RACING to get their work done.

Stable company with many different jobs,"System engineer is probably like system engineer at other companies. You receive requirements, are assigned coding tasks or support tasks on an agile board, and you fulfill those tasks by code or other ways. Your project may be small or very large. Technology is usually split by what your area does. So you may be a part of Supply Chain or Store systems, etc. Those teams are grouped together as they are similar. The hardest part of the job is the red tape as a large company is very bloated. Your daily tasks may require multiple hoops to jump through to get work done. There will be constant barriers for you to be able to do your job, and with each passing year, there will be even more red tape until you want to scream. The common phrase at Walmart is going ditch to ditch. Like they will do something and that puts everyone in the metaphorical ""ditch"", then they change it and it goes into another ditch the opposite way. Walmart wants development to be agile, but prepare yourself for resistance to be able to be agile, if you ever would be. Tech at Walmart also implemented a bell curve in evaluations. This means if you had a good year, but everyone else on your team is perceived as having a better year, you will not receive a raise and will be deemed as development needed. This has created an environment of nitpicking and finding reasons not to promote, and not to give you a raise. Even if your technical skills are fantastic, your programming and code is amazing, one teeny tiny detail of your year may ruin your whole evaluation.

I tried plenty of times to move and grow in this company. I have had a CSM coach me for not assorting lollipops by color, and flavor while trying to host customers at self chef out. I have tried to use the open door policy but due to the fact that the CSM was close friends with most of the managers, I have been shunned and ignored. I have worked in departments that were the pay was a little more but I didn't get any raise. the managers that run the cap 2 team constantly fire employees and fire them for not finishing impossible work assignments. the managers will fire you out of spite and anger depending on personal issues at home or how they're feeling that day. no one is to be trusted at this store. the managers only do their jobs when their bosses visit the store any other time they sit in the back office and talk about non work related things. they do not help when its needed. when you're dealing with a serious customer issue and radio a manager their response is ""just take care of the customer"". managers will make you look ignorant  and like you don't know how to do your job when you're one following companies policy. and lastly they like to show a lot of leniancy to certain associates while - more...",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pensacola, FL",1/29/20,2020,1,29

Too much work Not enough manpower,"At first, there wasn't too much work seeing as though there were very few orders per week in our area. Now, there are not enough associates, equipment or space in the eCommerce area of our store to deal with the amount of orders we will get in a single day. Overall, good for a parttime job but get extremely stressful when management can't really help with the issues because it goes above them and the big bosses dont see our day to day issues from their desk at home office. To make matters worse, dispensers (the ending part of eCommerce) will have to load customer orders into their car regardless of weather conditions. And you will need to maintain dresscode at all times in and out of the store. So, when its below freezing outside, snowing, raining, etc. you cannot wear unapproved coats, jackets, etc. your best bet would be to go on to the walmart merch for associates and buy an eCommerce coat from there just so you won't be coached for not being in dress code.",3,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Temple, PA",1/28/20,2020,1,28

Managers are very friendly and always backing you to move up or find better opportunities for yourself. They are abundant in giving second chances to people. Meaning they give too many of them. We had one guy, he was 19 and just lazy. Unloading trucks, we would take apart 5 to 6 pallets for every 2 he'd do. Stocking shelves, he would always opt to stock the paper towels and toilet paper, but never the juices and waters.

"Easy Job, but...","I worked at Walmart for a little over a year while working a full time job because I was struggling to make ends meet. My main job title was Cashier, and during that time, there were three months where I was not scheduled AT ALL. I ended up picking up self-checkout as a secondary and once I did I was mainly scheduled at self-checkout, but I still was not getting enough hours. Then I ended up quitting my full time job and expanded my availability to all day, and that still didn't help me.

Each day you would face different things.,There main focus was Making the customers happy. They were really flexible with me and worked around my schedule. Theres room for growth. If you are a hard worker you think they dont notice but the managers notice you. The pay is okay. They want you to do more but yet you get paid the same. You can get a raise but that depends on the time you work not so much how much work you put into it. Working with customers is hard. Have to be ready to face some difficult customers.

Respect your associates,"Shareholders do not value a single employee in the company, if they did, then why give them these new ugly vests instead of decent pay raises, because to them the associates are a joke. Instead of passing something new that none of the hourly associates asked for or even want, how about taking the time to actually listen to what we want; a better MyShare percentage would be appreciated, not everyone in the company makes six figure salaries every year, and whenever the MyShare bonus is good, how about the store managers not wasting it on something stupid for the store, therefore reducing the pay out to the employees to nearly nothing, such as the remote control floor scrubbers, was it too much to actually pay people a few dollars more to do the job? Actually give employees a decent yearly pay raise, instead of a paltry 2 percent of their total pay, afraid to actually give back to your employees?",1,Former Employee,Overnight Instock Associate ,"Conover, NC",1/27/20,2020,1,27

Average across board,As an asset protection associate it is not the job you are initially told about. They just have you check receipts of almost everyone rather than actually looking out for thefts and this increases stress with customers resulting in being cursed out or people being unpleasant to you on an hourly basis. Other employees are sometimes unpleasant thinking your job is so easy but aren't paid more than them and you really want to be in almost any other position. They will tell you to do tasks that provided by management in a booklet you are told not to do. The job is pretty useless in stopping much considering if someone runs or just says no you let them pass and constant lifters know this. You basically let customers rat themselves out or irritate the good ones.,3,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Monument, CO",1/25/20,2020,1,25

Extreme Hostile Working Environment,"I worked at Walmart about 6 months, in an HR position. I've worked in HR for over 25 years and this was the most negative experience of my career. I do not recommend Walmart to anyone. It's a very hostile, good ole boy environment. It all depends on the manager you get, if they like you, you've got it made, if not look out. They definitely play favorites, and violate their own policies. They have a ton of ethical, integrity, and compliance issues. The Open Door Process is a joke; they will almost always support the store manager, NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO. Run, do not walk to any other employer. You should only go to Walmart if you have NO OTHER OPTION. I've worked in HR management for other retailers and this is the most unsupportive, hostile, negative environment that I have ever seen. My experience was so bad I won't even shop at Walmart anymore, after 30 years as a customer. They are HORRIBLE to their staff. These people deserve better, low pay, hard work, long hours, and ridiculous attendance policies, with rampant favoritism. No one has a work life balance of any kind here. Harassment flourishes here.

I'm 67 years old and just wanted to make some extra income and the store was right across the street.  I really tried hard but my body had a very hard time.  I roughly walked 8 or more miles a day in the store when I was working.  My knees were so inflamed and hurt so bad one day I told a supervisor and all she could say to me is I'm sorry this is how this job is.  I went to my orthopedic and he did see the inflammation and gave me some knee braces to wear.  They helped but my knees hurt so bad.  They expected you to get reshop from the whole story and reshop it with no TC or nothing.  So you have to walk all over the store just to find things and then you have to guess where they go.  This meant alot of walking.  I was told by several manager that we weren't allowed to use the TC's.  So how do you really do your job?  Then after 3 months of not getting a schedule (yes, I had to beg for a schedule every week), I decided to write my resignation letter and leave it at that.  I figure if they can't give me a schedule they won't miss me at all anyway. _x000D__x000D_My Mother has pancreatic cancer and who knows how long she will live.

Literally the worst job ever.,"Don't work here, especially in the deli. A typical day at work is dealing with rude customers and then having management up your a** at all times. They come bursting in the door, shouting your name, even if you are busy with a customer. The deli manager doesn't even know how to work in the deli and has to ask you how to do things. Customers will assume you are ignoring them if you are busy doing the 100 other jobs you have to do. If you close, you are at the bottom of the chain. You get to clean up after everyones mess, especially the 500 pound trash bags they leave for you. Good luck lifting that trash bag into the trash compactor (especially if you have to close by yourself, which you will have to if your coworker gets fired in the middle of their shift, or they don't show up to work because nobody really wants to work here) and having to throw away the pile of cardboard they left for you. And if someone didn't finish their job, it's O.K. because they can just leave it for the closers to finish it for them! Oh, and if you don't clean everything perfectly, you will get coached for it or worse, fired. They pick and choose who they like and if they don't like you for any reason, they will find a bull reason to fire you over. You can't work overtime to finish that job they assigned to you or you will get coached. Everything you do here has a consequence and it's either getting coached or fired. There is a clique consisting of old, bitter women who gossip about everyone (even each other) behind their backs. The enviornment is here is so toxic. It's like being in an abusive relationship. - more...",1,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Frankfort, KY",1/24/20,2020,1,24

It is a paycheck.,"Management was not concerned with worker happiness or confidence. It was a place to work, but you had to make it fun for time to go by. No passion for the customer, and more of a corporate approach than a mom and pops style like a grocery store should be. Favoritism is a very common thing and it shouldn't be. If you enjoy your job, it shows in your work, and that radiates to the customer. People prefer the smaller store as opposed to the super center down the street, because it is faster and a friendlier environment. The lower level employees are great, but not appreciated by management. Not a healthy work environment.",3,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Fresno, CA",1/23/20,2020,1,23

The job was straight forward and we had a employee game room,"Every day starts out exactly the same. During start up the managers inform us of future changes and what we all need to work on. I learned the value of the dollar, through hard work and long days. The management at walmart was constantly changing. I never felt like I truly mattered to the company however.

Fast paced,"Was a good environment at times. Little to zero motivation from management. Upper management was completely hands off and disconnected from employees, yet made decisions on said employees daily through secondhand knowledge that was never verified. You could be praised for the smallest accomplishment and in less than 24 hours be pulled in the office when you accomplished 10x more. Training is typical thrown to the wolves, unless you get a manager that cares. Company policies are enforced for some, not others, if they need a scapegoat, it's you whether management screwed up or not. You could be talked to about dress code, meanwhile 5 employees walk by with their hat on backwards. Incredibly hard to feel accomplished, rarely receive positive feedback. Almost always a backhanded compliment if any. Meanwhile you see people who don't even want to work get pats on the back for tying their shoes, 2 seconds after they return from a 45 min 15. Assistant level management was great, 90% of them were involved and paying attention. Most employees were great and are what made the job bearable. The usual drama and toxicity from a handful. Benefits and pay are above standard, though there starts to be a disparity between pay and responsibility when you promote. Little reward for insane amounts of responsibility and expectations.",2,Former Employee,Supervisor ,NY,1/23/20,2020,1,23

Great staff and co-workers who make you feel welcome.,5,Former Employee,Dairy/Frozen Associate ,"South Bend, IN",1/23/20,2020,1,23
Poor management and even worse management recruitment practices.,"There are many managers, but virtually no leaders.   Even higher level managers (Store Managers, Market Managers, Regional Managers) exhibit poor, little, or even NO leadership skills or qualities.  This is because the current recruitment  structure renders management positions most attractive to newer associates who possess the least amount of knowledge and experience.  They see the potential for much better pay and jump at the opportunity.  Those people with a greater repository of knowledge and experience recognize that the trade off of pay per hours worked isn’t balanced and therefore not worth the commitment",2,Former Employee,Associate ,Albuquerque,1/23/20,2020,1,23
They good people just have to work.,You would really have to have determination to stay there . they are really good people.

Exactly what you’d expect from a retail job,"A typical day will depend on what department you work in, but in general you will be expected put out and organize merchandise, and help customers. While I worked as a sales associate at Walmart, I learned two things: first, I learned that 90% of humanity are better people than I knew, and second, that our maintenance personnel have nerves of steel and stronger stomachs than I thought and deserve more respect. Different managers have different personalities, and how your experience with them depends on what manager you’re talking to. Some of them are level-headed and understanding, while others are more difficult to deal with. In the end, the hardest part of the job depends on what department you work in. The most enjoyable part of the job, in my opinion, is on Fridays, when they have free baked goods in the break room.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lewisville, TX",1/23/20,2020,1,23

Great co-workers offset by a corporate management system that fails.,"My experience as a Wal-Mart employee has been a mixed bag. On one hand you didn't want to fail your co-workers because your failures become someone else's work but than you have managers and an endless supply of supervisors who are inept. To be fair some of the co-managers knew what they were doing and how to get employees to perform but even they were undermined by other co-managers._x000D__x000D_  They will tell you that customers are number one and in the next breathe tell you to meet deadlines that include working while customers shop, which honestly puts the customer in the way. There were only a handful of co-managers that knew what each position, grocery cap-2 in my case, did and the other managers/supervisors treated you like you were at their beckon call at all times regardless if you had training in that department or not. You'll be told to face/zone the merchandise before you even get a chance to stock the designated area, which is completely backwards to what it should be, it's pointless work if you know anything about stocking, you are actually creating more work for yourself. I don't know if all the stores are like this or if it was just my luck but it seemed like a lot of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing and if you actually take pride in what you do, heaven help you. It's a shame that a job that shouldn't be that stressful is nothing but stress._x000D__x000D_ Side note, some of the best co-workers I have ever worked with. It seems like a necessity at times to get along because it can easily become an us vs. them environment.

"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: My Experience with Wal-mart","Depending on what shift I got, my day could start with me as the opening cashier early morning, to starting shift on self checkout. Most of the customers at this location were rude beyond belief and have a high sense of entitlement. Even if I apologize to customers for having a bad experience with someone else, they want none of it and go out of their way of making me feel terrible. The management was lackluster, and the scheduling for the up front (cashiers) was a joke. They rotated schedules without warning, leaving some of us with more than 40 hours a week with no overtime pay. The store manager would change the schedule roster and also give no notification, leaving myself to coming in ""late"" and getting docked a point for something beyond my knowledge. I tried to resolve scheduling conflicts with several managers but all they told me is that they reserved the right to do so because I signed a magic paper. The paper I signed was a scheduling agreement yes, but I agreed to the set number of hours on specific days is what I signed and nobody knows where that paper is. Despite all this, I dealt with rude customers on a daily basis as a cashier, but not all of them were rude.

manager was terrible but not a bad job for someone with no college degree,"Manager had favorites and refused to acknowledge when she was wrong. coworkers are usually good but there are bad eggs. Benefits are good for full timers at the moment but part time benefits are virtually nonexistent, this should change with the new ceo they just implemented. Turnover is very high on the low pay grades due to good people being forced to work harder than everyone else because they've been there longer and the fact that you are easily expendable and most higher positions come with mounds of stress due to their ""do more with less"" mentality in corporate. unless you are in a position that will never go away (store manager, cashier, sales associate) chances are your position probably will either be cut or downsized to save on hours the store uses/ put more money in corporate's pockets. only get a job at Walmart unless you have high ambitions in the company or you need some cash until you can get a better job.",2,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Lowville, NY",1/20/20,2020,1,20

Instead, I got the base rate of $11.00._x000D__x000D_Another thing I should note is that I saw a lot of so called ""management"" in the store doing a whole lot of nothing most of the time.

"Understaffed store, impossible demands","Store went from ~400 employees to ~160 employees in about a half year, no reduction at that time in sales volume, lost a beloved store manager of 20-ish years and his upper management team (this happened shortly before I was hired).  Management went from friendly and supportive to fear-and-punishment based, not because they were monsters but because they were desperate.  In less than two years, I worked under two store managers, two co-managers (third was starting the week I was terminated), and eight assistant managers in my direct reporting chain (none for the last month or so of employment).  _x000D__x000D_It was a tough environment.  For an entry-level employee, you do the best job you can, and that's it.  Moving up into a managerial position, you are responsible for results regardless of effort, and that was simply impossible.

Paid pennies... but at least I was happy.,"The management team was excellent and the coworkers were a pleasure to be around.  The work was moderately easy.  Stockers, just be careful not to slice your hand open with the razor blade that is used to cut boxes open.  They tried to get me into management here... Sadly, I didn't have enough management knowledge to pass the management test, and I had to leave Walmart because of health issues. The worst thing about the Lincoln, ME Walmart was the compensation.  I started at $8.60 an hour!  Now I know Lincoln, ME is in the middle of nowhere and I know it's just a stocking job, but c'mon.

Walmart was an okay place to work.,"Walmart had started off very fair and I was happy to have been employed there, but the wages were less than what was deserved, as I had to complete three different peoples jobs including my own every day.

"Low pay, but a good culture","As a personal shopper (and, when time allows, a shelf stocker) in a Neighborhood Market, the work is very physical and exhausting, but not unreasonable. Management is good and they work as hard as the rest of us. The pay ($11.50) is lower than Target's $13, but Target (and most retail stores) doesn't offer any full-time entry level positions and I was able to get full-time at Walmart. The health insurance premiums are lower than expected, but all the available options have high deductibles ($2,700 to $3,000). Paid time off is reasonable. Overall, I like the job and the people I work with, but the low pay keeps me looking for new employment.",4,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Topeka, KS",1/17/20,2020,1,17

Working for Walmart is Interesting,"When I worked at Walmart my hours and days were inconsistent. I was a full time associate, so I was there all day and almost everyday. Sometimes I would work seven to ten days straight with one day off after, sometimes two days off. Management was great when I first started, but they suck now. I made a lot of great friends, I knew almost everyone in the store. I worked in almost every department.

Dont do it if you need full time hours,"Was promised 40 hrs a week, not once have i gotten that.

It’s ok I guess it’s a job,I guess it’s ok they don’t follow the 10 feet rule far as managers goes co manager and all it’s a lot of favoritism but I guess it with every job they expect the workers that they knw gonna get the job done to do so much,3,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Grand Prairie, TX",1/17/20,2020,1,17
not a great place to work,"management does not care for employees, no benefits unless you are full time which is almost impossible unless you are a manager, they work you to the bone and it still wont be good enough.. no matter how hard you work your butt off, management abuses power, lots of favoritism towards male employees especially in the back,hardest  part about working here is trying to keep up with managements ridiculous standards. The best part of working here is the breaks... you get two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch. you only get 5 points for attendance within a 6 month period and from the date of your first point after 6 months it rolls off. Supposedly, Walmart employees make an average of $14 an hour but at my store, we are getting paid $11. Heard a rumor that the reason we were not getting that pay was because of new vests. After we received these new vests (which were NOT worth it by the way) we were told that the new pay was postponed. This job is not worth it.",2,Current Employee,Cap 2 associate/Apparel processor ,"Mesquite, TX",1/17/20,2020,1,17

One big family,"Walmart is the type of place you end up wanting to keep working just to get to see the folks you work with on a regular basis. There really isn't a job within the company that's ""hard,"" but that doesn't mean you don't need to be dedicated to work there. There is a place for almost everyone within the company. The hardest part of working there is dealing with customers who treat you poorly just because you work there. Having a customer tell you how wonderful it is to have someone like you helping them, and especially when they say it in a survey, is really rewarding. This is one of the few companies that pays decently, allows you to work the hours you want and request days off, provides benefits, and dress how you feel most comfortable (within reason.)",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Shelbyville, IL",1/17/20,2020,1,17

Challenging and demanding,"A typical work day was 10 hours.  I usually did about 500 prescriptions a day, and we had good pharmacist overlap.  The fact that we have cashiers and techs at Walmart made it a lot easier to stay focused on pharmacist work.  The phones were incessant at my store, but we didn't have a drive-thru and thus has a little less distraction.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my patients.  The most difficult part of my job was meeting my bosses very short deadlines.  I was typically only given 1-2 days to throw together an off-site event or to meet my bosses demands and held to the highest levels of accountability for my and my teams' failures.  We would also be given new computer based learning (CBL)/training and told we were already late on them before they even dropped for us to complete.  I also was required to be on multiple conference calls every week, including weeks when I am on paid time off (PTO)/leave.  The pay was excellent, but I don't think they offer anywhere near what I was offered 5 years ago, and the benefits keep getting worse and worse.

Management absolutely does NOT care about any of their employees, unless you somehow become a “favorite”. In that case you can get away with anything. I heard many members of management talking so unprofessionally and rudely about their workers that it almost made my ears bleed. If you get sick you have to file for a medical leave. If you haven’t worked there for a year, it will get denied and you will get fired. Even if you have worked there for a year, unless you were at deaths door, it will probably be denied and you will be fired. If you have an emergency and leave work, you will be fired. If you get a “warning” 3 times, you get fired. (These earnings are often things such as “hey you’re getting coached because you forgot to pick up a piece of cardboard.”) Yup, 3 warnings like that and you’re gone. If you need emergency time off for a funeral, you’re probably getting fired. Just don’t do it.

I've tried to work at the money center , Walmart .com counter, and a CSM position trying to get promoted and learn more and was passed up and a lot of politics  going on always amongst employees . The environment was toxics at times.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Knoxville, TN",1/11/20,2020,1,11
Not a good place for job/life balance.,Too many changes and not enough training. Managers had their favorites and associates would go from manager to manager to find someone to give into them. Upper management would seem to pick on certain people over others.,2,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"San Antonio, TX",1/11/20,2020,1,11
Worst job I’ve ever had.,"I hated working for Walmart. I worked there for about 5-6 months. The workload was way too much for one person to handle, your management never supports you, you’re always talked down to, the pay is awful for the work you’re asked to do, and the work-life balance was a joke. Don’t ever consider working here if you value your mental health because, take it from me - this place will drain you. Management plays favorites and if you don’t do every little thing they ask, you’re viewed as the black sheep and will be treated as such. I was promised $11/hr. full-time, but only got paid $9/hr. with 20-25 hr. weeks. But it was still a job, so I took it anyway seeing as I was told within two months, I could move someplace else in the store and make more money that required full-time hours, which was a LIE. I was a lot attendant, so I had to help keep the lot clear of carts (with teammates) and assist customers with carry-outs. Any time your manager needed you to do a carry-out, they would try to reach you on your walkie-talkie but wouldn’t refer to you as your name, but as “stockman”, which used to infuriate me to no end, but whatever. There were no benefits, even though I was told I would receive it. All in all, Walmart is a very dishonest company who should value their employees more and find better management who weren’t racist scumbags. Don’t work here. Don’t work at the Cortland, Ohio Walmart. Trust me.",1,Former Employee,Lot Associate/Customer Service ,"Cortland, OH",1/11/20,2020,1,11

You need to work hard,I don’t have much to say. If you like it or not will depends on who’s on your team or who’s your manager. But my experience is that it wasn’t organized enough in the back to do my job faster but if you work hard enough you can get stuff done on time,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Callaway, FL",1/11/20,2020,1,11
