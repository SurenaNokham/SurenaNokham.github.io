"Decent wage, but at what cost?","A typical day at work for me.is usually crazy, There is a lot of getting pulled in many directions.

I enjoy my job immensely. The job itself. I have learned how to merchandise to draw customers in. I have learned to deal calmly with irate customers, keeping track of inventory, problem solving, working in groups as well as working solo.Management: Where do I begin? There are way too many managers in the store. And they all have different ideas as to how everyday should be handled, and different ways they want things done. Which is fine, if there weren't so many of them. It causes a lot of confusion and a lot of work being re-done. There is also a lot of tension, because of this. These are the salaried managers. My bosses. What's worse is that, even the same manager will change the rules repeatedly. It creates a situation where, no matter what you do, it's wrong. It's frustrating, when you just want to do the job the right way the first time, and to be appreciated for doing the work.Also, withing the current management team, there are several who seek to constantly create drama that isn't necessary. Even if it means that they will lie point blank to your face. Then lie again, when it comes out later. All in all, I think a restructure is in need where the number of salaried managers is concerned.

Productive,"A typical day at Walmart would be me coming into work and unloading the meat/produce truck. I would pull the whole truck with a manual forklift and place them into coolers.

Intresting work environment,"Regular days tend to be a little slow. I've learned that you must be extremely patient with certain customers. The management at Walmart can be a little rough sometimes, but someone is always there to answer any questions or concerns you may have. The hardest part of my job would be getting customers to realize that we are just retail sellers of the cellular carriers we provide and not the actual corporate stores. Last but not least, I enjoy helping the customers the most. Some are elderly and don't quite understand how the electronics work that they purchase.

I learned how to use a cash register, but more importantly, I learned I am good at working with people. I didn't associate with the managers very often. My co-workers were all very different types of people. I got along with all of them and never had any arguments or disputes. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, but that didn't happen very often.

Inconsistent Management leads to low moral among employees,"A lack of employees, and a refusal by management to undo a hiring freeze has led to employees of Walmart to pull more of their fair share. According to Walmart's own system, I successfully completed 13 hours of work. This is not a rare occurrence, however, according to management the program, MyGuide, is flawed; however, never in the favor of the employee.This has to a revolving door of employees, few of which, when a rare new hire is made, last more than two weeks.I have applied for advancement within the company, to management, with the vacancy expected to be filled soon. However I am not looking to stay with Walmart.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Geneseo, NY",2/25/13,2013,2,25

I wouldn't encourage my kids to work there,"A typical day at work starts with sliding your badge through the time clock. Heading out to the sales floor to get keys you notice how much was left undone by the overnight crew. Having 8 hours to stock all the merchandise that came in the truck the night before, help customers and sell electronics results in a busy but manageable day...until management get's involved. Suddenly the department is left unattended so that homelines can get stocked or have it's modulars redone, because homeline associates can't do this on their own. I'm all about one team one fight, but it should really work both ways.Pay is fairly low, but it will pay bills if not much else. Benifits are ok if you are single, but if you have a family don't try to work here unless they can guarantee a full-time position, which they wont.

"great job, stressful environment","This was by far my favorite job. i got to learn and do many jobs within the year i worked for this company. i was taught to work different departments throughout the store. management was overall nice, but everyone is human. the only thing i did not like was the fact that you have about 5 plus managers over you and they don't communicate well with eachother. if one tell you to do something and another tell you to do something else, you follow the highest ranking but it the same rank tells you to do something its difficult to distinguish which task to do first considering they both can take you're job and they don't communicate well. My coworkers and i became family so i loved this job. i get along with everyone where ever i go. and the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with the customers and help them find the merchandise they needed.",4,Former Employee,"Toy sales associate, cashier, and produce ","Warner Robins, GA",2/23/13,2013,2,23
Everyday is cetainly a NEW day!!!!!,"We have 2 to 3 meetings a day, do a tour of the store, make notes of any changes that could be made to produce more sales, delegate out the task created from the tour and follow up throughout the day, help when needed, answer questions, etc. My co-workers are very dedicated and work very hard to complete any task given. Customer Service always comes first, as it should in any retail store. Working in Walmart store is a learning experience everyday no matter how long you have worked there. There will always be something or someone new that comes along with a different and/or easier way of doing things, rather it is operations or merchandising. With there being so many departments and so much merchandise and so many people, every day certainly a new day, making it both a little hard to get use to yet fun and exciting.",4,Current Employee,Fashion Zone Manager ,"Garden City, SC",2/23/13,2013,2,23

"Fun, and taught me a how a real corporation works","typical work day consisted of partaking in just about every job in the store while I was there because I was the only hourly employee that was cross trained for every department except apparel and jewelry.I learned that no matter what you have to do you must always give it your best because if you do not then someone will be unhappy and it will come back on you. So I try to keep everyone I meet happy.My Ast. Managers where the best, they worked just as hard as the rest of the hourly employees and where not afraid to get down to the nitty gritty with us. My real manger however never worked with us and was unliked my very many of our employees.My co-workers where every enjoyable to work with and even the ones that I know didnt work every well, if they worked with me it seemed like they would always pick of the pace a little bit because of my upbeat attitude.The hardest part of the job in the beginning was trying to learn all the different departments at once that was I could be which ever one the needed me to be whenever I could be it.The most enjoyable part of the job, was actually the hardest. It made me very happy that it was know that I could and was capable of being able handle all of the stress and have the mental capability to be able to accomplish this",3,Former Employee,cashier and sales associate ,"Paris, AR",2/23/13,2013,2,23

Love the people I work with,"I am now a wireless sales associate and so I deal with contracts, contract phones, and prepaid phones on a daily basis. Anyone that has any questions about plans, phones, or even accessories, come to me to help them find what they want. I have learned that customers don't want to be forced into anything, so I have given them all sorts of options to choose from so they are more comfortable. Management respects what I do and normally look to me for answers or contract concerns and I'm always willing to help them and the customer(s). Besides me, there is only one other person who works in the same area and between the two of us, we know what we're doing and he's always been easy to work with and I've had no problems with him or anyone else. My co-workers are some of the easiest to get along with and I like working with them. The hardest part of my job can be trying to get a hold of a carrier during a contract depending on how long it takes to get someone or how impatient customers can be if it does take awhile, but I get the job done anyway, no matter how difficult. Lastly, what I enjoy most about my job is the very end of any contract when I activate the phone(s) for the customer(s). The smiles on their faces and any compliments, let me know that I have done my job. I also love how many new phones I get to learn about and am able to teach all my customers how they work.",4,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Springfield, OH",2/22/13,2013,2,22

"Customer service. Helping others, cell phone sales","A typical day at work. I arrive in the mornings at 8:30 am or 7:00 amIf at 8:30 that usually means that I am to open up the photo lab for business, and the connection center. First I would go and get my money for the two cash registers for those departments. I have to go to the CSM podium to get my money bags and then I would return to my department to open the cash registers. After this I would go to my managers office and get the keys to the photo lab and to the connection center safe, I would then go to the photo machines and reboot the kiosks, there are 4 of them. I would then check to see if any maintenance needs to be done on the photo machine in the lab. If not I would start up the photo-lab machine so that orders for the day can start printing, If there are already orders being processed I would prepare the envelopes for the orders so that they are ready when the printing is complete.In the connection center I would first check my inventory for the day, and make sure that the sales reports from the previous day have been filed correctly. I would then check for any messages from our service reps through AT&T. All the while serving customers in a timely and efficient manner, If I have a customer I would usually do a credit check on them, or process an order for a new line or upgrade. We have a interface that allows us to do this through the service providers, All I have to do is enter Imei and sim card information and maybe make a call to the service provider. Then I finalize the contracts with signatures from the customer and make the sale through the cash register, - more...",3,Current Employee,Connection center/Electronics/Photo lab ,"Shelbyville, KY",2/22/13,2013,2,22

Gone downhill,"I've been with Walmart for almost 8 years, it seems to be a completely different company now than it was 8 years ago. There is less management now therefore the managers that are there are stressed out and attempting to do the work of 3 people with very little help on the sales floor simply because there are not enough hours available to have that many sales floor associates. The sales associates who are there are usually on up on the registers because there are not enough cashiers scheduled. The store manager does not delegate to his other managers then gets angry when things don't get done. A set schedule? HA! don't even think about it. Overall I would not recommend working for Walmart unless you like to be stressed out, yelled at by customers and managers, and a irregular schedule.",2,Current Employee,personnel ,CO,2/21/13,2013,2,21

"Steady hours, but at what cost?","Working at Walmart is not as easy as people think. Now, the job duties were not difficult at all, but dealing with the overpaid managers was mentally taxing. Many of them are complete morons, and would actually turn to ME, a lowly cashier, for help or questions regarding store policies and procedures. That is when they were even available, as they would walk around the store texting during the vast majority of their shifts, barely even looking up to clock out for the day. However, my main reason for leaving was that they would not work around my class schedule, which I gave them copies of on three separate occasions.

An alright place to work if you work hard and can afford to wait to advance.,"A typical day at work, at least in the electronics department, consists of helping customers with their day to day needs. We will restock the returns for that morning and day. We stock the movies for the day, and while tracing the department and helping customers and stocking merchandise we tidy the department and make sure all the merchandise is in the right spots.I have learned a lot in my time thus far while employed by Walmart. I have learned about all the new technologies available, Walmart has allowed me to mold myself into a customer satisfaction based and very efficient employee. I have learned how to run the photo lab and the importance of accurate inventory and proper stocking, and how following standard operating procedures can keep the whole retail operation running smoothly.Management at my store are very understanding and work with you to help you become a better employee instead of pointing out your flaws. My only complaint with it is the ever changing ways of doing a task and every manager not being on the same page as to how they want it to be done; coupled with a specific manager who likes to pull you to a different area of the store then you are scheduled to work and changing your current tasks every 15 minutes to half hour, when the first tasks given take an hour or more to complete, leaving you with many unfinished tasks.My specific co-workers in store are very nice and work hard along side me to make us a productive team, for the most part.

Used to be a fun place to work,"My typical day at work consists of first clocking into the system and heading to the Management office to sign out my keys. Most of the time I have a wait of 2 minutes to 20 minutes depending on where Management is at the time they were called. From there I would go up front to the wireless store where I would count down the money in the registers, turn on the computer's, and perform out daily audits and put away any freight that came in from the previous nights truck.From there I would open the store and proceed with helping customer's through out the day with either choosing a new cell phone or getting service through their current cell phone as well as providing technical support on how to operate the phone and/or fix any problems that arise.During my time working here I have learned quite a bit about how cell phones operate, as well as the in's and out's of cell phone contracts.I won't say much about the management team currently at out store but unprofessional is one of the words I would easily use. Most of them do dress professionally but actions speak louder than words. There have been several occasions where associates would be coached due to not getting their job done correctly and efficiently but management needed to provide instruction that was never given, or halfway through the project they would change what was going on. Beyond that I enjoyed working with my of my co-workers. If it wasn't for them there would have been several times I would have walked out and quit.",3,Current Employee,Wireless Sales Associate ,"Marshalltown, IA",2/20/13,2013,2,20

"flexible schedule, terrible work environment","I liked my flexible work schedule, but management sucked. They assign too many tasks on each associate, they will not hire enough people, so you are doing double and even triple the work for multiple departments. I understand no matter where you go there are always going to be terrible customers, but these customers have no soul. They treat you like dirt and practically spit in your face because of the management. In example, they never have enough registers open, so management will pull you from your department and put you on a register then when they page for customer assistance to your department, you immediately get yelled at and cursed for their waiting. The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers, we all just learned to work together and laugh everything off.

At the University of Southern Mississippi, I was and is still able to gain a lot more insight about the retail industry and all of the operations involved in it. I have also learned the challenging roles that managers take on a daily basis such as operational managing direct material, labor, and overhead. My co-workers also taught me a lot about associates in general like what to expect from people as it relates to the betterment of the business overall mission. I would say that the hardest part about my job was the direct physical labor of associated with it. At times, it was extremely tough unloading two or three trucks everyday. However, as I began to learn more about business at USM, I learned that our labor was play a major role in Wal-Mart's productivity rate.

So i proceeded to tell him I would not be in on that following thursday and friday. He told me that I would need a doctors note. I told him no problem I'll have it to you tomarrow. He then decided to change my hours. I think that he really thought I couldn't get a doctors note so then he could fire me. All the pregnant women I know that has worked there or still does work there, they are giving them problems also.

Demanding and Unorganized,"Even though being a cashier is one of the easiest jobs in America, it isn't so at the Walmart I work. I don't know about other stores but my facility is chaotic and poorly managed. Walmart has so many policies that are there to protect the associates, but they are hardly practiced within my store. Instead of working together to run the business the six assistant managers there each do their own thing and more often than not end up contradicting each other which stresses and confuses the people working under them. It's frustrating to have someone tell you do something and then another comes and tells you to do the opposite and just keeps going on like a power struggle. As a cashier I'm supposed to be up front at the registers but most nights I'm stuck in the freezer section of the store stocking two departments worth of merchandise and being pressured to get it done within an 8-hour shift as well as rotating the products and zoning ALL BY MYSELF! The worst part of it is that they force you to do work you're not supposed to do without proper training and reprimand you when it's not finished or done how they want it, then lie when asked questions about compensation and job description but quick to coach or write you up on something trivial. Bottomline is I do not enjoy working at that specific Walmart and abhor the company altogether.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Stocker ,"Boynton Beach, FL",2/16/13,2013,2,16
the workplace called walmart,walmart is a place to where the work principles are abit......different and they tend to do only what you let them do which can determine alot of factors from job security to how management treats you to your values of the entire business. its not 1 of the best places to work but it is 1 of the best places to go if your on your last leg.,3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cordova, TN",2/16/13,2013,2,16

A perfect job for a hard worker.,"After I clock in, I immediately head for the loading docks if a truck came to be unloaded, otherwise i seek out guidance from an assistant manager on what today's tasks are. If there is a truck, I start hooking up the roller line the loos freight come out on. We then divide the workload into 4 sections, balancing the load. Once the loose freight is off, we move the roller line out of the truck and grab pallet jacks to get the pallet freight off the truck. Once done, the mixed freight boxes are sorted and placed on their designated pallets. At 8:00 PM, we go on our hour lunch. At 9:00 PM, we take the freight to their departments on the sales floor. We then proceed to pick merchandise out of the back stock, then deliver it to their departments. Once done, one member writes up any broken merchandise that came on the truck, while the other members sweep the back room. I learned how to follow orders when given, organization skills and proper handling of hazardous material situations. Management constantly pushes you to get the truck done in a faster time than the last, regardless of truck size. My co-workers are dedicated to helping each other shoulder the load. The hardest part of the job for me is writing up the damaged goods. The most enjoyable part of my job is unloading the truck. I enjoyed working for this company.",4,Former Employee,2nd Shift ICS ,"Logansport, IN",2/16/13,2013,2,16

I cleaned up after my shift and prepped for the next work day. I learned how to increase my productivity without losing the quality of our products. Management provided me with the proper tools to succeed and encouraged feedback. My co-workers supported me when necessary and we all worked in team environment. The hardest part of the job were our seasonal donuts. However, I learned to adapt quickly and overcame adversity. I enjoyed our safe work environment and promoted safety.",4,Former Employee,Baker ,"Iron Mountain, MI",2/16/13,2013,2,16
Good Job with great co workers. Productive workplace,"Wal Mart is a great place to work if one is into the retail business. I started at Wal Mart because I needed a job a couple years ago but it is not something that I see myself doing for a long time. I am apart of the overnight shift so it is hard for me to function during the daytime because most of the time I am tired from the night before. A typical day at work is getting to work around 10pm and getting my task sheet from my manager with all the task that have to be done by the time I leave. For example, If I am stocking in the food area, I will have a task to stock a certain food group within the time that was given to me on my task sheet. When I complete that task, I have to go to a computer and confirm that I completed my task and I can now move on to the next one. That goes on for the entire shift until all tasks are completed. My co-workers are great. They like to keep a fun atmosphere at work while working and it helps all of us because some nights can be tough but having great co-workers around you makes the night that much better and the job much better. Wal Mart Management is good at what they do. If I have any questions, they are open to listen to what I have to say as well as if I have any suggestions that can help the company in any way. There really isn't a hard part to the job except for staying alert because the job is during overnight hours and you never truly get used to those hours. I have learned that you can work your way up in Wal Mart. I have learned that making an effort is important and being too comfortable with a situation will not get you to where - more...",3,Current Employee,Maintenance Associate/Stocker ,"Eldersburg, MD",2/16/13,2013,2,16

Pretty bad at some locations.,"My particular Wal-Mart had major problems with the quality of it's people at all levels. Most employees would pride themselves for being high/drunk/or gang affiliated while at work. Management turned a blind eye to all of this and basically took a ""see no evil"" approach to it.I was promoted without even putting my name into the hat into a position that by all accounts was impossible to complete. I accepted the position without knowing what I was getting into and soon found myself being scapegoated for other manager's oversights.From what I understood, each store is very different from one another and the one I worked at was just about the worst.",1,Former Employee,Inventory Supervisor/Unloader ,"Columbus, OH",2/16/13,2013,2,16
Mixed experience,"My experience with walmart is fairly mixed across the board.I found that i was always on the same time each day everyday regardless of what was needed,The department was knowingly understaffed in a department that usually has eight.There was at the highest only three people including the department manager for the department meaning the extra work was passed onwards.I had one direct manager over the department above the department manager being one of six assistant managers,two co managers and then the store manager himself.This would lead to some miscommunication on problem's when my direct manager was unavailable.Due to understaffing of different area's of the store itself,more than one department would be staffed with one person being at the most i watched three departments at any time.The compensation and rate of performance review's were very good but I felt underappreciated always,Mostly getting praise from other assistant manager's or both co-managers just not my own manager with my work.The reason for my departure was never clarified by management with the store and corporate itself when they were suppose to contact me and help resolve the issue,sadly nothing was done for me despite my follow ups.",3,Former Employee,Customer service representative ,"Leland, NC",2/16/13,2013,2,16

Love my co-workers and I miss them dearly. We all got along very well. I miss organizing our monthly potlucks and celebrating co-workers birthdays.

I love everyone I work with, that is going to be the harder part of leaving. The hardest part of the job.... is mostly the lack of communication within management and there is no balance with your life and work. One manager will tell you one thing, another will tell you something completely different, its very confusing! If you have a family, you can forget seeing them! I work every holiday until late at night, with a child, this is hard and it causes a feud!! I don't get to see my child like I should, and it is harder to get her to her appointments because my schedule is always different! I also don't agree with how the work ethics are done.

Fine place to work for,"I've worked at Wal-Mart for nearly three years, one year as a cashier and the last year and 3/4 at the jewelry counter.Our days normally goes as follows:In the morning we go over our inventory logs and ensure that the numbers are correct, and then in the afternoon we log in freight and place them in the cases or out of the floor and then the one who closes is to ensure nothing is on the floor and that all cases and keys are locked up. In between these jobs we take care of the customers who come to use either with seeing an item, fixing watches, sizing items or just helping them find something in the store.Our management at the store, depending on what level, doesn't have much interaction with us on a daily basis, and when interacting with them at times they let it be known that you're keeping them from doing other things in the store. However not all are like that, there are a few who will take the time to talk and let you know that they care about what you have to say.My co-workers at the store are a group of some awesome people, we're essentially a family when we're at work, we try to help one another with coverage and helping when mods for our departments come down. We band together when one of us needs help and will either have 'jean days' to donate money to them or even bake sales as well as going out to their house and helping out.I believe the hardest part of the job is when they only schedule two people for the who day, one in the morning and the other at night.

In the fresh areas, there is always a lot to be done. There is a lot of helping customers find various items, as well as handling complaints. As a cake decorator you deal with a lot of very kind and also very terrible people. During the holidays there is a lot of pressure to make sure everything is full. Sadly a lot of the time that is not possible due to order errors or in many cases just a lack of help in general. There is a lot of cleaning to be done.

I'm now much more serious about finding a job, doing my job, and doing it right.Management was good, they kept an eye on things pretty well.Co-workers were nice, all about having this family at work. I didn't feel like I really fit into the family though, so a lot of things were awkward, and had my sexuality mocked on an occasion.Hardest part of the job was just the fact that I wasn't taking it seriously, so I wasn't doing well, and that hurt.Most enjoyable part of the job was just getting paid. I spent pretty much my entire life in the store in the time that I worked there, so I didn't really have much to do outside, but when I did get paid, it was time to go buy an ice cream and snack on it during lunch.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Layton, UT",2/10/13,2013,2,10

Wal-Mart is thre biggest company in the world because the foundation is solid,"I really enjoyed the job and the people as most everyone tried to achieve company goals and targets and on a consistent basis we did. I worked at night as the Overnight Asst. Mgr and it was my responsibility to run the entire operation of the store from 7:30pm-8am. That entailed most importantly that we were delivering customer service at a high level 100% of the time and that production was met by each and every associate. Teaching and training were nightly things I enjoyed doing as I got to see associates grow and reach their capabilities. "" Inspect what I expect,"" "" Trust but verify"" are my words to live by as I would give positive feed back to those who did well and reteach and retrain and possibly coach those who did not perform to company standards. What I learned is that even though the concept is the same for all retail stores meaning the bottom line is to make money, grow the business, give unbelievable world class customer service, retain our associates to name a few the way getting their can sometimes be different. What I mean is as I use this as an analogy. The same goal of reaching the Super Bowl is the same for all 32 football teams as well as scoring more points than the other team is the goal that will help you reach your ultimate goal. The difference is all 32 teams have different play books for play calling as well as players codes of conduct to name a few.

There are some that get by with not doing much which doubles my work load, but it's up to management to figure that out.

Graveyard Shift,"No other phrase seems to fit this job better than this. Daily I would have to wake up at 8 pm and get ready for my shift that started at 10. After reaching the store I would be greeted with the all smiling, yet tired faces of my coworkers who, while either much older than me, still acted as if they were in highschool with all of the drama that entails. Management was at best helpful and on task, and at worst it seemed as if asking them to do anything for their subordinates was arm twistingly painful. The produce night shift was monotonous and repetitive, there was almost no change to what we had to do, and while that was nice it became boring after a while. I did learn a lot about the upkeep of produce and the difference between a ripe and overripe fruit. The most difficult part of the job was pulling down freight, at 2 a.m. during our lunch break at freight truck would come in stacked to the ceiling with produce products, and since I was never properly trained in the usage of electric pallet jacks, I had to use a hand drawn one and pull them down. The best part of the job was working the salad wall, they would come in these lightweight boxes and all I'd have to do was check the dates and toss the bad ones then restock with newer ones.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Produce Stocker ,"Orlando, FL",2/8/13,2013,2,8

Walmart is Walmart,"My experience at Wal-mart was mostly fun except for the last month or so, seeked medical attention for anxiety and sleeplessness. I have met co-workers that would most likely stand infront of a bullet to protect a stranger. I have also met a few that would step over a stranger to protect a bonus check.

Very stressful,"The Wal-Mart management team is rude and one of the worst places I have ever worked. I don't know how they get away with being so mean. People are worked to death for such little pay. We are consistently told not to have overtime, but wait, you can't leave until you're done. If you get overtime, you have to shave it off during your lunch hour. There are times I have to take a 3 hour lunch. If you work overnight, you are made to sit in the breakroom for an hour or more and then you are allowed to punch in, You're asked to work overtime and promised your time card will be fixed, however, when you approach the mgr to fix it, he says, ""oh, you have to shave it off your lunch"". It's insane. The Wal-Mart I work at constantly have employees walk off the job or they just plain old don't show up, Two days in a row now, the morning cashiers haven't shown up!!!

Company has really lost sight of what's important!!,"Wal-mart can be a great company to work for if more managers and corporate employees were to get more involved and see what goes on in day-to-day operations such as cashiering and assisting customers.

The management is a D- at my store all they care about is their pay and how many sales they can make all the while being understaffed and paying less.There are never enough cashiers and sales associate at work, which in turn we have longer lines, over worked employees and unhappy customers especially those who need assistance in different areas or when purchasing large items.

"training, and moving forward with Wal-Mart","I have learned that in all jobs it a best practice to always try to do your best at what you do. The trick to it all is gathering the training you need to succeed. I do not have negative things to say about Wal-Mart, In-fact its quite to the contrary. You see Wal-Mart has been a great place to work for me. Since I started to work there I have gained many new skills that might have passed me up. A large portion of this has to do with the training I gained from Wal-Mart. How ever It is in my opinion that the area Wal-Mart needs to improve on is advancement of their Associates. The associates that go above and beyond and strive to learn and move forward... These are the associates I am talking about. You see Wal-Mart has not given me any opportunity to grow. I received great annual reviews, in fact my last review was rated as a person who exceeds their expectations. I just feel I'm being over looked and want to advance my career in the field I have chosen. Security is my life and its what I do.

Horrible place to work,The company was a fun place to work 7 years ago when I first started there.

I like my job but feel unappriciated. My areas are not easy. I give 100% of myself and so do my dept managers.

needs work,Some managers will bust their behinds to help associates and then you've got the ones who won't bust a grape just hand out orders. The same goes for associates as well. Some are really helpful and others shouldn't even get a check.! Why is it that the hardworkers can't get ahead? The floaters if you will. The ones that do many things throught the whole store. Why aren't they offered full time and benefit packages? you want them to work like they're full time employees but don't want to compensate. I personally think Mr. Walton has turned over in his grave multiple times from watching how hs buisness has been run how hiis employees are treated especially. He was a family man and his employees were like family. This new generation Wal mart is everything but family.

I have learned that this job does have its perks, helping people, seeing the smiles on their faces makes me TRULY happy and delighted that even though i told this person where a jar of mayo was after searching the store for 30 minutes that she can go home and cook a meal for her family and doing something so small for someone can change if not put their day back on track and every time that happens i feel better about myself. Management is decently strict which is something every place needs, they have a lot on their plate and while their always busy they do help with your problems and questions. Even if they are busy they will sometimes if not always try to at least talk to you about something bothering you or affecting your work schedule. My co-workers are as different as the different colors in a rainbow. Some are nice and some are difficult to handle and deal with, teamwork is something i love to be involved in and something i feel necessary especially in retail i ALWAYS find myself asking someone else who knows more about if a product is gluten free or where exactly moisturizing cream is.

Busy place to work but a fun place to associate with customers/co workers,I work overnights from 10pm til 7am stocking freight throughout the store. I learn how to use people skills and use good customer service. The management is strict but they want things to be done right just like any other. Co-workers are pretty cool because it is a diverse environment. The hardest part of the job is getting the store stocked and zone before you depart. The most enjoyable part of the job is associating with your co-workers and enjoying being at the job.,3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Richardson, TX",1/30/13,2013,1,30

Exciting at times and had a lot of freedom.,"I spent about 3 years with Walmart in Loss Prevention. After being there for awhile I began to train other people to do Loss Prevention. I also traveled throughout the district and worked in other stores. It is very boring at times, but at any given moment there could be a ton of excitement. I don't know what it is, but catching someone shoplifting just gets your blood pumping. It was all undercover so I dressed like I do when I am not at work. Overall Walmart is not a bad company. I have a good friend who has disabilities that works there. She would not be able to work anywhere else because of her condition. I praise them for giving people with developmental Disabilities a chance to be part of our working society. A lot of people knock Walmart because it isn't what it used to be, but everything changes. Though I don't work there anymore I do still remember some of the fun times I had there. They got an overall rating of 3 because they do need to work on a few things, but I learned a lot from this company.",3,Former Employee,Safety team member ,"Morton, IL",1/30/13,2013,1,30

Was a enjoyable job to meet and see people I had become fond of has what made the job pleasant,"On a typical day at Wal-Mart at least at the store I was fortunate to be employed, I along with most other of the employees knew what their jobs were and knew what to do to get them done. Almost everyday I had learned something new or was willing to learn new objectives by my fellow employees which made it such a ""team"" around there. Management was kind but again for us who had worked the shift I worked, management was helpful when needed but knew we would get the job done no matter how jobs they gave us. Everyday was hard work and we all were given many responsibly but did what we could to get them done and always asked or assisted each other to get them done before our shift ended. Over the 6 years working for Wal-Mart I worked in a few various positions but as for my last as a receiving manager was where I felt most at home. Due to meeting all the new vendors and the constant multitasking which kept me busy all day and excepting something new to occur every time I walked in always kept me on my toes. What I have learned most from working at Wal-Mart has been what it takes to operate a day to day operation of just one of hundreds of retail stores.",2,Former Employee,Warehouse/Receiving Supervisor ,"Highland, IL",1/30/13,2013,1,30

Unprofessional,"At work it was confusing, figuring out what was expected of you for the day because the people over me were not on the same page so I was being misguided on multiple occassions. I learned a lot about myself, for example I've always considered myself a patient person but working there I found that there is more to my patience than I thought. My co-workers were amazing. We worked well together & made the best of things. Though, I would have to say that the hardest part of the job was pleasing the management. It would've been easier if they all expected the same thing from us. But the most enjoyable part of my experience was meeting all the new people.

Great environment and amazing people to work with.,Wal Mart to me so far has been a fun place to work but in my opinion the work that an individual puts into their department is not shown in the compensation received. The management team at my store is great and very understandable about time needed off among other things. The largest problem that I have with my current job is the compensation.,3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Du Quoin, IL",1/30/13,2013,1,30

Great Place to Grow,"A Typical day in my position involves managing employees so they and our customers got the best experience possible. I continue to grow my relationships with both and enjoy doing so. I spend a lot of time problem solving, which is a guilty pleasure. I love the satisfaction of facing an issue head on and over coming it. I learned a lot of techniques and gained a lot of patience while working with this company. The co workers are like any job, you love some, you don't love others, but you work together, because at the end of the day, that's your job. The hardest part is having a dissatisfied customer whom you just can't help. Sometimes, no matter how much you want to fix a problem, or do something to help that customer, Rules, Regulations, Policies just don't allow it. The most enjoyable part? The satisfaction you get from helping someone, whether it's a fellow employee learn a new skill, or if you help a customer track down the perfect 'last one in the store' gift for a son or daughter. The only reason I'm even looking for another job is because the pay isn't where i need it to be for the amount of time i have to spend on the road to get there, and as I'm getting older, I need something more Routine to accomplish some other life goals.

Productive,I really liked working at walmart. Customer service was a great way of meeting new people and helping them with finding products to fit what they were looking for. Walmart was also very hard to advance but overtime I learned every area in the facility and was able to help out customers that were not in my department with the education that I had obtained. Customer service can sometimes be very difficult with dealing with a rude customer but customers always come first and I would try my hardest to satisfy them.,5,Former Employee,Overnight Cashier ,"Humboldt, TN",1/29/13,2013,1,29
my months at walmart,"Go to my register. log in, Clean my area make sure its nice and clean before helping a cutomer. Ive learned how to use a register , ring customers up , bag their items properly.

The job was bad but the people were good,"A typical day in a Wal-mart deli was fast paced and never ending. We were usually understaffed and overbooked. Depending on the day depended on the crew you were given. Most days we worked well together, however, on more than a few occasions petty conflicts of interest and rumors caused uncooperative and hostile work conditions. The higher management were ignorant to everything and blew you off when you were trying to address things. The direct management( department and zone managers) tried the best they could to help but their hands were almost always tied. The best part of the job that I did was the first 2 hrs on the opening shift when I did not have to work with anyone else.",4,Former Employee,Asst Dept manager ,Chippewa Deli,1/29/13,2013,1,29

A good working environment with great co-workers.,Typically my day was just gathering shopping carts in the parking lot or helping customers load groceries or taking out heavy loads for the customers.I learned how to greet customers with kindness. I learned how easy a job it was.Management was ok. I think they could work harder at being better than they were. They didn't pay attention to what was going on around the store at times.I miss my co-workers at Wal-Mart. I'd say that's the only thing I miss about that job.They were kind and fun people to be around.The hardest part of the job would've been the mediocre pay and the benefits.

Why walmart needs to reevaluate the standard of care given to employees,Walmart was the absolute worse company I have worked for in my entire life. I dont say this easily because I myself have a high standard of job care. I take my job very seriously and walmart used that to there advantage to allow senior persons to do as little as possible while forcing honest hard working people to have the threat of termination on seeking higher persons to correct the issue. Myself I was terminated for refusing to come in on my day off so I could witness my mothers Baptism in the Blood of Jesus Christ. I also had a friend terminated for being unable to come in on a similar note that his wife was going into labor. They use the chain of command as a threat to force persons to work harder because there is so few jobs in the market in the local area. I did my best to please but in the end corruption took its hold over myself and many others. In addition the breaks where not fair or mandated to state law.

extremely busy and organized,Wal Mart was a learning experience for me because I was exposed to a bigger dept. store and I was always learning new ways to improve my performance.

I bet they smiled after they thought about me later though! Working in the backrooms for inventory was tedious, lonely, and boring! Yes, even when never having a moment to spare, it was boring.

My co-workers were fun at time, but then their were times that it was a bit stressful. I had an elderly lady working in the department, I was up on a ladder doing a display and she yelled for me. I thought something had happen to her, I came down and she said to me ""This lady wants all this fabric."" I said and the problem is. She said I can't cut all this fabric. I said that is what we are here for, to sell and cut fabric. I Then cut all the fabric and let her price it out. It was like 10 bulks of fabric 1/4 yd of each, the woman was making a quilt.

Horrible place to work!,"A typical day begins with not having any clue what management wants you to do so you do what you think needs done. About 3 hours into your shift, about 3-5 managers will come and ask you to do a different project. Once you start on one, another manager will tell you to do something else(such as run a register, which you have had NO training on). At the register, you will have no clue how to do wic checks or punch in the produce codes so you will call for manager who will show up ten minutes later and wonder why your line is not moving and then tell you they never got the message that you needed assistance.

Each store is different and to be completely honest, no position within retail is going to be a 'dream job' however there were just a lot of issues that never got addressed.

Many different types of machinery were unfamiliar to me before this job, I learned a great deal ab operating a pallet jack and compactor. The managment from my experience was mediocre, it seems they tried to solve the many difficult problems they had without the resources needed to conquer them. My co- workers were very polite and seemed quite adept at handling most problems they faced. I felt that the hardest part of my job was the fact that i worked very short shifts, requiring me to work more of them or be very short on pay.

There were even times that I got phone calls on my day off to ask me questions about certain things. Having to do can orders and they had to be in at least 24 hrs ahead of time if it was a simple one, if I couldn't do it myself I would ask a cake decorator to do it.

My tough 7 years there.,"+A good night was always a breather. A bad night was whenever we were short on people because they didn't have the greatest mindset on scheduling, and had to work triple as hard to pick up the slack.

And some literally wanted ya to get too much done in an unrealistic time frame.+I had some awesome co-workers. It surprises me a good percentage of them made it as long me as well.

My Experience,I really enjoyed working for Walmart. I learned a lot about merchandising and retailing in general. The management team could have been more considered of the employee with the expectation that they had. I really love most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to get things done in the time expected. This was hard because I would want everything in its place before I left and that usually required a bit more time.

Then they accused me of stealing money, which I never did, drilled me for a few hours & then sent me back to work, but nothing ever became of it & they apologized for harassing me they way they did when I never stole anything. I work hard for my money & I would NEVER steal from my job or anywhere for that matter.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"New Castle, IN",1/22/13,2013,1,22
"Decent workplace, not so good management.","Yes, it is the stereotypical review of wal-mart.I had a very good Department manager. But the rest of the management could care less about how your life is going, and more upon their paychecks and their lives. It wasn't horrible, but they had very little sympathy to your living conditions or things that may influence your working ability.

I miss most of them. the job was easy but I ended up getting trained for several departments so sometimes I never knew where I was going to be. Except for the 3 years in pets. I loved it back there. I actually got to get to know my customers and we both learned new things from each other.It was fun.,4,Former Employee,cashier ,"Cheraw, SC",1/22/13,2013,1,22
A family type atmosphere makes it a pleasure to work here,"A typical day is filled with different projects depending on management direction.Projects can include switching out features, resetting modular units and condensing and organizing modular units. This means knowing where your product and where it has been featured. Every day there is the working of exceptions and picks, returning of dropped merchandise, filling empty shelves and binning overstock as well as customer service. I have learned some merchandising, the behind the scenes in retail, how product remains stocked and how to be proactive in keeping the shelves filled,as well as planning of features and maintaining modular integrity. I need to be able to take direction and be able to work independantly as well as be able to work as a team member. I have found management helpful and knowlegeable. My co-workers are awesome, very helpful and I look forward to working with them. Because of the great team effort our work is synergistic. The hardest partof the job can be staying focused on days when an interruption has an interruption which is pretty typical. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to complete a project and can see that it is a job well done. I am a hard worker who is dedicated and loyal to my employer.

Walmart - Its some kind of ride.....,"You've heard about it, but I've lived it. If you have no skills but live in some little community where jobs are scarce, go for it. You still might be able to get Walmart stock, but frankly, if you can go anywhere else to work, Id say go....the managers are poorly trained, I saw and complained ALOT about staff who were repeatedly DRUNK at work and it took as long as 18 months for anything to happen. The general manager had a real arrogance that I found offensive. Cronyism and nepotism is rampant. People protect people who they like. One time the GM asked me to stay into the next shift because the were short, and promised I could keep my extra hours...that promise was forgotten by my personnel manager by the end of the week who asked me to stay home so I wouldnt go over 40 hours. Overall, I was desperate for cash so I took the job, but if I had had any other choices, I wouldnt have...Walmart sucks..its a bottom line type corporation without a soul.

Run from this company,This company doesn't care about its associates at all. They give you a petty 10% discount on stuff you don't really need and allow you to use it on food only one month out of a year. They fight you if you have to take any time off. They don't care if you or a family member is sick. They throw a fit if you have to take any type of leave and they treat you like you are extremely expendable.

Leave your work there,"On a typical day I would work freight, stock, bin, cashier. As a deli associate I would prep food, cook, temp., clean and provide customer service. At any time I was expected to fulfill many roles, particularly since I was trained in multiple skills and work areas.In terms of relating to other people and what I've learned ""kill them with kindness."" Working as a team player is integral to the job. I also learned a great deal about retail operations: managing in-stock and shrink. I learned about some basic automotive services. I also had to become accustomed to having tasks interrupted and moving to another task. Adaptability is key.The hardest part of the job is the part that should make it the job easier: management. Our managers are frequently running around like hens with a wolf in the coup. Everyone is trying to meet the notes or demands of their higher manager. What that means on a practical level is that, particularly at the store level, planning is at a minimum. Day-to-day operations is a constant struggle because our managers are so busy doing that they are not effectively managing and, as a lower level manager, we don't receive the training or support to the do the managing we are expected to accomplish. In a good management scheme, more planning should be handled at the top and doing at the lower levels. Management should step in to help, not be off in a corner trying to perform X, Y, and Z tasks and delegating them until the end of the day. Tasks are important and should be performed, but there is no prioritizing, staffing, or planning to accomplish any of it. - more...",3,Current Employee,Consumables Department Manager ,"Wilmington, NC",1/22/13,2013,1,22

My Years at Wal-Mart,"As a Cashier and Back-Up Customer Service Manager (CSM) at Wal-Mart my typical duties included providing basic check-out devices to customers in the front end of the store, making problem resolution decisions for for other cashiers, managing cashier breaks and lunches, and taking any other action necessary for the smooth operation for the front-end of the store. In a management position I learned how to make decisions based on cost vs. customer satisfaction as well as how to manage a pre-determined employee schedule. The hardest part of the job was trying to please customers while working with the often insufficient resources supplied by upper-management. Accordingly, management-employee relationships could be ""strained"" at times. Likewise, my co-workers were a mix of newer, high-turnover risk people and longtime employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that my actions prevented the front-end from deteriorating into chaos.",2,Current Employee,Cashier/Back-up Customer Service Manager ,"Norman, OK",1/21/13,2013,1,21

Its not the best or the worst,at this walmart you'll be lucky with far more considerate and friendly bosses then cold ones. Its almost like high school though with the coworkers, no matter how old they get they still have plenty to gossipe about. The hardest part of the job is beating the boredom and keeping focused. There are some customers that come in just wanting to argue, which I always found very odd. But if you keep thinking positive and keep reminding yourself there are far worse jobs its not all that bad. The most enjoyable part of the job I found were getting groceries out to peoples cars.

I made my way to third shift which involved the regular duties of a second shift cashier as well as replacing items on the shelf that were returned to the service desk throughout the day. Management never explained things too clearly and was sometimes very rude. WalMart prided itself on friendliness, which it seemed to uphold to customers but not employees.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"York, PA",1/17/13,2013,1,17
Large company,"At work I typically will do some type of audit throughout the day, and catch shoplifters. Management is ok they call us if they need help or if they see anything.

I enjoyed my time,Me personally I really enjoyed my time working at Walmart. The employers made the experience a wonderful one for me. My only criticism is the pay. I felt as though the hours I put in did not reflect on my paycheck. Other than that I loved my management. Of course I had my down days but overall Walmart was a cool job for me. They really love people with great personalities and those who just do their job. If you possess those two things then you will be just fine and considered for promotions quick!,3,Former Employee,CASHIER ,"Lynn, MA",1/17/13,2013,1,17
"Very stressful, co-workers working against you.","My job was to make sure that everything that was leaving the store was paid for, marking the receipts. I would have co-workers, cashiers, managers, and stock men interfere with my job, by saying, "" It's OK!"" But it wasn't OK! A co-worker was leaving the store with a shopping cart full of appliances and when I asked for a receipts she said that they came from home for the luncheon. Big screen tvs were also interfered by co-workers saying I saw him pay for it. And with any interference I was written up. Three write ups and you are out of a job. A person left their job and this was a great opportunity for more hours, but instead of more hours, I got fewer hours??. Now after being fired, I realized that I was not related to anyone there.

They believe they should be number one on your priority list, all that talk about the 'Walmart Family' is complete bull.

Knowledgeable staff,"I worked in both the Electronics and the Connection Center Departments during my time at Wal-Mart. In both instances, I'd spend my day straightening merchandise, restocking shelves, assisting customers and tendering purchases. Many times throughout the day, I'd be called to the front dest to verify a return according to the company's policies. I'd also frequently get asked questions regarding the products and their use, i always answered to the best of my ability. If I wasn't aware of the answer, I'd find someone who did and direct the customer to them.

The media has depict this company as a bad company they are wrong. I am a middle aged latino male that started as a Walmart stocker and in one year I graduated from Walmart University with a certificate in retail management that is good anywhere.

Low Wages,Depending on the department you work it can be very hard work for very little wages. The garden center is full of heavy lifting and constant moving product. Half the management isnt on the same page so sometimes you have to do double the work. After you move one product to one secion or shelf you have to move it again the next day.

A Productive Day,A typical day at Wal-Mart included me watching over multiple departments (sometimes all of the departments in apparel) while also managing the jewelry counter and answering customer phone calls. I've learned about the tasks that needed to be completed by the department manager while at times being treated like one. Management wasn't the best at Wal-Mart. They sometimes treated the employees with disrespect. The co-workers were friendly and tried to help each other throughout the day. The hardest part of the job was that many times I had to watch over all nine departments in apparel and the jewelry counter and help all of the customers.

I learned that everyone is different and some have the worst attitude but the managers were great at making it less stressful and trying to make the customer happy the best they could. It was hard working there though because i dont like to deal with customers when they are at there worst but it was nice working the people that i did and the management was great.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Tire and Lube Express ,"Plainfield, IN",1/16/13,2013,1,16

"Overall, I enjoy what I do - decorating cakes.","In my five years of working for Wal-Mart, I can honestly say that my shopping experience as a customer will no longer be the same. Wal-Mart is known to many as ""Corporate America."" Sure, the company has reasonable prices and great deals, but behind the scenes is less than to be desired. Most members of upper management act like they really value employee opinions, but the truth is they only seek positive attention from their superiors and will do whatever it takes to reach that, up to and including operation by skelton crews and decreased hours per shift. Management has high inconsistancy when it comes to communication, follow-up, and assigning tasks. The impossible is always expected by unforeseen miracles. I am remind of the old saying, ""You can't have your cake and eat it too.""I can honestly say I learned what NOT to do in my own business when the time comes.",3,Current Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Columbus, NE",1/16/13,2013,1,16
My walmart experience,"The year I spent at Walmart was more than I expected and almost more than I could handle. With the constant hassle of working at swift race combined with the unhealthy overnight shift I found myself being hospitalized. The heavy lifting, the work environment, the health risks and manager attitudes was the deciding factor in my decision to remove myself from their company. Time and time again I was met with shift managers that refused to cooperate and compromise with even the smallest of requests. The extra dollar from working overnight was not worth it in my opinion if it came with daily migraines from stress and body pains from the work load. The pay was decent. But I did enjoy the other employees that felt similar to my disposition. But all an all I have no regrets from my entire walmart experience at all. It was a life lesson and I can always appreciate learning something new.",3,Former Employee,Overnight stocker/assembler/cashier ,"Orlando, FL",1/16/13,2013,1,16

The management there were responsible leaders, helping us all the time to accomplish all the demands of our jobs. My co-workers were cooperative and we were always working together as a team. The hardest part of the job was probably when someone didn't show up to work because we would have to skip some things that we have planned to do.

Things I do and that happen on a normal night,"After punching in I had 3 minutes to get to the front to sign in to register, but usually I had customers stop me to ask where they could find products, so didn't always make it on time. Customer is always first a priority. After signing into register I had to go up and down each register to check for things that didn't belong (customers are always deciding they don't want something and just sitting it down anywhere). Then I had to zone the seasonal section, if we were busy I would have to get on a register to get lines down. When evening cashiers got off I had to get on register. I had freight to stock up front at registers, also 2 nights a week I have gum and candy to stock as well as check out customers. If zoning didn't get finished at registers and seasonal area I had to work that in while stocking and waiting on customers. If we had more cashiers that night management would pull 1 cashier and csm or more to stock in the rest of store, leaving me and maybe 1 cashier and csm (customer service manager) up front (most of the time I was by myself) The csm and cashier had to put up returns (returns are things people have returned and things we have found where they didn't belong) in the dept where they went. Returns are coming up all night from managers and associate's finding things in their area that didn't belong. So on a normal night I was covering the whole front end by myself. If everyone was out stocking I also had to sort the returns and put them in carts or back in the bins.

Got hired.Orientation: 2 or 3 days of orientating, had to do a lot of CBL (computer based training) tasks, most were long and boring. What is told in CBL was hardly ever followed in the workplace.Work: Typical day was like this; arrived at 11 PM to do freight. Manager told me 10 days after starting I was supposed to be in at 10. Started coming in at 10, then was asked to come in at 9 to down stack pallets for each aisle. Had to use worn out equipment, try pulling a 3400 pound pallet with a junk pallet jack. Supposed to be off at 6 AM, I had to sneak out of the store to be off on time. Got wrote up for leaving. Started to work from 9 until typically 830. Workload was ridiculous. One person to do 2, 3, sometimes 4 pallets of freight. Always changed aisles so there was no continuity.Management: Most of the managers have no idea how to manage people. They have no idea how to do their jobs. Threats and belittlement is the name of the game. Lack of planning on their part constitutes a crisis on the workers.Coworkers: best part of the job, but at the same time, most are eccentric, or just weird.My opinion: this was the WORSE job I ever had.

For the most part management was pretty good.

Working for Walmart was not a good experience due to management team,"Ordered merchandise, stocked shelves, built displays, customer service, ran register, trained new associates, unload trucks, inventory control. In my time as Garden shop department manager the department had the highest increase in sales for 3 months straight. Some management team was great but most upper management member made promises and did not keep them. Co-work were great to work with.

My review,"This was my first real job at the age of 17. I do not believe that the management worked with employees in the way that taught them the skills needed to advance and make them a better employee. I worked with about 4-5 guys, ages 17-18 years. We were expected to work things out for ourselves, which at times did not work out. This is where I feel management should have been responsible for helping build us and help mold us into better and productive workers. I enjoyed my fellow employees and enjoy helping people.",2,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Clarksville, TN",1/13/13,2013,1,13

A Job,"I worked the seasonal Night shifts as a stocker; every night began with a little preparation and then right to work stocking shelves, not too exciting. One hour into every shift we had an employee meeting which frequently felt like a waste of time, since we were expected to get a high amount of work done within our shifts every night, and the meetings were very much a personal pat on the back for management, instead of being informative for employees.The people I worked with were good folks, hard working and helpful in most cases. I learned that Walmart monitors their employees work through a scanning system where you scan your badge and click on links to indicate tasks started and completed, and the system was slow and took a lot of time in most cases; time that could have been better used doing the workload instead of monitoring employees progress.Management seemed disconnected frequently from the realities of the work they expected to be done, and didn't seem to have the same workloads that were expected of the employees. The hardest part of the Job was dealing with managements lack of understanding of the work, and their disconnect with the everyday tasks employees are expected to perform.Overall the Job is a good one if you don't mind hard work for minimum wage and are ok with dealing with a Management team that is more concerned with their own personal advancement and less concerned with the actual job and stores needs.",3,Former Employee,Night Stock Clerk ,"Mount Vernon, WA",1/13/13,2013,1,13

Enter at your own risk,"Department Managers are extremly overworked and very under payed. They are the heartbeat of the store. They are responsible for price changes, working freight, merchandising in every aspect, setting modulars, and conversions for every holiday and event. They do all the work while the salaried members of management receives all the recognition for a job well done. The store manager walks the store every morning while the assistant managers take notes. Those notes are then passed to the Department Managers and they have to be done no matter the cost. If they are not DM are held responsible. The morale in the stores are not of Sam Walton. He would literally turn in his grave if he knew the how the associates he paved the way for are now being treated.

Great Company overall,Everyday you know what is expected and what has to be done in order for you to go home on time as a Manager.

"Not the best, but far from the worst","In a typical day, you can expect to feel like you've accomplished nothing, or possibly that you are moving backwards. You will be pushed to and, in some cases, past your breaking point, but it is for not only the good of the store but it builds your character as well. It's a great first job, you will learn the ins and outs of retail, which is a very handy skill to have. The management is great. Most of them worked their way up in the company, making them familiar with the plights of working there. Some times they push beyond their bounds, but most of the time they are down to earth. You can easily develop a relationship with your co-workers which makes the time there pass much faster than if you didn't have that opportunity. While the work may not be the most pleasurable it is a challenge, the most difficult part of my job was that I had to piece together the freight in a way that minimized space taken up, and was still stable to stand on its own, while still accounting for it. However, this was not a terrible task, as my managers would allow us to listen to our music on a stereo that they had purchased for us.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Inventory Control Specialist ,"Portland, OR",1/13/13,2013,1,13

"Good Pay, not so good benefits","Working at Walmart was fine as long as I didn't want a life outside of work. At first they were flexible, but in the year i was there, there were 4 different supervisors in my department. The reason I quit was because I requested a holiday off because I was going to be out of town, and they gave the new manager the holiday off but scheduled me to work. A typical day of work for me was to slice meats and cheese, prepare hot food using deep fryers, serve customers, do dishes, shut down the fryers, and other cleaning duties to close the department. My co-workers were generally a good group to work with, not just in my department but the whole store. The hardest part of the job wasn't the job itself, it was the scheduling, the late nights and not being with my kids, and not being home on weekends.

If you have the motivation and ambition to figure things out, you can learn all the aspects of the company on the quiet nights on 3rd shift. The managers get to know you better because it is a smaller staff than on days, which helps your chances for promotion. Some managers are more awesome than others, but you learn to roll with the punches. Remember hard work is rewarded and you never have to worry about losing your job if so. I previously worked at warehouse/dock so nothing about 3rd shift is hard. Repetitive work is easy on the mind.

"stable for long-term work, but few have the patience to stay for the long-term","A review of a day at Walmart is kind of a wild card, especially if you're working on the salesfloor, the backroom is generally straightforward but if you're anywhere on the salesfloor, expect to be pulled out of your department to work in another place in the store to cover gaps in employment at least once per day, multiple times per day if you're good at your job. I've spoken with many associates who have transferred from other stores across the country and locally, there are a lot of problems here, profiteering has driven wages into the ground for an excessive amount of work, on the Inventory Control Team, pay is minimal for back-breaking labor oftentimes the lack of appropriate staffing and intense pressure to get your work done at faster than the already robotically high truck completion speeds make for a high-risk environment for injury, directly in contradiction of their policies towards heavy lifting, on the salesfloor you can get in trouble for not finding a second associate to lift a heavy box, while in the backroom you can get chewed out for taking the extra moment to try and save your back from lifting entertainment centers by yourself. Coworkers run the whole gamut, I've seen people with their masters degree, and people who dropped out of high school in the same environment, same pay, same respect. Prior knowledge from across the company, is rarely rewarded, and hiring is completely arbitrary. Management isn't incompetent, though, corporate rides management so hard that they barely have an oppportunity to truly manage in a way that they'd like to, I've seen lots - more...",2,Former Employee,Inventory Control Specialist ,"Columbia, MO",1/10/13,2013,1,10
Productive complex company with many learning opportunities.,Wal-Mart is such a diverse company to work for and has provided me with many opportunities to learn and grow from. I have learned to pick my battles and to always move forward from any negative event. As an undercover asset protection associate I have learned to work under extreme and stressful situations; as well as slower moving investigations that require high levels of patience.The best part of my job was closing every shoplift case with confidence because of the thorough investigation and detailed evidence gathered.,4,Current Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Chandler, AZ",1/10/13,2013,1,10

If there is help needed in any department around the store and you are done with your job you will go help where needed. The customers are lively and keep you on your toes. Co workers are friendly and work together to make sure evry job is done in a proper and timely manner. Management is not that great. The managers change quite frequently and it just seems as though there is no communication between them. The hardest part of the job is not being reckognized for you accomplishments.

They definitely don't stay true to their ""beliefs"" they were founded upon, one being integrity, which is thrown out the window there! The employees are expected to be perfect but the mangers are liars!!! They don't care a single bit about your valuable family time and expect you to devote your LIFE to that place!

For the nine years I was employed there, I was given more and more responsibility and eventually promoted to assistant store manager.I started out needing a part time job to supplement my income from another job.The hardest part of the job was being short of co-workers who didnt show up, propmting coachings. The most enjoyable part of the job was teaching and training associates and watching them take on more responsibility. A typical day was fast paced with reports and projects to complete all the while keeping the customer first.

Unorganized work place,Is a unorganized workplace where the managers do not communicate well with each other. There are never enough registers open to tend to the customers needs to get them in and out. They are not the least bit concerned about the well being of their employees nor customers.

WalMart,Working here stocking third shift was not to bad really. The people were nice and most of the time it wasn't to stressful. The only thing that the management did really that wasn't right was tried to make everyone stay after for over time but take it off the next night during lunch. To me that didn't make sense really. They also threatened to write people up for not taking off the over time but that is when a few of us called corporate. Had also found out that the main man of the night shift had been pocketing the bonuses that we were suppose to get in our pay checks.,3,Former Employee,Third Shift Stocker ,"Louisville, KY",1/10/13,2013,1,10
Productive and great team to work with.,"This is a fast-paced environment that keeps one busy through an entire shift, so a work day goes by pretty quick.

Management can be very good there or very bad at any walmart. Thankfully the management is great at my walmart and couldn't be happier.

I had to make sure all the clothes were folded or hung up neatly. I did my paper work and order any merchandise that I needed. Once a year I had to reset my floor. This means there was a new way they wanted the department to look so that we could get more sales. And there was no one at the fitting rooms I had to sit there and let people in, refold or hang up returns, answer the phones and transfer calls where they needed to go.

"Fast-paced, high work expectations for the pay","The job has set hours, but random days. I go in to work at 4 P.M. and head to the backroom to unload the general merchandise truck. All the freight is organized onto pallets to be wheeled out later. The truck can take anywhere from an hour and a half to three hours to unload. Usually, management begins to wonder after about two and a half hours.Once the truck is unloaded, we take our first break, which is 15 minutes. After, we split into two groups. If the grocery truck is big, we send the majority there to help down stack all the grocery items. The other one or two go to sort out break packs from the GM truck, which consist of smaller products that would be crushed among the other boxes.If the grocery truck is not so big, then the two aforementioned tasks are still done, while a third group from the team are sent out to stock some products from the GM truck. These are only ever pet, chemical, and paper products.We do this until our hour meal break at 8. Once we come back, we take all the pallets, GM and grocery, to their correct destination on either the sales floor or the backrooms, via pallet jacks. This usually takes one to two hours, depending on the size of the truck. Afterwards, we stock all the freight and organize (zone) them into their correct spots. This includes freight from that day's trucks, and freight that was overstock from any previous days. We work until clocking out at 1.

While working at Wal*Mart I have learned how to run a cash register and how to run Customer Service, I have also learned how to get an irate customer to calm down and listen to what you are trying to explain to them. My management team really listens when you have a problem and tries their best to come up with a solution to help you solve your problem. The people I work with are always willing to help you whenever they can, There really is not a hard part about my job, but if I had to pick one situation it would be when I am working in Customer Service and the customer does not like being told that they are not able to return the item for whatever reason.

walmart,"Over all I love my job at Walmart. I have worked in every department and have learned the store inside and out. My coworkers are easy to get along with.

But most important, I managed to learn about medicines, like names and actions. It's also a very friendly and interactive workplace, since I always had something to talk about with co workers and managers. I truly felt at home when I was at work. I couldn't ask for a better team. What was hardest was trying to make and keep every customer happy. It is unfortunate that we cannot give every customer what they want. But we always strive to prevent issues from happening and keeping a consistent, fast workflow.

horrible place,"I was a cake decorator and I LOVED the actual work part of the job. I got to make childrens birthday parties special as well as weddings and other special occasions. HOWEVER, the managers cared absolutely nothing about your life or how you feel or anything. First, I had a manager ask me to come in at different times for two weeks than what i was scheduled so i assumed she had let other management know and changed my schedule. Nope, I was reprimanded for what they thought was 2 tardies and 1 no show. After pleading my case, i kept my job. Now my job was tuesday through saturday 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. One weekend was coming up and we had a tonnnnn of orders and because they had just fired the other decorator, i was the only one. So they asked me to work friday overnight after working 7-3 on friday. I agreed. So i left work at 3 and came back at 10p on friday. Well, i worked until 7a.m. on saturday then went to clock out and they told me no. I needed to make stock cakes for the cooler. So then, i worked until 12 p.m. Then I went to leave and they still wanted me to stay until 5 p.m! I had just found out i was pregnant and they were aware of this. When I reminded them about this, they told me ""I should stop being a baby and do my job before i get fired."" So I threw in the towel right there!

Shipping clerk,"A typical day was a brutal day. Every day was a struggle. either i would be in a heavy lane or i would be bouncing back and forth between two lanes.

I also learned how to operate power equipment such as a walkie and a PE which is a vehicle that can lift and transport two pallets at a time. I learned how to make pallets of non conveyable freight and how to use a shrink wrap machine and also how to shrink wrap pallets and secure trailer loads using pallets. The management as a whole was a decent management, but as far as the management just in the shipping dock was concerned, it needed vast improvement. The shipping managers seemed to much on a high horse. They were to quick to get people in trouble rather than to try and help people to fix problems. My co-workers were great to work with we all tried to help eachother.

Throughout the day, every task is taken care of quickly and accurately; tasks including taking care of all phone calls and faxes, insuring the patient has the least amount of wait time while filling his or her prescription accurately, organizing shelf space and maintaining a sterile environment, organizing patient files while always practicing HIPPA, and following up with patients and their doctor's offices to insure they are receiving the care they deserve.At this job, I have learned that customer service is ALWAYS the number one priority. Every task with this position is linked to customer, so every task needs to be hand fast and efficiently for the best customer care available.The coworkers at this pharmacy understand how important teamwork is. Most tasks performed are all teamwork related; from inputting the prescription, to double checking the prescription, to filling and to finalizing the prescription. It is a very fluid process that my coworkers and I understand well.There really isn't a hard part to this job.

Decent income for a college student,"I have worked here since freshman year in college and I was able to get by with the pay that I was receiving. They were flexible and allowed me to work around my school schedule. Although I have found that after graduating and two school age children later that the demanding hours and lack of full time positions are not meeting my needs. It was good while it lasted but as my needs have changed, it is time to do something different.As the years have gone on it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep a full staff, which puts more pressure on the remaining employees. I have experienced a lack of morale among associates. With the depleted staff there is no one in their designated areas servicing the customers making customers upset.

Not bad to work for,"On a typical 8 hr day, you receive a 15 min break at the second and 6th hour, and an hour lunch break at the 4 hr mark. They are very adamant about taking your breaks and that when you work you are on the clock. They are very adamant about no overtime what so ever.

working at walmart,"Going to work everyday you will always have something to do. Customer service is the main focus while at work.

"I liked the people I worked with, but the Walmart management team is terrible.","I've worked with this company for 5 years. The management team is so disorganized. One tells you one thing, the other tells you something else. They're throwing each other under the bus, and use the lower level employees as pawns to further their own careers. You are nothing more than a number to them. They play mind games to try and convince you that Walmart takes priority over all else. They don't like independent minds, they would rather have drones. The employees are overworked and under appreciated... I could go on, but I'd rather not give you a wall of text.",1,Current Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Pittsburgh, PA",1/4/13,2013,1,4

Overall: not a very good place to work.,"When I first started the job was not too difficult. My crew consisted of 11-13 people depending on day of the week. Gradually, work conditions worsened after people either quit or were fired. For a lengthy duration, my crew consisted of 3-5 members, and we often had to handle the workload of three people. Management was bad at communicating. Every department operated on skeleton crews. And, if management could get the same production out of less people--regardless of overworking the people they did have--they thought nothing of it.",3,Former Employee,"Warehouse Truck Unloader, ICS ","Galveston, TX",1/4/13,2013,1,4
"I enjoyed my job but working at multiple stores and multiple departments, people are not held accountable for not doing their job.",The few people who do work hard are told to pick up the slack of the others who don't do their work. It's exhausting and I've watched it happen well over two yrs. I received exceeds expectations each time on my evaluation yet was never considered for management though they told me this is the kind of person they want as manager. I was stuck in a corner doing my job and several others'.,3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Van Wert, OH",1/4/13,2013,1,4

i would work there again if given the opportunity,Fast pace and somedays slow but mostly steady depending on the time of day. I learned a lot about handling cash and the different programs that help someone buy food when they are not working or don't make enough to buy food and how to multitask under stressful times. My coworkers where great to work with they helped me with suggestions to move quicker and keep the line moving at a steady pace. The hardest part of the job was when irate or impatient customers would come to your line and you had a transaction that takes more time than the usual and they would start yelling at you. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and becoming friends with coworkers outside of the workplace. Management was understanding of situations out of your control.

Slave Labor,Extremely understaffed. To many of the managers that have no clue of whats going on. Tell you to do something and change their mind a hour later and everyhing has to be redone. They expect you to work for peanuts and do the work of 2 or 3 people. Overwork their good people and keep the dead beats. Double standards when it comes to what they say and what they do.,1,Former Employee,former employee ,Raritan NJ,1/4/13,2013,1,4
Great place to work at when in school.,"A typical day, for the most part, dealt with getting returns, zoning my departments, and making sure all merchandise in the backroom was put away. I learned various things, from the backroom to the sales floor. I learned about the daily cycle of a retail store and how all the departments and people contribute to work together as one. Management and co-workers had a wide range of people. Some were extremely nice and others not so much. It all depends on the person. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. No matter what, the customer comes first and you always must try to meet their satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was easy to work while in school and I liked being able to talk to a large variety of people everyday.",4,Former Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Mukwonago, WI",1/4/13,2013,1,4

I learned how to decorate cakes and make them just right and personalize them for each and every customer. If a Co-Worker would come in with a little bit of an edge, I would find a way to at least crack a smile from them.One of the hardest parts of the job was learning how to decorate a Wedding Cake.

Wal-mart is a good place to work to obtain customer service skills.,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is a day of good old fashioned hard work. The tasks assigned may change multiple times throughout the day, but at the end of the day, the job gets done. Management usually takes the harder route of completing tasks because they do not like to be ""undermined"" when a faster solution is presented to them. I believe that was the hardest part of the job. Trying to help in a more effective and more productive solution and then being told that it is disrespectful to present ideas. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction. There is nothing better than to make someone's day by giving them the best customer service that can possibly be provided. Happy customers lead to more business.",3,Former Employee,Inventory Management Specialist ,"Wooster, OH",1/4/13,2013,1,4

Don't get injured as a temp,"I was happy to have a job at Wal*Mart because a job is a job. But when I was hit by a car when riding my bike home, and the doctor's gave me a note stating I could work after 3 days of rest (nothing was broken, just sprained). They immediately laid me off, then treated me very poorly when I went to pick up my final paycheck.On top of that they constantly treated me like I had no intelligence was very insulting. (I get it, a lot of people who work at Wal*Mart aren't smart, but there are some of us!) There were many times as a cashier I was ""reminded how to do things"" that I was doing right and got yelled at for closing my register because they failed to respond to my many requests for change.If you have a choice, do not apply to Wal*Mart.

Most miserable retail job ever!,"Worst place that I have ever worked for. Pay is terrible, work conditions are miserable, and management team is a joke.",1,Former Employee,ICS ,"Longview, TX",1/3/13,2013,1,3
Walmart,"Typical day starts with a meeting, then straight to your assignment. I learned how to use a Telxon to navigate items in the store, and to keep track of inventory. Also how to use forklift and scissor lift.Direct management was ok to work with. There were the few who would overstep their professional boundaries. Co-managers and store managers were very difficult people to work with. They were very hard on the older/elderly employees, which was difficult to watch. Coworkers were mostly good people.Hardest part of the job was meeting the impossible goals management would sometimes set. Returning inventory to the back room, they want it all put back on the backroom shelves, yet many times there is just not room to fit it all, and you take the fall for that. Also, you will get fussed at for not completely filling a shelf, for example, but at the same time you will get yelled at if you open a box and the whole box doesn't fit on the shelf. So it's a no-win. But you learn to take the yelling and move on.Most enjoyable part of the job was working with people who just want to get the job done, and work together to do it.",3,Former Employee,Backroom Inventory ,"Indian Trail, NC",1/3/13,2013,1,3

The people I worked with where excellent,"Walmart is a very unappreciative company. They are a revolving door and can't keep employees. They do not treat their floor people with much respect and their lower management with even less respect. Your hours are all over the place, and if you can't do the hours they set for you, they are not flexable. My coworkers were great many different diversities and culters. They are what made working at Walmart fun.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Amherst, NH",1/3/13,2013,1,3

Don't get injured while working.,"I worked outside as a Courtesy Clerk. My usual tasks included gathering and restocking the carts, assisting customers with shopping, battery storage, and other duties as assigned. I had a great team of guys to work with and I think this job really improved my speaking abilities. The management was friendly but very disconnected in light of the workload we were faced with. When one of my coworkers got frostbite on his foot while working, they wouldn't allow him to collect workmans comp and he was let go. The hardest part of the job was pushing enough carts to keep up because the snow added a lot of drag. The thing I liked most about this job was communicating with customers.",3,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Wasilla, AK",1/2/13,2013,1,2

Overall it was a great learning experience. Wal-mart taught me how to work with and deal with people better.,"My days at work were filled with different things to do. I enjoyed being busy all day. I worked with alot of different people, but the hardest part was having to anwser to like 10 different managers.",4,Former Employee,stocker ,"Matthews, NC",1/2/13,2013,1,2
The work business,"Wal-mart was not the best place to work for, because it's very hard to get full-time. Right when you are on the verge of becoming full-time, a manager comes up with an excuse to stop you. You may start out getting almost 40 hours a week and then all at once your down to 4 hours a week. It's very hard to make a living at wal-mart, that is why so many people will search for another job. I learned that not every employer is going to keep their employees happy, especially if their moto is the customer is always right. The most enjoyable part of working at wal-mart, was all the co-workers I had worked with.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Union City, TN",1/2/13,2013,1,2

Long work schedule and have to relocate,"Since I was a manager, I had to work 2-3 12 hour work day.

The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and building relationships with frequent customers.",4,Former Employee,Direct Receiving/ Customer Service ,"Union City, GA",1/2/13,2013,1,2
A stressful workplace,"A typical day at work would be picking out merchandise, and sending them out to the sales floored to be stocked by sales floor associates. Some days I would do sales floor counts on merchandise. I've learned over the years how to maintain, implement & use a backroom storage system to track merchandise. The hardest part of the job would be to deliver items on time, as multiple departments had multiple items to be picked at the same time. That created a lot of stress, having to figure out which departments to get merchandise out first, and thus letting other departments wait to get their stuff. Co-Workers were decent enough to deal with, but management would often times be unreasonable or couldn't figure out ways to better improve binning conditions.",2,Former Employee,Inventory team member/sales floor associate ,"Porter Ranch, CA",1/2/13,2013,1,2

Great Work out,A typical day at work would involve unloading the truck and then bringing the merchandise out to the floor and then pick merchandise in the back warehouse for the rest of the evening. I learned that any job can be fun if you allow yourself to enjoy it. My co-workers were amazing they became good friends of mine. The hardest part of the job was having to come in on the weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would go out for our lunch break to a near by place.,4,Former Employee,My title was an ICS associate ,"Bourbonnais, IL",1/2/13,2013,1,2
Basic Day At Walmart,"I help with unloading our frozen trucks that carry our freight, also I cook and keep the rotation of our products in the deli fresh and presentable to the customers. I have learned alot more about food saftey and the saftey with unloading trucks with forklifts. Managment is ok jus feel like some are doing their job and some are not. I get along with most of my coworkers, kinda like a big family. The hardest part of my job is the schedule rotation its not set but I make it work for me.

Resonable Employer,"The company is a decent employer. They require breaks and lunches, so there is no forcing you to skip breaks. Overall there is no major problems to working here. You tend to just be a number here though, personal relationships are difficult to build. Working your way up the ladder revolves around computers (to get into management you must pass a test and then wait 2 years to re-take the test), instead of looking at which workers actually hold the potential to actually do the job well. I have never had a problem with management, I am actually pretty well liked, but I have had issues getting to where I would like to be because of the computer system having an error. Management seems to not know what they are doing/talking about unless they are one of the ones that have worked their way up.",3,Current Employee,"Cashier, Customer Service Representative ","Woodhaven, MI",1/2/13,2013,1,2

Frinedly envoronment with great coeworkers.,"My typical day at work starts with me clocking in and checking in with my CSMs to see what station I will be working from. Some days I am provided with a list of breaks and lunches to cover throughout the day. Once at a register I make sure I have the materials I need to preform my tasks such as receipt tape, bags, antibacterial, pens, etc. What I have learned from my job is refining my time management skills and improving my people skills as well. As a waitress and as a cashier there is a certain amount of time you need to be able to anticipate and a wide range of people you are going to be dealing with. The management group is really understanding friendly and flexible. There is not a single coworker that I do not get along with, they are all wonderful people. The hardest part of my job is also the most enjoyable, and that would be packing the bags in an organized way that wont break them. I enjoy the puzzle of putting it together.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Mukwonago, WI",1/2/13,2013,1,2

"Great co-workers but, managers only care and appreciate other managers.","The managers at Walmart do not respect employees who are underneath their job title. The managment is very disrespectful even when you complete your task the do not praise your accomplishment, they just complain about what else needs to be done before they leave for the day. There are supposed to be no reprecussions for expresing a complaint but this is not true. The management does not care about their employees just their paychecks.

Good work place and environment,"The experince that I had while at Wal-Mart was good to fair. The management was sometimes pushy and demanded more of you than what your pay rate was. The other co-workers were somewhat friendly and helpful. If you were not a deptartment or upper management then you were low-life scum. The job was enjoyable most of the time except around holidays i.e. Christmas. The pay was minnium, with average benifits. If your a high school grad or working your way durring college, I would recommend this job to you. If you are a single mother with kids or even married and trying to make this job your income for a family, don't.

Keeping Wal-mart clean and tidy while showing customer service and ensuring customer satisfaction.,Wal-mart is a good job for someone starting out in the world and needing some job experience.

I learned how to get use to the area I worked at. One of my co-workers were nice and respectful. Well the hardest about the job is trying to find the codes and when you cant find the codes, gets frustrating. Most enjoyable part of the job, is meeting new people, and helping others look for the product their are looking for.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart ,"York, PA",1/2/13,2013,1,2

Cookie-Cutter Job Was Not For Me,Wal-Mart seemed to forget about individual needs. It seemed as though they reminded the employees that there were several other people in line for their job the moment any one asked for a specific day off or specific hours.

I also would be a lot attendant and get the carts off of the lot and make sure that the store had plenty of shopping carts for our incoming customers. My co-workers were very professional and very an absolute joy to work with and the same goes for management. I had a situation where I needed to go out of state for Christmas time and my manager awarded me some time off when I was normally scheduled. I built strong bonds in a short time with my co-workers at Walmart.The most enjoyable part of the job definitely has to be the customers themselves and dealing with them.

Work was log hours for very little pay or respect.,"Cashiering, stocking shelves, sweeping floors, helping other dept. when they needed help. I learned you can't depend on breaks of any kind being given on time if ever. Cashiers are ignored by the CSM's until they wanted to acknowledge your need for their assistance. Most co-workers were great to work with but there were several who didn't have to pay attention to their jobs so the rest of us had to do their jobs too yet they kept their jobs with nothing ever being said or done to change it. They were the ones who always got a promotion even though they didn't deserve it. Being made to feel like a 2nd class citizen which I'm not nor is anyone else.

After the meeting was over everybody then broke off and got their supplies ready for the night; pallet jacks,garbage bags, rocket cart/ ""L""carts. then we proceeded to go to our area for the night and begin to stock the shelves with the merchandise that came in for that day. As we stock we are cleaning and straightening the other merchandise. The ovrstock items are placed on the carts and brought to the back to be binned into the system. When completed with my area I would then go to the back and help bin, or go to a different area of the store and help another assiosate stock and finish their section.

Retail,"Walmart was a very interesting company to work for. After a year and a half, I was disappointed with the opportunity for advancement. It was very political, almost as if you needed to ""know someone"" in order to advance your career. The management team was not very helpful.

"enjoyable associates, too much expectations and no time to finish everything assigned.","A large business with concern about making money, not paying employees their value, and expecting too much in return. Mostly people who really need a job work there and will then do almost anything required of them to keep their job. The management expects too much and wants everyone to do many different types of work for no extra pay. No overtime paid, just told to take a longer lunch or come in later, to make up for too much time worked. it is also a very physical job, moving merchandise around all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fellow workers, they are all dedicated and want to do a good job, but management takes advantage by putting more and more work on them.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Festus, MO",12/31/12,2012,12,31
Smart Retailer,"Walmart is one of the most well organized retailers I have ever seen. You do work hard but you get paid for it, better than most places out there. It is very easy to advance so long as you work hard to get there. As with any chain there is a chance that the management in one store is better than in others, they are all run differently. Overall it is a good company to work for, they do take care of their people but it becomes your life. They become your family and friends and that can make it seem like there is no work/life balance.

Stressful and Unprofessional Working Environment with Emphasis on Speed rather than Quality of Work,"A typical day at work would involve one RPh with a shift from 8 am to 5 pm and another RPh arriving at noon and closing at 9 pm. Each RPh would stand at a particular computer and do a 4 pt.check on each new rx then a visual check of each (new and refill) rx before bagging the prescription and stapling the pharmacy receipt to the bag. Every action of each RPh was recorded by the Walmart computer system. The average number of prescriptions which were four point checked and visualized were recorded for daily, weekly and monthly percentages. Therefore, if a pharmacist was interested or felt the need to walk out front into the otc section and personally help a patient with questions or recommendations or actually spend time counseling a patient for appropriate medication usage, that time spent away from their work station would actually decrease that particular pharmacist's work production averages. Consequently causing that pharmacist to be ""coached"" by the DM. After three coachings a RPh is terminated. That is the ""hardest"" part of the job of working for Walmart. The management of pharmacy at Walmart is interested in numbers only and not the quality of particular patient care. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay rate which doesn't matter as much when the professionalism of your career has been taken out of the equation.",2,Former Employee,Pharmacist ,"based out of Beckley, WV",12/29/12,2012,12,29

Interesting place to work.,What happens during my day at work depends on the day and what's going on at the time. If it's dull it goes by slow and if it's busy it goes by fast. Customer service is all about patience and not letting things get to you. I have definitely learned how to deal eighties people. I love my coworkers and bosses most days.

The best part at Wal-mart was helping customers and working with the great cashiers I had and other floor associates I got to work with as well.,"I was the opening CSM, I got the podium money in the drawers, counted and set. I made sure the money center and customer service desk was set with loan money so they were ready for business and customers wouldn't have to wait. I set the schedule board and made sure all breaks and lunches were covered and the amount of registers were opened as required by head office per hour. Gave job duties to cashiers and made sure department 82 freight (candy and gum) was filled and all carts of freight worked by 10 am and the front end kept clean and organized. I made sure the stock-man kept the lot clear of carts and help was given to him when needed to keep carts in the store ready for our customers use. I communicated with maintenance to make sure he helped when needed with the carts and to cover the stock-mans lunch and any concerns and where we needed him to start his cleaning first if a particular restroom was excessively dirty. I answered calls on the palm pilot, did register over rides and regularly signed off customer service desk returns. Helped at customer service as needed. Handled customer and associates complaints usually without having to call a manager higher up to confirm what I said was true and store policy. Helped at the money center or on register when they were busy as needed and gave loans to the money center and change orders to cashiers as they were requested. The best part of the job was working with such great people as my cashiers and most of the sales floor associates I worked with and helping our customers.

"Extemely fast pased environment, introduced me to multitasking, and the importance of providing execellent customer service.","Working for almost 9 years for this company was a life changing experiece. It was both very rewarding, and very challenging at times. When I first started, I did not expect myself to transform a regular cashier job into a respective management position with a great deal of responsibility. A typical day included the most important and fun part of my job which was practicing the ten-foot rule. Engaging with customers, asking them if they needed help,and providing each and every customer with an excellent customer service experience. All the duties, responsibilities, expectations, and daily tasks I was given, would not have been completed if it weren't for the passionate, hard-working, unique group of associates that I had the privaledge of managing. Every relationship I developed with fellow co-workers became a lifelong connection, and friendship. I still keep in touch with most of my previous management and past co-workers. All the skills and training I received at this job was ultimately important for any career or future job I may have. I would have to say that one of the most challenging experiences I encountered while working for this multi-billion dollar company was having to sometimes work during holidays and or special family events. As a previous employee of Walmart I learned the trade of the Retail Industry and its demands. I also learned the importance for providing customers with unmatched customer service while allowing them the opportunity to save money.

Steady and decent company to work,"I worked overnight shift at walmart, first as a cashier. As a cashier I was expected to take care of costumers, check their items out using the scanner, cash register and maintaining a cash draw. I would clean all registers, collect trash, random items needing to be put back on shelves, sweep and restock. I then switched to inventory associate position, which was more fast paced and kept me busy throughout my entire shift, unlike cashiering. As an inventory associate, I would use computer system to see what items were needed out on the floor and collect those items from the backroom for the stockers. There would be items in every department and we would have 5 hours at the most to collect all items shown. After we would then start collecting the overstock and enter that back into the system, with correct counts, package it and put in proper, designated area.Management at the particular Walmart I worked at, was to me, all over the place. There was the general manager, then 2 assistant gms, and countless other manager positons, so things would get a little confusing, meaning you could have one manager come up and tell you to do something in particular and then have another come up and tell you to do something completely different.

I found this highly fun and educational!My managers and co-workers were all very open and helpful. When I made a mistake, they took the time to help me correct it and gave me nothing but positive encouragement!The most difficult parts of the job were finding the correct pressure (PSI) on the machine for making specific parts and following some recipes for particular batches of material. If either were even the slightest bit off, the product wouldn't come out right.For me, the most satisfying part of this job was seeing the finished product.

We greet them, ask if they are finding everything, let them know where we'll be if they need any help, and thank them for shopping at our store. Throughout the day, there might be customers and us associates that doesn't know the location to a certain item and we have to use a scanner that tells us specific locations to items throughout the store.

A big box company that says it values its workers... but does it?,"a typical day at work involves dealing with customers that are unappreciative and rude as well as management that expects you to do a job that it would take six people six hours to do in ten minutes. The pay is decent for what the job is, but you still never make enough to feel that it is worth putting up with the abuse. They are usually good about working with availability if you have a good assistant manager. Some managers make it very apparent that they do not like you and will do their best to not work with you. Co-workers are ready to point fingers at the drop of a hat when something goes wrong. Co-workers are generally lazy and will push off their work onto you or just flat out not do it so that it looks like you are the one who has not been working. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the co-worker's drama as well as the rude customers.

"Not much advancement, little compensation. The life seems to be sucked out of you.","I worked at Wal-Mart a total of about 2 years. First in the Garden center and then as a cashier (after leaving and coming back for college and such) and then as a cell phone sales associate. Typical day includes dealing with customers. The customers make or break your day in a job in sales. Working with people in the cell phone kiosk was especially rewarding or draining, because you spend on average 15-30 minutes with each customer. I did learn a lot about technology in this position and I was continuously learning about new stuff so I could inform the customers. As a cashier, people seem to forget you're human. And sometimes I think the cashiers forget they're human as well. This leads to them being treated pretty badly. I did learn how to talk with people a bit more up there. To help pass the time, I would try to ask people about news events/social issues. This usually only worked on people who were in the longer lines and as I was checking as fast as I could, we would discuss. Sometimes people couldn't care less and sometimes it seemed to brighten their day. The management comes in your typical nice and understanding flavor and then the cold and sociopathic. You will love some people and despise others. Not unlike other job atmospheres from what I've heard. Overall the job wasn't bad but there was no advancement and the day to day became so monotonous. The human brain can only handle so much of that. Working in the garden center (as a sales floor associate) was probably about as autonomous as anyone can get.

Wonderful place with right management,I loved working for Walmart until the new management team was hired. I worked there for 2 years and would have been longer if management would listen to the employees. The new management team they hired were bosses not managers. The difference between a boss and a manager is; a boss tells you what to do where a manager teaches you and help you grow. The managers are so scared of being replaced that they don't want to teach the employees the things they know. There were a select few that knew the more the dedicated employees know the easier their job. Advancement opportunities are obtainable.,4,Former Employee,Bakery Department Manager ,"Jacksonville, FL",12/17/12,2012,12,17

And after a while I begin to feel like it was, thats all my managers thought I was good for. However with a considerate mind I knew they loved how great I was at what I did as far as customer service and knew I was the strongest amungst the rest of the elderly door greeters so I knew thats why they wanted me to stay. I accepted that. But I didnt accept that if they knew I was great why wouldnt they move me to another position with better pay. ahhhh haa then I get it. It was all about money not the value of who I was as a person and what my capabilitys were.

A decent if not Bi-polar place to work.,"A typical day would involve clocking in, checking the bays at the front of the store to make sure they were filled with carts for customers, then you would proceed out into the parking lot and begin rounding up stray carts that had been left outside of cart corrals by customers or bringing the carts in the corrals up to the bays. The management would go between the extremes of ignoring the existence of the cart pushers to yelling about how terrible the parking lot looked regardless of the efforts of the employee(s) with demands that it be cleared within 30-45 minutes.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Cart Pusher ,"Ashland, KY",12/16/12,2012,12,16

Interesting business startigy realy...,"Cut wages across the bored and bring down the American standard of living while allowing few at the top to make absorbent amounts of money. Then convenience the public that it's all for the better of there community, that it will provide ""jobs"" (I use that term very loosely, because jobs usually imply pay; and here, pay is nowhere near the living standard for most employees). After convincing the people that this business is for the betterment of the community, force the locals to pay for the building of a facility through he use of their tax revenue's.The employees are paid so little they most rely on food stamps, then the community pays out in tax revenue to compensate for the food stamps.Utilize poor training and a very flat management structure that has little room for promotion (for the idiots who wish to be promoted). And for the ones that do seek out there own training (through college) under no circumstances help them out (for this plan to work there must be a very oblivious community).So there it is, really a good idea, make people pay more in taxes for something that is actually detrimental to the economics of the local community (everyone knows Wal Mart runs out small business's which contributes to a diminishing middle class).

Though my job wasn't glamorous, I learned a great deal about how to manage a large crew of peoples with little time to do so along with my own job demands.My managers were mostly horrible, from their inability to communicate the wants and needs to their poor education on what a good manager was. They managed by fear, not by respect.My co-workers and subordinates were wonderful people. Most were hard working, those that were not often found themselves regretting the decision to work under me, as I pushed productivity like no other to make everyone's job a bit easier.What I enjoyed most was the people, that I could feel comfortable with both my co-workers and subordinates.

Great benefits but not so good as a job..,"Don't pay attention to your job description because you will never stay within it. They will have you doing anything and everything. The pay is so low at this job that it is barely enough to survive and they never give raises, if they do it's only like 40 cents or something cheap like that. They do not allow any over time whatsoever. Good luck trying to get a day off that you request, but they will always get you to switch your schedule to work on your day off. They do not allow you to call out no matter what. Even if you're dying in the hospital, they will still consider that an unexcused absence. Most of the co-workers are really nice but the management are always power tripping and they are very fake, they talk and act like they are your friend but then they'll turn their back on you in a second.

There's a reason that this company has the image it does...,"Overall I enjoy the retail environment and love working to help customers. I have only been with the company for a short time but with the other retail companies I have worked for, I am not impressed with WalMart. I'm not the best but I do take a lot of pride in myself and my capabilities to do my job but this company revolves through employees so fast that they don't seem to notice talent or care about the way their employees are treated or how the store looks to the customer. As a consumer myself I will not go down an aisle or finish shopping in a store that is disorganized and understaffed. They claim they are flexible with hours but I have not had any manager interested in working with me on my scheduling. They really, in my opinion, need to work on keeping employees that are retail and customer oriented and take care of those employees.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Thornton, CO",12/15/12,2012,12,15
It was an interesting job,I loved working for Wal-Mart. I felt safe when I worked there. They gave me an opportunity to better my self and my family.

A Good Starting Point To Learn and Grow,"My experience at Wal-Mart has been a unique one. I appreciate the lessons, on the clock and off, that I've learned with this company. Though I'm ready to move on, working at Wal-Mart has taught me more responsibility, the ability to multitask a little better, and the advantages of growing close and successful relationships with people. I've learned how to deal with the pressures of heavy workloads and finishing tasks in timely manner. My relationships with higher management was a definite pro in my experience at Wal-Mart. I was able to talk with them freely and often regarding issues, suggestions, etc that would make Wal-Mart a better place. That would have to be my most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was working with so many people ( employees, customers) and dealing with those different personalities and expectations.

A typical day at work was clocking in at start time and stocking shelves until clock-out time. My co-workers were like family; we helped each other as a team.

Walmart DC is horrible as usual,I worked at the DC in cleburne for over a year. I worked 4 day work weeks and absolutely hated every minute of it. There is a lot of favortism and double standards. Needless to say i quit the insurance sucks and i do not recommend. While i was there we worked 10hr shifts if your were lucky mostly it was like 8 hours and you received 2 20 minute breaks and are always being watched and nit picked at for the littlest things. This company at one point was great to work for but after Mr. Walton died its about production and money money money they will cut your hours just to make a quick dime. They offer people lowers prices in stores by shafting there employees for it. Be prepared if you go it has a high turnover rate mainly because people find out how horrible it is. They pay high to make up for the hours they cut you dont be fooled if your intentions are to go there and work overtime and make bank your sadly mistaken you can work OT and then they will send you home the next day to cut it.,1,Former Employee,Lift Driver Order Filler ,Cleburne,12/14/12,2012,12,14

Over worked and under staffed.,"I have been with Walmart for 7 years and most of that time has been at the customer service desk. When working the service desk you are dealing with alot of different customers. So you need the ability to adapt with each new person. You really dont have to have any regard to policeys and rules as they will be thrown out the window the secound a customer starts to get loud. Once that happens they will get what they want and maybe even a gift card for the time.Now as managmet goes you better have a hard shell cause most of them have not a clue what there devistion is doing. Some are runnign things like a boot camp and you dont get pull ups as punishment you get a cut in hours or very bad hours meaning work supper late one day and then turn around and come in supper early the next.Other associates? well some work well and do the job that is required. Others do nothing at all. It seems the ones that do nothing and talk all day are the ones that get the good treatment. Those of us that work and work hard get steped on all the way around.This is not a job for a family person or one that is in need of a decent job as you will not get hours, schedule, benefits, or pay that is requried to be a mom or dad.

And seeing someone come in the store hungry that didn't have money to get all they needed to support their family. Because we couldn't help everyone. With the team I worked with we did our best not to turn away many. My co- workers were like family.

Hard working job without a lot of reward,"My typical day at work is long and very strenuous. I working in the frozen department so I usually get around 6-8 pallets a night. I love that Wal-Mart keeps their employees around but management does not attend to those who do not work hard. The ones who do work hard continuously work harder every night to make up for the lack of help of others. From experience, the management at my particular store do not follow through with complaints or concerns and are more concerned with the work being DONE rather than HOW and WHO did all the work. This is unfair to the said worker who is working twice as hard. Also raises are less than spectacular and every year something else changes that affects what little bonuses we get as well as our hours we can or cannot work.I work hard and love some of the people I work with, this is what keeps me going.

The Management is incompetent and self centered I don't know how anything ever gets done. 3. Finely, they make a billion dollars or so profit every year so why don't they pay their employees better?

"Wal-Mart is a good place to work if you don't want to advance in your career, and have pretty thick skin.","I have worked for this company on third shift for about a few years and in that time I have not advanced in the least. I still do the same job now that I did when I started. It's funny because I work really hard, yet I get nowhere. My raises aren't anything to write home about. I am overlooked for positions that I apply for. Then those same people who I observed chatting away hour after hour with other employees, and hobnobbing with the managers . . . Yes, they received the promotions and higher raises and always worked the easiest departments with a lot of assigned help. Hard work is not rewarded here. The managers can be bullies too.They will milk you for all you're worth and then throw you away.If you need money, it's better than factory work but not by much. A lot of the time the managers are basically expecting the same amount that you would put in at a factory. But they want you to do it in spite of all the things that work against it in the store environment. You can't run pallets from the backroom to the sales floor because there are customers who may be turning the corner at any second, and if a bottle of shampoo spills . . . you gotta make sure it gets cleaned up. A lot of things go wrong. What if a customer needs a carry-out? Or just doesn't stop talking, or needs a lot of assistance? Well, this takes away from your time (and you are timed, too) and works against you. They want a factory pace, but you can't deliver that when there are customers and many other tasks to do.They want the task to be out of your reach. It's so they can get the most out of you.

I've learned that no matter how bad things get, they always get worse before they get better.Management treats their employees like slaves for the most part. I've only met one manager out of about 30 who was agreeable.Co-Workers came from all walks of life, but most were full of themselves. Like any job there's always that one guy that'll get on your nerves, but poor training makes them difficult to work with.Hardest part of the job is dealing with everything your expected to do in such a short time and then not getting recognized for it when you get it done on time.There is nothing enjoyable about this line of work.",1,Current Employee,Overnight Receiving Associate ,"Longview, Wa",12/9/12,2012,12,9

Acting as if we were below their kindness/respect. The co-workers were great people. Most of them hard-working and fun to be around. The hardest part was the physical aspect, which wasn't really hard. In general it was pretty easy work.

It was fun working with customers and helping them in every way that I could possible.,"A typical day at Wal-mart is clocking in, then going to my department and begin to first either help customers if there are any then begin to straighten up the dept. from what the other shift left. I would do price changes, returns, zone, answer phones, and answer customers questions as well as check them out. What I have learned is to do price changes, manage associates, do management responsibly s like order items to restock the shelves. My co-workers were awesome to work with and I had to help train some of them which was a pleasure in doing so. The hardest part of my job was dealing with black Friday crowds and their demands. That was rough. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the cool new items that was available in our department.

"fun place to work, make you feel like family your first day on job","Started as a cashier and after about six months went to work in the pharmacy where I helped people with accepting their prescriptions, submitting them to be filled, filling the prescriptions, and cashing people out, also helped people with insurance problems. The overall management of Wal-Mart is great if there is a problem they help to make sure it gets taken care of. My co-workers were great to work with it like one big giant family. The hardest part was when the conflict with the manager of the pharmacy started. He was giving a girl that started after I did more hours, and more perference over job duties in the pharmacy. She was not as competent as I was at the job, I was a person that if something needed to be done then I would do it without being asked, this other girl would not even help put away the med order when it came in. To this day they still flirt and carry, it is not uncommon to go in there and see the two with their heads together talking and laughing and this kind of behavior is not allowed at Wal-Mart I enjoyed my job until this problem arised then I transferred out of the pharmacy and only worked for a couple of weeks as an assembler as there was no other job opening or I would probably still be there.",5,Former Employee,Pharmacy Clerk ,"Malone, NY",12/7/12,2012,12,7

Difficult environment with conflicting agendas,"A typical day included straightening/stocking shelves, running a cash register, restocking returns, and filling out theft slips for empty packages found. I would say I learned what hard work is, and compassion for the retail worker. Each manager had their own agendas and would often give conflicting assignments, all which had to be done before the end of your shift. All of my co-workers were kind and down to earth people. The hardest part of the job was completing all task by the end of my shift, as no overtime was aloud.

Great Company Horrible Management,"I don't know if the whole company is structured the same but the location i am currently employed at has the worst management team ever. Not all of the management is incompetent, but the most important ones are. They have people in positions of management that have no experience in merchandising, or the use of wearable computer (i.e. Telxon, Scanners). You know its bad when lower ranking associates are showing higher ranking associates how to operate basic functions of the company.

Run.....,Wal-Mart USED to be an ok company to work for but now the corporation just figures out ways to cut hours and not to pay their employees for a 40 hour week.

"Some friendly staff, some good teamwork, and knowledgeable staff.","I thought that my job at Walmart was similar to my job at Publix because they were both deli jobs. I knew almost everything about the job very soon because of my previous experience. The typical day at work consisted of mainly helping customers(serving them lunch meat and cheese, chicken, salads, etc.), cleaning the deli(wiping the slicers down, sweeping, cleaning the rotisserie machine, friers, hot case, doing dishes, etc.), frying chicken, and various other foods. I also had to take garbage down to the back to the trash compactor. I didn't learn much at Walmart because it was so similar to Publix. I learned how to prepare the salad case at Walmart. Some of the management was nice, but some didn't really seem to want to help. Many of my co-workers were nice, but some of them would disappear and then I would be left alone. The hardest part of the job was working by myself. The job wasn't really too hard, but it required more than one to two people doing job. I couldn't help all of the customers and clean at the same time, so the teamwork really helped, whenever it happened. I always did my job and I would never disappear. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the people that I worked with. I really enjoyed the teamwork because when teamwork happened the whole job is able to be done. The customers are able to be helped as soon as possible and all of the necessary cleaning can be done.",2,Former Employee,Deli Associate- Job ,"Jacksonville, FL",12/5/12,2012,12,5

Love the people but experience not the best,"The co-workers for the most part are great people. Management favors people who don't work consistently and if you do work then more and more is expected of you. Benefits are not great and if you are part time, which is all they generally hire now, then benefits are meager. They took away almost every holiday to be home with family. I am in customer service and usually by myself, which makes no sense in the holiday season. There is no consistency within management, one person says one thing and the next changes it. I learned that if you kiss up to management you can get whatever you want and if you work then expect to do it continually by yourself whether or not you need help. The hardest part is the hours. There is flexibility for some associates but not all. I enjoy my repeat customers and most of my co-workers.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,CA,12/5/12,2012,12,5

Hard to work at,Get to work and have to help unload the truck because we were short staffed. After had to go and stock whatever dept. we are assigned usually with little help again because we were always short staffed. Management expected miracles and when it wasn't done to their liking we would get written up for things beyond our control. I was always given the slower workers because i never complained and always picked up their slack. The hardest part was that I don't like to fail and it felt like that was all that i did. The best part of the job though was that since we were short staffed I got to learn many aspects of different jobs and was never bored or without anything new and different to do.,1,Former Employee,Stocker/ Cashier ,"Odessa, TX",12/4/12,2012,12,4

I loved my job as a cashier for third shift. My nights always went by smooth when it came to doing my job. The hardest part of my job was not having anything to, when you're the only cashier upfront it gets a little boring.

My co-workers where like family and we helped each other if ever there was a problem or question. I was always willing to fill in my other co-workers with things they would miss at meetings.

Productive but Not a Good work environment,I always had something to be working on but if one manager tells you to do something then another will come behind them and tell you to do something different. It was hard to stay on one task because management didn't work together to inform one or the other who was working on what. I worked 5am to 2pm i was classified as a part time associate but i was working full-time hours. I tryed to get my schedule changed because i had no one to help me take my daughter to school so i needed to come in at 7am and my manager told me she could not do that. thats a few of the hardest parts of my job because when i started working there they told me there a flexable with hours for parttime employes and thats what i was. The most enjoyable part was the people i worked with in the bakery i became close some of them but others did not like me.,1,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Denton, TX",12/4/12,2012,12,4

Management at our store has just transferred to a new young leader. She also moved from the state of Colorado and so far she has done everything in her power to make the rest of the management team, and our store, simply unstoppable. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers who deliberately try and bring your day down, but I never let them overpower my happiness.

Sales people were in charge of keeping their departments clean, stocked, and helping customers when needed. Learned much about customer service in this job. As with all jobs, co-workers had some good people and some bad people. Most other cashiers were fun to be around and chat with, others were naturally quarrelsome, a few with personal issues.

IIt is a great lesson in time management. The management as a whole are very supportative and encouraging. The hardest part of my job would be very little recognition for the individual on a job well done. They thank us as a whole but fail to distinquish between the hard workers and the idle workers.

Great job to have.,Wal.Mart is a fun exciting place to work. The only down fall is the pay. I feel I was not acknowledged enough for the work i did. To be 19 and the only person working in grocery from 7-4 Monday through Friday not even a department manager it sucked to find out that i didn't get promoted because in they're words i wasn't assertive enough but for the past year Grocery exceeded in sales with no manager but little help from others.

I had many co-workers that always seemed angry and the management was never around when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the customers, and the hardest part was trying to find a manager.

Do not make as much money as needed to live.,"Cashiering is not a difficult job when someone teaches you correctly. Extensive customer service Is needed to work at Walmart. I learned for sure that everyone is different and need to be treated according to their personalities, within reason. Not all of the management is fair and you have to learn who you can and cannot trust, pretty much just like any other person in the world. The hardest part of the job is not offending someone.

Interesting work with poor management.,"A typical day at work for me would consist of answering customer questions, providing services, and stocking the shelves. Having this job has taught me a lot about ammunition & firearms and paint & color matching. I've also learned a lot about fishing and the Department of Natural Resources. Most of the management is mediocre here, however, there are a couple of assistants who actually help me and meet my needs as far as work goes. The most difficult part of this job would have to be, being asked questions about rifles and shotguns, seeing as I don't know much at all about that field. There is always something new to learn everyday. What I enjoy most about this job is mixing and working with paint.",3,Current Employee,Sporting Goods/Hardware/Automotive Sales Associate ,"Indian Land, SC",12/2/12,2012,12,2

A secure income in an unstable economy,A company that caters more to the bottom line and less to customers and associates.The average day is assisting customers mainly in the bicycle and sporting goods departments. I learned a lot of customer service and people skills working with so many different cultures and personality types. Completing tasks for managment inside or outside of department. Management needs more training than they are receiving. They don't seem to care about customer service really. They just like to make sure their notes are done. Priorties are different with every manager. There is no consistency. Coworkers are a great bunch of people. The hardest part of the job is being pulled off customer service to do something that can wait. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet people from all over the country and the world.

I learned that the workload and the pressure are much different on the client side of the business. The hardest part of the job for me was the workload and the short amount of time we had to turn around our product back to the consultants. My prior jobs had ben more laid back.

The most enjoyable part of the job was connected with management and coworkers and actually establishing friendships. A typical day for me was clocking going directly to my supervisor ask him is there anything he needed me to do before I find something that i know needed to be done because i had already learned the system and what was needed of me to do so i would take it upon myself at times to get work that i thought needed to be done. Overall Walmart for me was a great experience and it helped me grow as an all around associate.",4,Former Employee,Grocery Sales Associate ,"Grovetown, GA",11/29/12,2012,11,29

Job environment is okay but advancement and wages are poor,"A typical day at work usually involves working in multiple departments in a very fast paced environment. I work as a cashier, as a CSM, and at the service desk. As a cashier you help the customer throughout the checkout process via answering questions, processing money transactions, and using good customer service. As a CSM you support all the front end employees by helping deal with unhappy customers, answering employee questions about proper procedures on how to do things, managing breaks and lunches so they are not late, and bringing cash to registers when prompted. As a service desk employee you handle a wide range of customer transactions ranging from returns with or without a receipt, processing money orders, processing money transfers, processing bill payments, cashing checks, and sorting any returns into the proper bins. I have learned a wide range of skills that I can use in future jobs or in a higher level at my current store. My co-workers are all very nice and fun to work with. Management doesn't seem to be around all the time when you need them and tend to take quite awhile to get up to deal with unruly customers. The hardest part of the job is remembering all the policies and rules that have to be followed for every transaction.",3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Manager/Service Desk ,"Woodburn, Oregon",11/29/12,2012,11,29

High expectations without reasonable wages,"I am currently working at Wal-Mart part-time (30 hours per week) while attending school full-time. Working at Wal-Mart really doesn't take much skills and the jobs are fairly easy to understand and to catch unto. Although, they take advantage of this in regards to very little pay, and not allowing employees to work full-time. This in return brings in a lot of poor workers, which brings down the work experience for the ones whom come to work to actually work. The ones who actually work are counted on to pick up the slack of the ones who do not. The ones who do not work although do not last long, but are quickly replaced with a similar careless employee. In all, it is a pretty easy job, but it is definitely a job nothing more and should really be avoided if you take pride in your work, because it will be taken advantage of by desperate managers.",2,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Menomonee falls, WI",11/29/12,2012,11,29

I learned to be very careful where you were placed(anyone applying for the job, needs to research the job position extensively, to make sure that they can even perform it). Management really needs to take into consideration, that who they manage, look to them for leadership as well as kindness. My co-workers were on the same page, they were good chaps. Hardest part of the job, was EVERY DAY, quite grueling, but in years time I could breeze through the P90X workout like a boss.

Supercenter store that gets many interesting customers,"I love helping others, and to be able to work out a difficult situation with an aggravated customer and see how satisfied they are after I have resolved the issue they were informing me about, also getting customer's checked out to go quickly within their convenience. I learned how to bag items properly and operate register. My co-workers, like myself, were very easy to get along with, they helped when needed and always made the day g by smooth for all of us.

ICT Associate at Walmart,"Typical day at work consists of unloading 1-2 trucks on average, sorting freight, pulling pallets to salesfloor, and then picking if we get to it in time. I learned a lot about the inventory process and how to function as a key team memeber to get the job done quickly. Management at Walmart is pretty bad as far as stuff getting done when you need them, as well as the treatment of associates. I've found management often times will have us place pallets in 2 or 3 different locations, without using any logical reasoning on where these pallets should go. It causes us to do double the work and just wastes a lot of company time. Co-workers are like co-workers in any work place. Some are very dependable, while others are not. Pulling heavy grocery pallets to the sales floor would be the hardest part of the job as well as feeling rushed constantly. The most enjoyable part is working as a team together to get several goals accomplished in an 8 hour period.",2,Current Employee,Inventory Control Team Associate ,"Springfield, MO",11/28/12,2012,11,28

Management is generally fair, there were some managers that played favorites. One of the hardest things was when management wore their heart on their sleeve and took out their frustration on us, causing the whole store to be high strung and anxious. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers and the public. Some co-workers were extremely negative and didn't want to do much of anything except collect a paycheck.

I learned how to use a cart pusher and the importance of proper lifting. I never had much interaction with Management just seeing them out on the floor or in the back room. The hardest part of the job was defiantly being out in the cold at times my shoes would soak through from the snow or puddles. I liked being out side when it was nice. My co-workers were okay.

Walmart is,"Wal-Mart is a probably the best Retailer you can work at, if you’re looking for a long term career in retail. By far the best pay structure in its class, and job security is excellent if you do your job and not put yourself in a position where your ethic's, and integrity is called into question.* Most of management is former hourly associates who feel entitled.* Most Hourly associates are extremely disengaged.* Thief is rapid from customers to associate.* Documentation is key for survival for management.* Store Manager will always look for scapegoats to avoidTaking responsibilities of failures of proper direction. Store Managers are all always stress out.* Office Politics’ is something you will have to deal with once you get into management, for the simple fact that if you is a highly driven and passionate about your job, you are indirectly putting pressure on your peers to get out of their comfort zone to either work harder, or else risk looking bad. As a result, you have to make sure you build relationships earlier so you can avoid getting thrown under bus if one of project is not complete.* Work life Balance is slowly disappearing.* Unrealistic expectations with limited resources. In order to keep yourself from getting ""Coached"" DOCUMENT EVERYTHING!, Walmart is very sensitive to complaints and potential lawsuits.",3,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Saint Paul, MN",11/27/12,2012,11,27
Nice Beginner Job With Easy Advancement,"Walmart as a large company as it is has its share of good and bad's. A Typical day would include making sure prices are correct and the shelves are fully stock, Training is a 50/50, you learn on the job as you go and by talking to people but if you get a promotion your just get thrown in without an actual training course. The management team I would say are so-so, there are a few that really want you to succeed in your career and others like to talk down and treat you like you really are lower then them. The People of Walmart are a great group of people from the co-workers to the actual customers, The Hardest part would be when management and the company throw on a lot of daily and hourly task that are expected to be constantly completed and if you do not complete them it could lead to consequences ... The most enjoyable part i would say is when Walmart has parties and events to raise money for associate in need or volunteering projects.

good work culture,"Good mix of talent,i enjoy working at walmart.This application enables the WAL-MART associates to view their pay information for the current pay period and the pay period in the past.

Decent work with good management.,"Shortly after clocking into work, I applied sun lotion and strapped on my vest. I have one to two other associates assisting me. One would be using the electric cart machine with remote control to haul in large stacks of carts (up to 20 specifically). Hauling in carts was pretty much the entire eight hours of my shift. We would get the occasional call to do carry out service for a television set or household furniture. The title ""Courtesy Associate"" is very misleading, as ""Cart-Pusher"" is a more suitable description of this job as there is little contact with customers compared to previous jobs I've had. Management was fairly strict about lunch and clock-out times, but overall decent and friendly. All of my co-workers are friendly and I've never been given any trouble, since a cooperative, friendly environment is expected from every associate. The hardest part of the job isn't the physical labor, but rather the boredom that follows hauling in carts day in and day out. I've worked as courtesy positions before, but none required me to haul carts in for the full eight hours of work, just one to two hours worth. The most enjoyable part of this work is rather hard for me to fathom as there weren't many strong points keeping me tied to being a Courtesy Associate. I did however, appreciate being valued like a member of the team and very decent management.",3,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Pleasanton, CA",11/27/12,2012,11,27
Fun workplace,"I was young when I worked for Walmart, but we always had so much fun, there was never a dull moment in the Walmart life.

Fast paced and sometimes fun workplace,Very fast paced as I worked the night shift and had to stock items in a fast and timely manner. I learned how to deal with differing views and attitudes while also helping customers. Management were sometimes helpful but some chose to use obscenities or belittle employees if it was a hectic night or the job was not done in the exact time frame they wanted it done. The hardest part of the job was multi-tasking between helping customers and trying to stock items at the same time.

Personally I try to walk through the door of my employment choice and devote 100% every day. I also enjoy the customers and if I can help one that is not having such a great day and have them leave with a smile and a thank you it is all worthwhile. I think the hardest part of the job would be when it is really shorthanded and you are doing the work of 2, 3 or even 4 people at times. However it does tend to keep you busy and your day goes fast! I think the biggest downfall of Wal*Mart is that the healthcare plans are not very good. You don't have alot of options and wind up paying alot for very little.",4,Former Employee,OTC Pharmacy manager ,"Morgantown, WV",11/24/12,2012,11,24

Awful place to work,Walmart management doesn't take enough time to work one on one with their employers. They pick favorites and based upon that is how your scheduling/moving up is picked. I personally was fired because my grandmother was hospitalized in Dallas. I called in and talked personally to a manager who excused my absence. A WHOLE MONTH later I was called into the office and fired for that being 'to many call offs in three months' I had not called off again after my grandmothers hospitalization.

"Not for the educated, driven individual. Minimum wage, part-time only","We unload merchandise off of trucks onto pallets to be taken to the floor to be stocked. There are many,many bosses,,,,including many lifer associates who want very badly to be somebody but never will be. We are given too few workers to complete the trucks on time and when the manager shift changes we always hear ""How come you aren't done yet"", from the manager coming in. We are responsible for work that 3rd shift is suppose to do. We downstack multiple pallets worth of merchandise and have to pull very heavy pallets to the floor. When the dairy/frozen truck comes the employees from those depts rarely come to unload the truck. So, we have to stop our job to unload and bring their pallets of merch. to the fridges and freezers. Yet, we get no thank you's and get hammered for not being done with our work. This job pays minimum wage and is part-time only. You get poorer as the months go by. And, working with the people they make you work with makes you dumber. Run Forrest run. Or, never, never start working for WalMart in the first place.

I've mostly learned how to work with costumers because not all customers are happy. And my co-workers are OK i have a few close friends but most of them do not know how to work as a team. The most hardest part of the job is trying to please a costumer without violating the policy because some things customers want us to do we just cant do and that causes a lot of problems. And the most enjoyable part of the job is when the management shows their appreciation for all our hard work.,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Mechanicsville, VA",11/19/12,2012,11,19

Demanding work atmosphere with plenty of opportunity,"Walmart is, in my experience, a demanding but fulfilling place to work. There is a lot expected out of those who are employed there, but those that take their work seriously and are committed to serving the customer will find that there are tons of opportunities for advancement, as well as 100 percent job security.Pay doesn't start out as well as other employers, but annual pay raises are AVERAGE 50 cents/hr increase. Salaried positions offer great pay and bonuses. Hourly full and part time positions still qualify for quarterly bonuses based on sales and profit.Above all, I have found that Walmart is a very fair place to work. All employee concerns are taken into consideration and approached with tact and with respect for the individual. Racism, Sexism, etc. are complete non-issues in regards to employee treatment and advancement. Associates receive disciplinary action or praise depending on production, customer service, and adherance to rules, nothing else.It is a fast pace environment for just about every position in the building, with a guaranteed full work day for everyone. Inter-department help is commonplace. Not for those who can't handle frequent face to face interaction and a full work schedule with deadlines.Management has always been fair, practical, and approachable. They expect a lot out of the crews they oversee, but employ an open door policy; whatever concerns one might have, a manager will always have time to hear them out. Most managers I've been in contact with have also had a pretty relatable personality to them that made the workplace seem more friendly - more...",4,Current Employee,IMS Associate ,"Evendale, OH",11/16/12,2012,11,16

A Day At Wally World,It can be pretty hectic and that's only because everyone is not on the same page with things. I learned how to work the money center as far as sending/ receiving money grams and also cashing checks. The management needs to be improved. Most of the managers in my store are either related to the employees or really good friends with them which makes it a lot harder on the workers like myself. Its best to stay to yourself just go to work and do your part. Don't try to make friends because in the end you'll make enemies without even knowing it. The hardest part of the job is trying to follow proper procedure from one manager when the other said to do it a different way.

I also learned about merchandising and stocking the shelves. I learned how to work and fix registers how to catch fraudulent activities. I enjoyed my co-workers and management team. You can't succeed I believe without the help of your co-workers and managers. The hardest part would have to been our busiest times when everything seemed a little chaotic and I would have to keep it all together and make sure everything ran smoothly to make sure the customers were taken care of.

My days at walmart,Working for Walmart was great before I got accumluated with everything and learned how the system worked or my department I should say. The daytime workers in my department are told to not to bring any freight back to the back so they just put it any where they find space and when I come at night to stock nothing is where it belongs so it cuts into my stocking time. When management was informed they did nothing to help sovle this problem simply because it would result in more work for them. Co-workers were very helpful but a few were rude.

I pretty much learned somthing every day been on the sales floor,or even in the back rooms. I worked with some great CO- Workers we work together an hard everyday to make one another job easy. The hardest part of the job was taking a break we had to take breaks every two hours or we would get in trouble. I didn't like stopping what i was doing with out finshing before break time.

Walmart has good benifits and associates are encouraged to have fun and submit new ideas,"I supervised associates that were a part of an assembly line and in quality control. I balanced work load to associates needed to accomplish our goals. The hardest part of the job was sending associates home when the workload was light.

"Loved my coworkers and customers, management, not so much.","As a fitting room associate, it is very hard to complete my job when the managers don't take the time to answer a phone call from another associate or an upset customer. I resigned because I asked for four hours less than what they continuously scheduled me for part time. I needed less hours for my daughter, as I am currently the only parent she has at home. Her father is deployed. A typical day at work consisted of answering the phones, cleaning the fitting rooms, zoning the intimates, and helping customers. My co-workers were amazing and very helpful. Management, as I stated above, made it hard for me to succesfully complete my job and did not work with me on my hours. The hardest part of my job was standing behind the desk for most of the day and having to repeatedly ask for somebody to pick up a phone.

Great work environment,"My day would start by me coming in either at 5 or 6 am. I would grab an hand held terminal and printer for the day and go to my department being the meat department. First thing I had to do was go through all of the fresh product and pull out all the product with old dates while marking down prices on product that had dates for the next day so we could sell them faster. So for example if today's date was 11/12/12 and the product had that same date I would have to pull it off the shelf. Now if the product had the tomorrows date of 11/13/12 I would have to mark it down with the hand held and print a new price tag for it. After I was done with that I would come back and start with the ham section and fill the product. I would then go to the brats, then beef, and etc. After I was done filling I would bin meat product that came in that morning. After that was done I would take all the product that I had pulled in the morning and using the hand held I would scan each item to be taken out of the system to correct the inventory numbers and then throw way all or some of the bad product. Some of the product, if good, would then be donated to charities. So in all my job was very easy and not really hard at all. My co-workers were great and my manager was great as well.",4,Former Employee,Meat Sales Associate ,"Monona, WI",11/12/12,2012,11,12

I have learned that I can not do it all, without the support of the company and my co-workers. The most enjoyable parts of the job are my fellow co-workers and my customers.

Walmart great begining,Wal-mart was one of my first jobs and a great place to work. The management staff was pretty good about placing employees and helping with my set goals at the time with minor exception. The hardest part of the job would be not knowing what I would consistantly be doing as I was trained for most departments through out the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the family atmosphere the team created.,5,Former Employee,Supervisor Kerry Gafford ,PLANT CITY FL,11/12/12,2012,11,12
Recieving area that isnt very spacious to work sometimes,"A typical day starts with setting up the floor with pallets for the freight that is about to be unloaded. I didn't really learn much because I have warehouse knowledge and assist a career class about it. The one thing I learned, I would say is how a big company is operated day to day. I work along with some of the best co-workers I know. We can joke around but get our work done correctly. Management on the other hand isn't that great unless you count 5 out of the 12 or 13 that are there. The hardest part I would have to say about my job there would be knowing how much more I could make at another company for my experiences. Now for the most enjoyable part or parts of working for this company would be my co-workers in the receiving area and break time.",1,Current Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Glenolden, PA",11/12/12,2012,11,12

Wal-mart,"I worked there for ten years. I loved my customers and the people I worked with but things changed for the worst while I was there. It went from one person in each department closing at night to one person for 3 or 4 departments while they pull you to the register all night. You are held accountable for your area when what you were supposed to do wasn't done because they told you to do other tasks instead.. Because you were scheduled 8 hours out of which 1 hour is lunch, 1 hour was in foods, 5 hours were on register, and If you were lucky you were in your area the rest of your shift. They don't hire full time anymore just part timers.",2,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Round Lake Beach, IL",11/12/12,2012,11,12
"Great co-workers, not so great advancement opportunities.",I learned a great many things while working at Wal-Mart. I learned how to be a manager and how to coordinate a team of people and allocate a pool of resources effectively to get the job done as efficiently as possible. It was always difficult to move up in the company as the store manager's friends almost always had first shot and the interview process was mostly a show. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with angry customers that look down on you just because of where you happen to work.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"McKinney, TX",11/12/12,2012,11,12

Additional tasks may also be assigned by managers on duty such as , stocking the sales floor , maintenance around store , help unload truck in the receiving department , move pallets from receiving to sales floor with pallet jack & stacking boxes on pallets. I do enjoy the sometimes fast pace work environment on busy days although it may be the hardest part when other associates aren't scheduled the same day to keep up the pace with the constant customer service.

Drastically-cut Work Hours,"As a Sales Associate, you are expected to zone each aisle first thing upon starting shift, then do return carts while still zoning as you go. Assistant Manager tells you to finish an over-flowing cart with everything on it belonging to 7 different aisles in 20 minutes. They expect you to be superhuman to be able to do this. I do like my job, it's nice to chat with customers and being able to help them with what merchandise they are looking for and the co-workers are very nice. The hardest part was, in a typical week, I used to be given 32 work hours but then suddenly, a year and 4 mos later, everything drastically changed, they started giving me 4 hours one week, 8 the next, 15 the following week and is on-going at about 16 hours a week, not even reaching 24 hours in a week. My supervisor told me I have to change my availability in order to restore those hours I am losing. I dont drive and I cant afford to buy a car, so I have to contend with these slashed hours until I find another job, which I hope and pray will be soon. Funny how you do your best at work, get glowing praises for the job you do, even received an ""Exceeds Expectations"" on the annual employee review, yet gets rewarded with a measly 4-hour to 16-hour a week schedule without being informed as to why your hours were cut or what you did or didn't do to deserve it.",1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,Upstate NY,11/10/12,2012,11,10

Managers just didn't seem to care,"The managers would routinely intentionally understaff departments to cut costs, leaving the associates who were there to struggle with trying to assist customers with products that they have no knowledge of. The coworkers were mostly a joy to work with, but management seemed to be self-absorbed. The benefits were above average and got better for those who stayed with the company for many years, but too many associates got burnt out due to the fact that they were always feeling like they were being pulled many different ways to make up for the incompetence of management. At one point, the turnover rate at my store was over 60%, so they had to effectively hire 3 people for each position just to find one who would stay. The hardest part of the job was the fact that there were many days that I could never get a break until I clocked out for lunch/end of shift due to the fact that, at the time, noone else could do my job. The best part of the job was the people, both coworkers and customers.

Of course there is always going to be break room gossipe. It just always feels like when I go to work that its just one big highschool no one is being perfesstional just wanting to come and do there job and work and leave. Since its work not a soscial gathering.Also I just know now that the management really doesen't care about the employee what so ever. Even if they gave us rules to fallow we would offten have to break them because the managment said so. You never got snaps for doing something good, your flaws were always pointed out. Well I suppose sometimes we'd get a pat on the back.Most of the time The managers never really knew what was going on with their employees.

A last resort,After failing and failing to find a job out of highschool I was forced to work for this company. I will say the other employees can be some of the nicest people you can meet. However the management and pay are some of the worst in existence.

The other co-workers were nice and helpful.,"I was hesitant about other people's reviews when I started working- even those who trained me were concerned about why I would apply there compared to anywhere else. My co-workers were nice enough and we tried helping each other when it was needed. It was stressful having to run even the slightest command through to a manager because the system they use is only run by one person. So on a busy day, it could take up to 20 mins to just get a confirmation to re-print a receipt. That would have to be the hardest part about the job. I enjoyed helping people who came in or getting the person they needed if I could not help- I enjoyed my work very much until management stepped in. Many/almost all the management staff did not know how to run a register so they did not know the importance or hard parts of certain things. When we would get swamped they would all stand around the front and watch because they did not want to take the time to learn how to run one in order to help.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Lexington, VA",11/5/12,2012,11,5

Horrible place to work!,A typical day a Wal Mart will be; you coming to work at one time for one department to do one job and the managers have doing the job of two workers. They cut hours all the time to avoid paying out extra money. They will schedule one person to do two people jobs. They keep the trach compactor locked and hate to unlock it when you call for the key. When a member of your family pass and you call in; they write you up. They have no respect at all for anyone or any emergency they may have. The co-workers are the only thing that gets you by at Wal Mart. the hardest part of the job is actually going to work. The only thing I learned from working at Wal Mart is how to decorate cakes and bake bread. In which I honestly taught myself by watching others. No one actually show you how to do anything there.

Challenging work environment with unattainable standards and goals,"Working here was certainly a challenge in a few different ways. The work itself was easy and simple, but being a big corporation, the company has strict guidelines and goals that seem to be unattainable unless you work at a store that never gets busy and work with people who have your same work ethic. I especially had issues with my immediate supervisor, who really did not help me learn the processes and duties of the position at all, even though I directly asked her if she could assist me. My co-workers had all worked there for 6 or more months, and seemed to be in a groove and had no time to train someone new. I basically learned the job on my own through trial-and-error because I had no other options. I even went to upper management with concerns and although they did listen to me with open ears, nothing ever came about it. Once I learned exactly what I needed to do to correctly perform this job, it was somewhat enjoyable, because it really is a simple and easy job. I loved helping customers, and they really seemed to appreciate my help, because not everyone who works at such a big store is willing to go above and beyond for a customer.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Muskogee, OK",11/4/12,2012,11,4

"Very Diverse Workforce, But Poor Management","Given the nature of the business, specifically in my department, the daily routine is just that - routine - except for the variation in customers and customer requests and attitudes. Very seldom are there any learning opportunities, since you are expected to know or learn on your own, most of the necessary automotive knowledge. Management is at best adequate, but not readily helpful, knowledgeable or sensitive. The best part of the job are my coworkers, a very funny and diverse group of guys. The hardest part of the job is having to be on your feet all day and handling the work of at least three people, while dealing with the attitudes of customers and the inadequacy of management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the thanks and admiration I receive from customers and my fellow coworkers for handling and resolving a difficult situation well.",2,Current Employee,TLE SERVICE WRITER ,"East Windsor, NJ",11/3/12,2012,11,3

My coworkers were very respectful and it was easy to coordinate work hours and dept. inventory with them. The training is done hand on, on the job. I worked very hard and learn almost everything on my own. The middle management changed all the time and it was hard to keep up with who was who. Problems with refrigeration and things like broken shelves or lack of carts to pull the product into the floor was very hard to resolve or get any action done. I think the main problem was that the top management all changed and they were also learning on the job.

Amazing oppertunities,"This position was very valuable in my growth as a manager, it helped me be able to discover many techniques to help improve my associates and my team. A typical day is coming in and forming a plan to tackle the tasks of the day, which in a typical store setup was to ensure the merchandise was correctly set to company program and filled to capacity. Also arrangements had to be made to communicate with the overnight shift to be able to make the major moves of departments and areas of construction. If assigned to the day shift I would make plans on where and how to move the merchandise counters to make for an efficient and customer friendly environment, if on the overnight shift I would be doing the actual moves with my associates in a timely manner in order to have everything set to ensure success on the next shift.This job has many perks including travel, which is also one of the down falls as I was expected to travel up to 300 days a year.Traveling with a small group of 7 means you get very close to your coworkers and manager essentially making them your family. Most of the time it makes for a very close knit group working toward the same goals and can make the job very simple if you know you can rely on everyone to complete their assigned tasks.",4,Current Employee,Field Project Supervisor ,United States,10/30/12,2012,10,30

"Decent place to work, but almost impossible to move up.","I have been working at walmart for almost 2 and a 1/2 years, not only am I still only making 8.65/hr but it is also almost impossible to move up in the company. A typical day at work for me would be to work on freight, and make sure things are straightened up. Along with being treated like a child by my department manager, who doesn't know how to be a manager. I've learned quite a bit working at Walmart, but unless I planned on moving to another Walmart, the things I've learned I couldn't take with me anywhere else.Most of the managment at Walmart is very helpful, and they know how to do their job. However, our new store manager who is supposed to be the main person out on the floor and checking on his employees is usually the one hiding in the back in his office, not knowing how to do his job. The only hard part about my job is when I get busy and can't take care of everyone as quickly as I would like, and I end up with upset customers when I can't do anything about it. As far as enjoyable goes, it would have to be when I get customers that make me smile and laugh, then it makes my day go by a lot better than I thought it would.All in all, I really want to get out of Walmart.

If there is a problem of how do set display, you can go to another co-worker to help with suggestions. Even a problem with another associate/management, you can go to another member of management. The hardest part of my job is no associate help and not enough time in the day to get everything you want done. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team work everyone has.

I find the trickle down effect most challenging-its when you can work your hardest with a sense of urgency and feel like youre making a difference when you leave the job but when you return to work you will find there will be some not working towards the same goal as you are.

"It is a place with great people, but seriously lacks staffing which makes the workplace awful.","Everyday you are constantly trying to do the same thing and there is never time to perfect any aspect in our buisness. The lack of associates leaves of with freight that doesnt get worked from our truck deliveries. This causes our backroom to be full constantly. My job is to manage the backroom and everyday I attempt to clear it up little by little. Any area I clear in the backroom just gets filled the next day. So its constantly a daily battle for the same thing. The management team is good at giving direction but really doesn't do alot of physical work to help the store.

Prices or Customers?,"The whole employment with Walmart wasnt a total bust, but some things arent what they seem to be. Management tells you when you start that the customer is number one priority, but I really dont believe that is the case. I think that the Walmart system is built around prices and not customer satisfaction. They preach and preach about helping the customer but all they are concerned with is the actual purchase and NOT the customer as they so tell you. They have these lessons on the computer that are supposed to help you better learn the area and job you are in but the reality of it is that everyone and I mean everyone copies and cheats just so they dont have to sit and go through all the lessons because the actual lessons really and truly do not have hardly anything to do with what you are working on. Sure there are some key points that the lessons have but overall they will not make you smarter nor will they allow you to have more knowledge in the future to help customers who are in need of knowing specifics about a product. As far as benefits and pay I would say that benefits are above average and the pay is right around normal for the area that Walmart is in. The managers are all different in their style so I cannot say as a whole Walmart is horrible on management but I can say that they could give the managers alot more training on how to actually treat the employees instead of treating them like just another body like some managers do. I just believe that Walmart has changed from being customer friendly to profit friendly...",3,Former Employee,Sporting Goods Associate ,"Dothan, AL",10/26/12,2012,10,26

It was a great work place becuase they continuously asked me to do things that werent in my job description but it kept me very busy and that is something that enjoyed. The work place was great and i ot along with every employee. The hardest part of the job is when my register lines would get very long and another cashier would take my next customer. As an employee I like to get everything done that s given to me. Even though I know that it will benefit the customer to go to anothe register I still didn't like it on my part that I wasn't fast enough.

productive Job,"I really enjoy the work I do. I Started off as an full time remold associate. I was in the remold team from Feb to May last year. It was alot of fun, getting to know your team player's and Mgr. Also it was a lot of pain,because my assistant would always give me the hard tasks and give everyone else the easy one. that I completely did not like at all. But I've seen to have gotten through the rough tasks. And the reason why they did that too me is because when it comes to work, I take pride and very demanding of my job. Once Walmart hired me from the remold team I got replaced as a cashier, that I wasn't happy with. I was pushing for the working overnight's. So I was stuck with that position for 6 long months and also while being a day cashier I kept fighting for the overnight position. I wasn't going to let anyone or anything step into my way from backing down in the company of were i know for fact that i'm gonna be happy that I took the overnight position. Now that I'm working full time as an overnight GM stock ( Cosmetic) area I enjoy the night life. Why? Because everyone treats each other like family, having loving and caring management team 100% but that's only for overnights and also I like the fact I can think straight while working, help with customer's and train other co-workers. SO far in this company I learn to meet my times of when live freight has to be done, learn how to bin the merchindise, set lable, building mods and features. I love and take pride of my job every single night that I work.",5,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Henrietta, NY",10/26/12,2012,10,26

What I learned at walmart is that a working place can be pleasant ,even if you have to work hard to finish the job assigned .As I said above my co-workers at walmart were great to work with !

Managers and higher, therefore living off of 30 hours is a requirement. I do say I enjoy my job for the people. I am a people person and serve my customers with the highest ability I can.

Disappointing and unconcerned,While I worked at walmart I recieved nothing but attitude and slander. Some management were very nice and respectful especially when I found out I was terminally ill. On some of the nights I worked I would be given the toughest job to do and only a certain amount of time to do it. This company does not care about anything when it comes to their employees. I was fired for medical reasons and when I filed suit they lied and said it was due to attendance even though I displayed all required documentation.

5 Years of fun with mostly good management.,"The job was easy enough, you put freight on shelves, meet times given, do what you're expected to. The only complaints I could have for the work-place was the generalized customer competence and hatefulness, and also the generally poor methods of advancement for management. Every person I saw promoted only received promotion through brown-nosing, and held no qualifications for being where they were. The most successful days were generally those where the management made as few decisions as possible.Co-workers were fantastic! While every job has their single really, really dumb person, and their share of people who hate their lives...the personalities always seemed to mesh well, and made for a comfortable environment to work for the 5 years I did. I literally did everything in the store available to a non-salaried employee, and I can't say there was anything difficult about the job. Ignoring the unqualified management and occasional horrid customer, the job was just a blast to work.

Typical Cashier Job,"This was just a seasonal job, I just rang customers up at the cash register",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,Maryville Tn,10/23/12,2012,10,23
"Week Schedule, timeline,","A typical day of work is composed in different task. I divided in morning and afternoon task. Normally every Monday we check inventory to see the behaviour after the weekend and compared high and low inventory, special events, organization short meetings, lead times,scheduling and so on. The rest of the week continue monitoring the inventory, contact and coordinating meeting with suppliers via conference calls or in location to discuss different strategies or opportunities of business. I learned and develop comunications skills, and the most important to any job; the team work, especially know that the company is one, never is divided in me only or in my team only. The management is very important to follow up the time use of each employee because all is divided by day. Daily the co-worker is like a family but within the concept of work because I work with the rest of my team or division to increase the business and find the best solution of any opportunity.

I would answer thier questions and ask them if they were interested in applying for a Walmart Credit Card. I learned a lot of information on how to treat customers like family and I learned a lot of produce numbers so as to ring them up. I made a lot of friends by working with the other employees over the years at Walmart. The hardest part for me was trying to stay awake late nights.

Some of the management at my store are very supportive others are not which is typical of any job. I love most of coworkers and worked very well as a team with them. The hardest part of my job would be feeling like I didn't completely succeed at doing the best job I could.

There was never a day that went by that I didn't laugh thanks to them. They have been there for me through so much. Most days there really wasn't hard part, just frustrating when the customers got mad at us, the associates on the inside for something that the TLE Crew in the shop did or didn't do to there vehicles.

Once an owner of my own business, they were too strict about making us take breaks and ""working to rule"".

Also its always a learning experience either finding out how to perform specific task inside the office or dealing with customers in good and bad situations.

Did not enjoy job. Not worth the time,"Wal-mart starts you off with an extremely low pay rate. Usually barely over minimum wage, maybe a dollar (assuming you don't really have any relevant work history. Still not typically paid well even if you do.) if you're lucky. The work isn't always very difficult, but the time you spend working there isn't worth it.Your workload is too much and the pay isn't even close to proportional. I was a department manager and they wanted to pay me 9 dollars an hour to manage 4 departments (two, MAYBE three would be reasonable depending on what departments they are).Walmart offers standard 40 cent raises for average performance and 50 cent raises for going above and beyond every year, and reaching that performance goal isn't worth your time for that extra ten cents. Assuming you got your 50 cent raise for five years, you would be ahead two dollars and fifty cents in five years. I don't know about anyone else, but I feel like I could pull in more than that with a job that provided merit raises, which wal-mart does not allow.",1,Current Employee,Inventory Management Specialist ,"Lincoln, NE",10/22/12,2012,10,22

Good crew to work with,"I loved the crew that I worked with. Being third shift, it was interesting bunch of people. Management was good to people until it came to company policies and then they did not back workers when they should have. One policy that is not right is attendance within the first 90 days.

"Basic job, stressful at times, not enough recognition","Wal-Mart is what everyone expects it to be. Hours aren't great, takes several years to make a decent salary, and management isn't what you'd hope for, minus a select couple. Management doesn't have an understanding of how customer interaction effects your productivity, and expect you to do more than possible. Benefits aren't worth it as every year they charge more and offer less. One week I work 30 hours, the next 19. One day I will close at 10 or 11, the next they expect me to be in between 5 or 7 a.m.",3,Current Employee,Produce Associate ,"Sterling, IL",10/20/12,2012,10,20

The worst place to work,The pay is not comparable to other companies. Walmart cares about lining their pockets and not about their employees. Walmart expects you to run not only your department but others as well. I ran frozen/dairy and the meat. I was never compensated for it and was making 10.15 an hour. They make it seem like the union is bad for everyone at walmart. They chased the union out of our store and told them that they were trespassing. The employees of walmart need a union to bargin for better pay and benefits.

Other than that, not bad.Management is quick on issues, they can't control how the computer sets things up for them, so once the issue about the amount of time to stock is dealt with it's not so bad.

this place really sucks,"If you're going to work for Wal-mart do it during the day because if you're an overnight worker you're screwed. Nevermind the $1 an hour more you get paid. If you work overnight all you do is clean up everything day turn screwed up. They give you ""tasks"" and compute how long stocking freight and picks should take you and god help you on the nights where the computer says you have 10+ hours of freight because management will never send anyone to help you and if you work part time, management will expect you to work over until your work is done and rip you apart if anything isn't perfect. I'm trying my hardest to find a job to replace this place and I'm even considering taking a job that pays half of what I make now because this place is so god awful.

My co-workers are fun to work with, its never a dull moment.I would say the hardest part of the job, is being pulled off one project to do another before you can finish, or just having people telling you one thing an have another person tell you something else, when it comes to management.

The hardest part of this job is being able to encourage and develop associates even when I am not in agreeance with company directive.There are both strong and weak managers in my store; all of whom teach me how to be the best leader I can be through their own actions.

Great pay for a young person.,Walmart was when I was younger. It was great because I didn't have any children or major responsibilities. They gave me a lot of hours and the pay was bearable. The managers weren't always so great though. They felt they could talk to you any way they wanted and when I felt I was being discriminate against they didn't do much about it. I had a supervisor who was really cruel and even threatened me and I was the one in trouble.

It use to be where you could go in as a new associate and have everyone and their brother be available to help and train you the ""Walmart"" way.As Management Changed, which it changed ALOT 5 different store managers, and i hear there is a 6th one here now. I was Self Taught, I took pride when i got into management knowing that there was not too much they actually taught me, i just observed other peoples mistakes and seen alot of people come and go, and that just told me discapline wise, that's NOT what to do.However i have worked at a few other walmart's during setup when they would remodel and when they was setting up new stores, and it was a fun, and great time. everyone was there to work and you had current employees from other stores, teaching you what they know... You could talk too them about what its like to work in their Walmarts.

Very hard work not enough perks or thanks handed out.,I enjoyed working at Wal-mart for about the first year and a half. The policies and the way work ethics were handled began to change. You were expected to get more done than was possible. I work very hard and give 200 %. Wal-mart is short staffed 99% of the time. the home office is only concerned about the money they can make. The balance for work to family was not good. Wal-mart has been the hardest job I have ever had. I grew up on a farm and I know what hard work is.

Sam Walton was a good man and if he were alive today Wal Mart would be a better place, Wal Mart acts as if they are not out to close down the little bussiness but I know first hand that is a lie, Direction from above is simpley not right and some one needs to open their eyes, they work their people for next to nothing and there words are ""IF THEY DONT LIKE IT QUIT"" that is so sad. They have cut labor back so bad that the management team is having to work extra just to try and put product on the shelves, yet store managers and higher up are yelling to get the job done but you dont see any of them rolling up their sleves to help....Wal-Mart has outside job fairs for management yet there is plenty of GOOD management that should be promoted but if you dont play their game you can forget it,I realize that new talent is needed but look benith your nose and figure out another way dont make the people that have been dedicated for years suffer.. so much for promoting on talent..

Once freight was done then we moved on to projects like moving clothing and shoes around or stocking shelves with freight, or doing signing. At some point I was to cover breaks in Jewelry and answer the phones in the fitting room.

I didn't like the fact of how they paid you for being a cashier but wanted you to do things you were not qualified for. I would run the register, as well as, stock the shelves and assist customers on the floor with their shopping needs.

Helped people choose glasses and lenses to suit them.,"Work consisted of taking a customers prescription and figuring out what type of frame they would need to fit the lenses that they would need. It was my job to make sure they could see perfectly through the glasses when they picked them up, which usually took about a week. I also wanted to make sure they liked the way they looked in them, and that part of it was very fun because each person was unique, so it never really became mundane.

Hated working for walmart.,Didn't enjoy working for this company because they never cared for the employees. They cared about making a profit and making our job harder. They cut our people down to where we were so thin that it made it impossible to be successful at my job. I was passed over for a promotion that i deserved and worked hard for. They gave it to an individual who didn't deserve the job. He couldn't do the job and quit 2 months later.

Not always believable,10 to 12 hours per day especially in smaller stores. Learned an incredible inventory system and sales displays. Management is detrimental when 1 is on duty from 5pm to 11pm. Never get out of store within the first hour after closing. It's hard when co-workers don't share the workload. Hardest part was managers didn't document disciplinary actions. The most enjoyable part was seeing individuals recognized for their accomplishments.,3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Oxford, NC",10/7/12,2012,10,7
Wal-Mart,My job was as a wireless sales associate. The people I worked with and for we're awesome and are still my friends today. I learned that team work is a vital skill as is competent caring leadership. Walmart was a great place to work for when I started in 2005 but it has sadly degraded all aspects of its culture from employee/customer relations to manager/employee relations. The benefits have been scaled back and there are strong implications that one may be terminated if you try to join or start a union movement. The best part of the job was getting to help people learn technology they thought they'd never master. The least enjoyable part was watching the company degrade its standards and high principles in exchange for higher profits and lower wages.,4,Former Employee,Wireless Sales Associate ,"Daytona Beach, FL",10/7/12,2012,10,7
An enjoyable place to work and some times cookouts,"A typical day at walmart was counting my fegister before I get started,assistaing customers.I learned how to handle extremly rude customers..Management was available to assist in area he was needed.The hardest part of the job was trying to please all my customers and the enjoyable part was satisfied customers.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Greenville, MS",10/7/12,2012,10,7

"Productive place to work,excllent benifits and great people to work with.","My typical day started at 5:30am. I was a hauler. I was lucky I had one of the easier jobs in the wharehouse. I got on my piece of equipment and with my scan gun. Had to scan every item that I took from the recieving dock and when I got to correct location it was scanned off. It went like this all day long. Hardest part of my job was when it was cold out. Having 12 dock doors opened for trucks which sometimes had snow in them made it a cold shift. and I hate the cold. Had to dress warm. The other hard part of my job was had makeing production each and every week. If not then I would get a coaching. Thank goodness it was a rolling production because you do have bad days. Management was great I liked all my mangers and supervisors. I loved my co-workers we depended on each other to get the job done so we could go home on time. I learned alot about time management and how a wharehouse works and alot about Walmart.

Productive and fun work place,"At the beginning of every shift, managers and associates attend a 10 to 15 minute-meeting in which they decide how the work is going to be organized for the night (Basically, who is going to do what?).Involved in performing several tasks from running point of sale terminals to organizing merchandise on the shelves, I learn the importance of time managing in the workplace. I mostly learn how a good time managing can increase the overall output of the company and also how an ineffective time managing can harm the company.The management is divided into three categories, store manager shift manager, assistant manager. Each of them contributes to the success of the company by implementing the right strategy to ensure that the company meets its daily goal in terms of sales. The strategy is executed by associates who as a team help each other to overcome the challenges that they face.Regarding the work environment, the hardest part comes into place when we, associates or managers, do not ""get the job done."" Typically, when there is freight left to be stocked or when customers are unsatisfied by their experience in the store. However, when to goals are met, every employees can get a bonus at the end of the quarter if they meet certain criteria or they can even have a recognition such as ""Associate of the Month"", "" Rising Star"".",3,Current Employee,Cashier and New Employee Trainer ,"Frederick, MD",10/6/12,2012,10,6

The co-workers for the most part were very nice, friendly and respectful people. That was the main thing that kept me working there. The other factor was this present tough economy.

Walmart Review,"I enjoy my career at Walmart, however it is hard to advance from the position I currently hold unless you are willing to move at least half way across the country, so limited more local advancement in Asset Protection. Typically I monitor internal and external theft and case build through evidence and then prosecute whenever possible, I also have ties to all Local, State, and Federal Regulatory Agencies to insure compliance. ATF, Food Safety, OSHA just two name three. I enforce and teach, train, and develop associates and Management about all company policies and procedures and conduct a coaching process or terminate if needed. I am directly involved in accident prevention and accident investigation processes. Co Workers seem to not want to follow company policy. I am HIPPA trained and certified, however I have noticed and reported to Walmart Ethics violations regarding HIPPA violations as my position requires. There is a lack of confidentiality among some associates and management.",4,Current Employee,Asset Protection Manager ,"Waynesboro, VA",10/4/12,2012,10,4

It was a good experience I learned a lot.,"An average day at Walmart would be us clocking in at 4 p.m. then heading straight to the docks to unload the merchandise truck. That would usually take about 3 hours with a 15 minute break 2 hours in. After we finished unloading all the items off the merchandise truck, we were then split up into groups and are either sent to unload the grocery truck, separate the miscellaneous items from boxes, push carts, hang up clothing or stock on the floor until lunch break. After lunch break we then brought out all the organized items from the trucks out onto the floor on pallets and/or carts. When we finished bringing all the pallets and carts to the floor we did picks, meaning we used a tool called a Telxion to check inventory and refill/replace bins of items in the backroom. At the end of the day we cleaned the backroom area until it was time to clock out.I learned so much working for Walmart, I learned how to work in a fast paced, physical work environment, how to work as a team. I also gained a ton of experience working with equipment such Telxions and power like the electric power jack and scissor lift.Management was questionable though, a lot of associates hours including mine were erased from computers and never accounted for. Some supervisors and assistant managers were rumored to be fired for ""being too nice"" which in turn caused the other supervisors and assistant manager to become harsher on us.The co-workers were great!

It was good place to start off learning how things worked.,"It was a good place to start off learning things worked, meaning if certain managers liked you; you the sky was the limit. But I'm not about to go down that road. The employees that I was fortunate to work with were awesome. The only time it would get difficult, is on Black Friday. Chaos and disorder would breakout. Even when a new gaming system would be released. Fun. Overall not to bad. The worst thing that happened to me while I was there; my father had passed away, my wife had called for me.

At night when its almost time to clock out zoning happens again and locking up of the keys for the department. The most important thing i learned while working at Wal-Mart is that it is not always about being in a manager position to make your job work. What I mean by that is you don't have to have the power to be happy and from what I have seen is that being in power can be really stressful for some people. The management team there was really nice and respectful and even like to have fun every now and then. The best part was working with my co-workers they were a lot of fun and we had some good times. The hardest part of the job would be the holidays, this would bring in a rush of people and it would stay busy all day.

I would scan the conditions of the lot as well as see if the lot is properly staffed. Once I am on the clock I would immediately check the staffing for the day, checking for call outs, no shows or not enough staff. Then we would get togeher with the mgnt team to dicuss the days tour notes and and any issues we may see for the day. At that point I would get with my dept mgrs to share the notes and assign each accordingly as well as discuss any issues they may have or any needs they may have. That was one of my most enjoyable part of the day was to have this te to talk with them and help resolve any issues they may have. The hardest part of the day was ot feeling like there was enough time in the day to get what you want and need to get done and to make sure you have done everything possible to make your associates day go by without a hitch aswell as the vast aount of customer service that needed to be done. All in all it taught me how to work with a wide variety of different personalities and cultures.

At the same time this was the hardest part of my job, as I had became promoted to this supervisor position. Previous co-workers may have been jealous with my rapid career growth. Although this was hard, over some time it became very easy.The most enjoyable part, would be my career growth within Wal-Mart. I was requested for business trips in and out of the state.

The ins and outs of WalMart.,"Working for the largest retail in America has taught me many things. First and foremost, the excellent customer service is the key to success. After all, without customers, you have no business! Secondly, working for WalMart taught me that having respect for the individual (yourself!) can lead to multiple advances in your career life. My typical day usually consists of the following: clock in, do an EPC (electronic product code) scan, work freight, price changes, counts, ordering merchandise we're out of, set modulars, finalizing counts, and assisting customers throughout the day. As with any job, there are difficult tasks that you face daily. Whether it be a disgruntled customer, or management/ICS continually asking why your counts haven't been finalized.

Good job to gain retail experience,"In the 12 1/2 years at this company I gained a great deal of experience. There was good training and the envirinment of the store was good. Have the SWAS program, which was Store Within a Store, you had the opprotunity to treat your department as your own store. I liked this model because it made more personala and more challenging. On a typical day, running your business there were tasks that had to be done as well as ones that were at your descretion. Schedules had to be made, inventory checked in as well as one on one customer service. Some days you would be in a different department. The people that I worked with at the time were family oriented and were willing to work. I made some lifelong friends. The hardest part was inventory because we had to count and then an outside company came in to count. Some years they did not do such a good job. The most enjoyable part for me was interacting with customers, forming relationships and have become repeat customers. I see some of these same people today and they say ""you worked at walmart"".",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Hampton, VA",9/30/12,2012,9,30

"Decent workplace with expected workload, but terrible management team.","Walmart is a very somber company to work for in my personal opinion. Day-to-day tasks and responsibilities were at par and to be expected in retail, and the general feel of the facility is pretty enjoyable on most days. However, the lack of communication between members of the management team along with said individuals personal egos makes the job overly stressful on the crew. Managerial conflicts as to what an associate should do or not do often puts associates in tight spots. This often has certain associates on the hot seat with certain managers. Half of said managers having little interest to what an associate might have to say about the situation.",3,Former Employee,ICS Associate ,"Cleveland, OH",9/28/12,2012,9,28
Too Few or Too Many Hours = No Money or No Life,"While the work is not particularly difficult, dealing with a nearly constant flow of customers (of all shapes and personalities) can become quite taxing. My biggest qualm with the place, however, is not the workers or even the customers, but the fact that I am scheduled either too few hours or too many hours, which means too little money or absolutely no social life. As a recent college graduate and an individual who places great value on ties with family and friends, I find that it is impossible to make enough money to pay bills on a low-hour income, but when scheduled more hours, I have no time for family or friends. This I would not mind as much, however, after being told to request off at least three weeks in advance if there is an event happening in the future, my requests are consistently rejected (though there are more than enough associates to cover few hour time-span). So, either I call in, or I am forced to miss a family event or obligation that I have been planning in advance for several months. All for just above minimum wage. Perhaps I am asking too much, but I certainly do not wish to be a slave to a corporation making some semblance of money when I would rather live my life in the company of family and friends.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,Missouri,9/27/12,2012,9,27

Excellent company to work for.,"First, I want to say that there is never a day that is close to the same. There are different challenges, different interactions, and different things that need to be done each day. I can give you a basic overview of some of the things that are pretty regular throughout the day, but again, some might happen, and some might not.Arrive at time I am scheduled. Look around to see who I am working with that day. Look for any carts that need to be worked, find out what basic housekeeping needs to be done. Help customers throughout the day as needed. Help customers with phone activations. Maintain the computer ink. Help customers with layaway. Run a front-end register if there are long lines. Help clean and work freight in Toy Department. Maintain movies and video games. Change on-hand-counts on items as needed. Ensure items that need to be in security boxes are in them.Working in retail, I have to say that I have learned so much, I barely know where to begin. I have learned how to interact with any type of person. I have learned how to manage my time and stay organized and focused on a task. Working for Wal-Mart is my first real job, so I have learned how to interact with management at any level. I have learned how to keep calm and focus in a stressful situation.

"Large amount of work, little compensation.",This company has drastically changed over the past ten years. It used to be a company that cared and was involved in the associates lives. It worked with them to provide a suitable schedule and work enviroment. It is no longer this way and quite honestly it saddens me. The values that once made this company strong have all but disappered. It is now very micro managed and all about making money. It is still enjoyable to work there for the most part and becomes some what addicting. I started there thinking it was something temparary and ended up working there for almost twelve years. The biggest issue with this company is that almost everyone (including the management) is there just to collect a paycheck and do not put their heart into the job.,3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Overland Park, KS",9/25/12,2012,9,25

A day in the life of Wal-Mart DC 6048,"My daily duties consist producing large volumes of freight in a timely manner while adhering to strict quality requirements. My department is loosely managed because due to its large size; I work with 50-60 people daily. Strict management is not required because every individual has specific assignments which require little or no assistance from the management team. Many of my co-workers have been working alongside me for many years and have truly become my work family. After working ten hour shifts, four days a week for many years, family is the only term that seems appropriate. The most difficult part of my job would have to be the work conditions. The facility in which I work has no air conditioning system or heating system. Therefore, extreme heat and cold makes the work place difficult and uncomfortable at times. In addition to poor working conditions, the opportunity for growth and advancement does not exist. Despite, my knowledge and experience I feel like I have flat lined. I am seeking a career not just another 9 to 5. I want to make a difference in the lives of others. The most important and most enjoyable of my job is customer service, making sure customers always have access to good quality products.",3,Current Employee,Distribution and Receiving ,Opelousas.

Walmart Stocker,Basically late night stocking making sure the shelf's are full. Sometimes running the register as well and helping cashiers. The job was a third shift job I really did not enjoy because of the hours and the schedule at the time.

Recommending and selling gardening supplies,"Wal-Mart can be a friendly environment with its cultural diversities in staff as well as clientele; work with each customer who needs assistance by recommending the BEST product(s) for his/her needs and also provide fast and friendly checkout at the registers; learned much more by working with plants, trees, insecticides, and the lawn in general and especially about gardening; management can be a bit demanding at times but for the most part friendly rapport has been developed between me and the managers for a solid foundation in our friendship and communication; co-workers are fun to work with and we work together as a team which makes the job fun and easy; Wal-Mart's scheduling is tough at times, some shifts being early while others being later in the day sometimes makes for unpredictable planning at home when, of course, at times other things need to be done; being able to work with my fellow employees is a great delight as I have learned a lot from them and taught a lot, always a pleasure",3,Current Employee,"Garden Associate, Cashier ","McKinney, TX",9/23/12,2012,9,23

Productive but poor work environment & management,"A typical day at work consisted of many different things. I was constantly busy, which is always a plus. I learned how to follow structured, task-based assignments on time and how to work for a big corporation. I learned how to multi-task even more, along with all the basic work that goes along with being a sales associate/customer service. The hand-held computer had many options to learn and I was always learning when it came to that aspect of the job. Management was not the best because all the associates had different managers, who all worked in different ways. They would rotate. In the two years I was there, I had four assistant managers/supervisors for the apparel department. Then of course the store manager. Sometimes it could get confusing due to the constant changes and work ethic. For the most part I got along with all of my co-workers, but in all reality you will never get along with or be ""friends"" with who you work with. You need to know where to draw the line. If any of my co-workers ever needed help, I was there. We were supposed to be a team, but towards the end, it seemed like people started to care less and less about working together and appeared to care less about the job in general. The negativity and constant complaining was one of the hardest part of the job. Also the fact that Walmart was extremely strict could be both hard, but at times enjoyable. It was enjoyable to know I had consistent hours, legitimate breaks, including dinner, time and a half on Sundays, holiday pay, personal hours & vacation hours. That was the most enjoyable and professional aspect - more...",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Wareham, MA",9/23/12,2012,9,23

Hope that something better comes along,"I really can't recommend anyone work for Walmart unless you have no alternatives. Even then, try to make your time with them as short as possible.When I was with the company, I worked overnights as a stocker. Not a bad job and I worked with some good people.However...Drama was very prominent in the workplace. Managers were biased towards certain people, specifically those that didn't put any real effort into their work, while those that did often got the short end of the stick.The plus side to working for Walmart is having the ability to plan around your schedule. When you went in for your shift, your hours were set--if you were scheduled for an eight hour day, you worked your eight hours and left.The downside is you better hope you have a supplemental income or another job with real benefits, because what Walmart offers is pathetic. They've made it a point to reduce their full-time workforce as much as possible and fill in with part-timers that don't get any sort of benefits, all in an effort to maximize profits while cutting costs.My review may seem slanted in one direction, but believe me when I say, if you've heard a horror story from a former employee, odds are it was true.",1,Former Employee,Receiving Associate/Overnight Stocker ,"Winchester, Virginia",9/22/12,2012,9,22

Inventory associate.,I would not recommend working for walmart. The pay is average raises are yearly but minimal. Management for the most part is pretty terrible. I have brought many problems to their attention both safety issues and inventory issues. They either fail to correct issues in a timely manner or just completely ignore the issues all together. It took them 6 -8 months to fix a very serious safety issue a couple of my co workers and I had brought to their attention many times. Inventory issues which cause a cascade effect if not managed will cause either a shortage of inventory or an over abundance of inventory that ends up clogging the back room making it very difficult to get my daily tasks done especially around the holiday season. If you hear some one complain that Walmart is constantly out of stock of products...that's why. The A/M's do not listen to you and are terrible at scheduling. If you want to work at Walmart and hope to get days off when needed forget it. They do not look at your time off requests unless you bug them constantly about it. Same goes for growth in the company. If you want to change positions you have to bug them almost weekly until they give in. If you want to move up in the company you better pray you are one of the favorites. If you work in a position that takes a lot of training and you want to move to another position you better have a really good reason for moving because they will find a way to coach you to prevent you from moving. If you get coached you can't move any where or transfer for 6 months until that coaching falls off you record.

Great for a 16 Year Old but Not for a Family,"This job of employment was perfect for when I was in High School and college, but when I began to create my own little family Wal-Mart failed to give any work/life balance. Every holiday was suppose to be alternated one on, one off. This always failed because the turnover rate was near 40% because as an established tradition at Wal-Mart is the hire and fire technique that produces everyday low prices for the general public. Management made unsensable decisions when it came to continuing employment.

The Companys management is good to work with when they are delegating to their department managers,support manages and sales floor assoicates.

"If you are lazy or stubborn, this is not the place for you.","A typical day at work requires patience and prioritizing. Never having worked retail before, it was an eye opener. There are times when day to day responsibilites are the same, then at times it is very demanding and fast paced. You need good communication skills between management, associates, and customers. There's always learning opportunities. I've learned a lot of patience with this position. You have to be willing to adapt. Changes are common and if you do not like change, good luck, Unfortunately, poor attitudes are also common with this job and I think that is the hardest part of the job. You see it in customers, co-workers, management, You have to maintain your composure. What I do love about my job is the friendly customers and how they can bring me back to reality. Good conversation while helping a customer makes my job so much easier. Although being on my feet all day can be a pain, everyday is something different and that makes it bearable. I enjoy being with co-workers and teamwork. My employer has a reputation for not appreciating its employees at the corporate level but I feel with the responsibility I am personally given from my department manager, the respect from my supervisor and open communication with store management I am valued. Honestly employees are stretched a liitle too thin here but if you make the most of it it says something of your work ethic and sooner of later advancement is bound to happen for you.

I would still be at WalMart if it was ""WalMart"". The company itself is just not a very family friendly company.

Great work place for people that are retired or have disabilities.,"In my time working there, I have noticed that they really seem to work with people there with disabilities, I mean major disabilities. People that are(and not talking bad, just that's the way it is) mentally unstable, very slow, and have major life functionalities. SO, in that said, Walmart is perfect for those people. I noticed a lot of retired folks work there, and a lot of HS students.Pay isn't the greatest, expect only minimum wage. Benefits? I guess if you're management, but that didn't matter to me. It seemed like people that were there for more than 10 years liked it. There are a few people working there that had 10 and 30 years, which is good for job stability.I think on the most part, not being ""micro-managed"" was a super plus. You do your job, and if need be correction, they let you know. They were very flexible with your schedule, so I think it's a good job for people that don't mind being paid $8/hr for a long time.I find it very hard for people to be fired from there, but I supposed it has happened, I think you have to try very hard for that to happen. Although, someone told me they were fired from there, for something he thought was stupid. What can I say? It's a mediocre job with mediocre pay, and not much advancement.

productive but stressful because of lack of communication amongst management,unload 2 or 3 trucks by putttin merchandise on rollers to roll down to other members of team to sort and stack on pallets on most days that became a problem because we didn't have the space needed to do that sufficiently. management was not really too involved with the unloading process. we were in the back of the store and the part that we played hardly ever was seen by customers so they didn't really focus on our crew that much until we had a problem because of the lack of space. co-workers were fun to be around especially on our crew because we hung out with each other even during non-working times that made working together go smoothly like a team with good chemistry plays better than a bunch of all-stars that don't get along. hardest part of the job was that the crew was understaffed and management would sometimes allow some crew members to leave early no matter how much work was left. working with those guys was the most enjoyable part of the job,2,Former Employee,Unloader ,"McComb,MS",9/18/12,2012,9,18

Wal-Mart is a good company,A typical work day was 7 am to 4pm. This was a department manager shift Monday thru Friday. First thing in the morning we would come in and review the sales for the department from the previous day. With this information you would use it to see how or what you needed to do to gain as much sales as possible. By this I mean like checking features and endcaps to help produce sales. If the department had price changes to be done you would perform these via a Telxon throughout the department. Being a department manager you were also responsible for the in-stock of the department. So if you had an item that was out you were responsible for finding it in the stock room if there was inventory on hand or ordering it if the department was completely out. I was also responsible for any stock left over from the overnight shift. At times when the store got busy I would also go up to the front end and help ring up the customers.,5,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Roseville, MI",9/18/12,2012,9,18

Unbalanced and unorganized work system. No positive contact between management and employees.,My typical day at work consists of me unloading Freezer/diary loads from delieverd trailers. After load is complete i down size pallets of frozen product to be stocked on the floor. Once frieght is done i am responsible for managing over stock in inventory. I label box's then put them in organized form in bins then enter upc's in inventory systems. Management Doesnt take initiative to personaly know or care for there employees.

CoWorkers are like family, when one is in crisis, they all pull together to help support each other emotionally or physically, whatever is needed. What I do not like is that it is hard to advance in this store, though they encourage you to try. I do not like to feel like I am in a rut not progressing toward any kind of a goal, and that is how I feel at this point.

Good place to work.,"Walmart is a great place to work if you have no family. They do give the schedule 3 weeks in advance, but the hours you seem to get make it impossible to spend time with your family. The hours are never the same.

Overworked,I work at the worst store in the region. The upper management treats us like dogs and works us to the bone. The expectations are astronomical. I've been in retail management for 5 years now and I've never been this overworked in my entire life. I'm expected at work at 7 am 5 to 6 days a week and don't leave sometimes until midnight. Store manager is a joke and should have been gone 20 years ago due to his moral values and corruption . Training for external employees is a joke. You get the Walmart culture or you get out. They hand you a walkie and some keys and send you to a training class that teaches you nothing about your job. they give you an army of tasks to get done with only a small amount of associates and expect it done before a meeting. The meetings are just ridicule sessions that could last 2 hours long. There is so much I could say but I don't have the time. Walmart lost its values with Sam Walton passing away.,1,Current Employee,Assistant manager ,Ok,9/16/12,2012,9,16

From Friendly to Hostile,"When I began to work for Walmart, they were very friendly. They didn't just work with my school schedule, they wanted to work with it so I could do my job to the fullest. As the years dragged on, they changed their philosophy. The friendly managers that I loved were replaced by hostile business men and women who snubbed off the associates. They only talked to the associates when they had something to complain about (or someone to fire).

There is so much to do, you must hustle. There is no overtime, almost everyone there were labeled as temporary meaning no benefits yet, managers were full time with full benefits.

Walmart works hard to ensure labor laws are followed; more stable work schedule in pharmacy for hourly associates,"Working at Wal-Mart was a great experience. Their store intranet ""The Wire"" was a great tool for learning company goals and policies as well as state and federal regulations for all departments. With the Wire being updated frequently through-out the day, I was never behind on initiatives or uninformed about goals. Moreover, the global computer based learning enabled me to enhance my knowledge about my position as well as learn the fundamentals of other positions I was interested in pursuing. I learned a great deal about logistics and human resources, project management, store level and district metrics, and managing a team. In pharmacy, my salary was 35% above average and I hired technicians at 14-17$/hour due to local economics. However, the location wasn't to my liking. Also, pharmacy was able to provide hourly employees with more consistent schedules compared to division 1.Although Wal-Mart's culture and values are eloquently stated upon hire and on ""The Wire"", I've found that many departments do not live up to the standards and expectations of the company as a whole.Albeit difficult to understand the matrix structure of many large corporations, I think that Wal-Mart would be better able to cut operating costs and manage as a whole by training employees to better utilize the system they have available to them (the Wire) rather than spend excessive money hiring mid-level managers to disseminate information already available via the Wire.
