Very productive.,"Always some type of work to do to keep you busy, great and understandable managers. Very considerate shifts, you will get the hours that you prefer. I love the environment and the staff. Hardest part of job was standing on feet 9 plus hours.",5,Former Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ,"Pearl, MS",8/14/17,2017,8,14
Its good but not great,My work experience here has and is still not what I had imagined. I have witnessed people being physically abused and I am myself as well abused. It is a great place to start for your first time but not as a long term job.,3,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Oklahoma City, OK",8/14/17,2017,8,14
What it's like.,"Walmart has great benefits, that's why I'm still there. Management does little to help or provide help. They often expect you to do more than one person can do. The upper management lies and throws lower management under the bus. It's a job though I'm glad I have one.",3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Amarillo, TX",8/14/17,2017,8,14
Love the company!,"I actually love working at Wal-Mart, love my co-workers, love my customers (most of them anyway). Despite the rumors you hear about Wal-Mart, my experience has been mostly very positive. The management is very supportive, the opportunities for advancement are there if you want to go that route..you just have to be willing to work for it! My day is pretty typical. I do a lot of stocking, a lot of what we call 'zoning', which is just straightening things up.  We are there for the customers, and most of the customers are awesome and so fun to talk to while you're ringing up their merchandise. What I really don't like is what I will call 'upselling'...push the product service plans, push the credit cards. The hardest part is really just being on my feet all day, but I've done that forever and I've learned to just handle it. What I probably enjoy the most is the people I work with, and that is what I will miss when I leave Wal-Mart. People are happy to see me come to work, and that feels really good.",5,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Tigard, OR",8/14/17,2017,8,14
Not a fun place to work,Lack of management skills. Do not care about employees. Not enjoyable. They ask you to work overtime then get angry that you have over time. Do not work here,1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Warrenton, VA",8/14/17,2017,8,14
"Good paying job however, doesn't pay off","For anyone starting off in the workforce, this is a great job. However, I wouldn't recommend it for people in the long-term. I will say that Wal-Mart definitely rekindled the flame of my ambition to do greater things such as finish my bachelor's degree and find another job that pays well and gives proper breaks. The work isn't hard however, the management makes it difficult with the constant changes of rules and regulations which makes it harder for us as employers. Management seems to only care about the numbers rather than its' employers.",3,Current Employee,Distribution Center Warehouse Associate ,"Atlanta, GA",8/14/17,2017,8,14
It's ok,No staffing. If your sick you can not be excused even if u have a doctors note. Training is poor. Management does not listen to there associates. I like the costumer service working with my co workers.,2,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Photo technician ,"Hermantown, MN",8/14/17,2017,8,14
Worse job ever,"Management is every where, lack of leadership and lack of communication. They over work yet underpay everyone and treat employees like they are nothing",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Richmond, TX",8/14/17,2017,8,14
"Horrible management,","Managers were very rude. Even when you gave them your schedule they would schedule you outside that schedule as they saw fit especially around holidays. The pay was horrible. They advertise that they raised wages but only after requiring people to work certain hours, reducing benefits, reducing overnight differential, and cutting other corners that affect the lower staff.",1,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Monroe, NY",8/14/17,2017,8,14
hard with advancement opportunities,not a bad place to work however the hours and workload and increase at any giving time. there is not enough work and home balance especially when you are in management,3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Rome, GA",8/14/17,2017,8,14

bill of goods,"what you are told in orientation is stretching the truth as far as working with YOUR schedule. If you are available 24/7 all is good, but if you need specific times you are told you may only get 8-10 hrs a week.

Working At Walmart,"I didn't work at Walmart long, but it was the worst job experience I've ever had. I have health issues that make it hard to stand for a full shift.

I learned you have to be professional at all times and be productive too. Management was very good and top notch they were very patient with me. The hardest part of the job for me was not being able to reach my goal at that time. The workplace culture was very new to me I was still very young and didn't have enough experience under my belt. hardest part of the job was maintaining my area. The most enjoyable experience of the job was meeting new people and earning my money on my own.",4,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"San Diego, CA",8/14/17,2017,8,14

"Although I loved working for Walmart, the pay and management was not what I was expecting.","In the first 4 months of me working for Walmart, the pay and management were wonderful they worked with me on my hours, and I had a guaranteed 40hrs each week.

Management was considered a father figure of the 'family'.",3,Former Employee,Inventory Control Specialist ,"Mobile, AL",8/14/17,2017,8,14
Good place to work for a short term,Overall a good place to work if you really need a job. The pay was pretty good  and you usually get enough hours. The management is professional but maybe too much at times. At times they can be all in your business and watching you every minute to make sure you take short breaks. Most of the people that you work with have been there 5-10 years and hate their job. I don't recommend this place as a long term job.,2,Current Employee,Stock Associate ,"Stephenville, TX",8/14/17,2017,8,14

That's an okay place to work,My opinion is a big pens on what Walmart store you work at to what kind of treatment you get each one is so different in management.

Mixed feelings.,"It was fast paced, I used to go in there and the day would just go by. As an online grocery pickup everything had deadlines. As a cashier time went slow. We had to make sure the customers were moving because we did not want big lines. When there were not a lot of people in the store we had to make sure our space was clean and the aisle was neat. The managers would tell us when to go to break and monitor how long we took. We had hour long lunches but worked for eight hours. The worst part of the day would have to be mean and rude customers. I tried my best to stay positive.

Not an environment i recommend to friends,"I think the environment is what one would expect from an organization so large, but founded with the mentality of your local grocer.  There is only one-way communication is executed - downward.  The company culture does not recognize nor foster any sense of ownership or personal accountability.  Turnover is atrocious.  Senior management cares little for the well-being of its employees.  However, the average worker is great.  Their dedication toward an organization that cares little for them is amazing.",1,Former Employee,Facility Manager ,Texas,8/14/17,2017,8,14
Management too strict,"Working at walmart was like a reality TV show, the camera was always rolling on you and there was a boss on the other end of the camera praying that you would take more than 30 seconds to get from the register to the time clock so he could come out and yell at you.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Athens, OH",8/14/17,2017,8,14

fast paced,Work there is ongoing it never seem to stop the busyness of the job helped the hours go go by quickly. Most of the people are easy to work with. yet as in any work place you will find some folks that are more of a challenge to work with Management is not always on the same page with what is going on and sometimes they make unrealistic demands for time allowed to get things accomplished and then wonder why it was not finished on their time table ... it is like the have forgotten that it takes time to do what is required and then all the extras they add on  leaves you with no time to get the required duties done and get the extras taken care of at the same time question is what do you leave undone to take care of their extra requests???? Then they wonder why this  or that was not done when it is physically impossible to accomplish..The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with fellow associates and interacting with the customers that came in throughout the shift.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Cashier/Stocker ,"North Little Rock, AR",8/14/17,2017,8,14
Long routine hours may require adjustment ...,"A typical day at Walmart is long with much standing on your feet. With time standing becomes easier, and the day seems less difficult to get through. There's little to worry about and days become routine.The most difficult thing about the job is the schedule. Adjusting to working nights and getting rest during the day doesn't always work out. There are times when there's the need to fight falling to sleep. Walmart is well staffed there are many people to help keep things going.",3,Former Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Cypress, TX",8/14/17,2017,8,14
Didn't like it.,"I hated working there. Employer only cares about themselves and saving money. They cut your hours for not reason.

Worst job experience I have ever had.,"The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was the customers and having the ability to help them. This is the only good thing I have to say about the company._x000D__x000D_The lack of training is horrible; the CBLs basically focused on the overview of the store and general procedures.

Exciting,There was really no typical dat at the work here because everyday you never know what management may have you doing depending on your job title.

There was lack of management,The only big concern I have is that the managers did not know how to manage.

Wal-Mart Life,"My experience with Wal-Mart have treated me wonderful. It becomes your second family. It has taught me how to handle difficult situations, interact with customers daily, learn each associates personalities and their strengths and opportunities.

good starter job,Walmart is an okay job for a highschool/college student. They are very flexible with scheduling and is pretty stress free. The biggest complaint I have is I end up running around half the store because of how understaffed we are on any one given day. Management doesnt seem to care and they are only trying to make themselves look good rather than others and the company as a hole. If you can manage to move up you can make a solid living. but most of the associates are very underpaid for the work they are expected to do,3,Current Employee,Sporting Goods Sales Associate ,"Grand Rapids, MI",8/13/17,2017,8,13

Avoid if possible,"If you NEED a job, short-term or temporary then go for it. But, you are very disposable to the company so don't buy into their talk about workplace culture. Their rules change and they have selective enforcement. They will work you to death if you let them, and if even you are a hard worker, while you may receive short-term praise, it won't last- the first time you slack or say no to something- they will be looking to replace you. Between the workplace drama among the associates and the impossible to meet expectations of management its not worth the toll to your physical health and sanity. If you have to work here, go to work, do your job, and leave! Don't make friends, don't gossip, don't chit-chat in the breakroom, and DON'T complain! do what you have to do to get your paycheck and leave!

If you don't mind standing for a while,"Being a cashier at Walmart wasn't the worst thing in the world. Having 10 hour shifts back to back or working 8 days in a row does get a little bit much, but they do give you a small discount on most things except food and clearance items, and we get paid 15 minute breaks. The problem is getting those breaks in a timely fashion so you're not standing for more than 3 hours at a time. Sometimes management drops the ball during the busy hours and cashiers get forgotten about or make customers wait for their assistance.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Grand Blanc, MI",8/13/17,2017,8,13
Good place to work at,My experience at Walmart was not that bad. I loved working there and my coworkers were really cool. I worked there while I was in college and never really had problems.

They make sure you are doing good and work side by side with you.the workplace culture is a very diverse culture, we all get along well with each other and we all make sure each other is not falling behind and keeping up with the pace. The hardest part of my job is making sure you keep the customer satisfied as you are completing your tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that you can help a customer with a question and knowing by the end you were the most helpful that they have ever encountered and is very thankful for assistance you have provided for them.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Keyser, WV",8/12/17,2017,8,12
"Low pay for what you did, benefits were good","I loved stocking shelves, it was a great weight loss program for me. Breaks were good.

I really hate to put this job down but..,I worked very hard for this company. I mean it was like a boot camp. We were not told how much work it really was. They basically hired any many young healthy people they could to re do their store. It was a huge job and they made you work very fast and very hard. They cut people constantly. You don't need an aerobics instructor with this job. I went home after my shift exhausted every time. Sometimes it was fun but not really. They didn't want you to talk and the work was heavy. I did make it through the re do and got hired as a night stocking person. It was just as much work. 5 people to do the stock for the whole grocery dept on most days. That's including freezers and dairy. Huge over stuffed pallets. I like the challenge of hard work so it was something I could do but it was pushing it.Christmas at Walmart is a huge deal and very taxing on the staff beyond the already taxed staff. Then they decided for whatever reason to get rid of us one by one after Christmas was over.  Even people I know who were good workers. And they weren't nice about it either. I saw several people get into words with the manger and some left crying. It was a very tense environment. I would recommend the Marines before Walmart.

The People are the Perks,"I loved working at Walmart despite the cliched cons. My teammates were engaged and interested in helping each other out, whether on the floor or between friends.

I was in an excellent store as well, and the customers were, by and large, pleasant.",3,Former Employee,Supervisor ,"Brighton, CO",8/12/17,2017,8,12

Great place to work,I enjoyed most of my time at Walmart. The CSMs were friendly and helpful. I did not like standing on my feet for long periods. Breaks and meal times did not always come when it was supposed to. I did not like my placement and talked to the assistant manager about it but nothing was done. I loved working with the ones I worked with and meeting new people. I also loved getting to know people. It was a fun atmosphere that made working fun. I believe the hardest part of the job aside from standing for long periods is dealing with the more complicated customers. It was a fun and enjoyable environment.,4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Benton, AR",8/12/17,2017,8,12

One thing about ASM position that is a downfall is that at any time they can send you to work third shift whether you want to or not.,3,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Belleville, MI",8/12/17,2017,8,12
Great staff but bad culture.,The culture is terrible. Managers are expected to work long hours and seldom get days off.  As long as you are willing to sacrifice your everything for Wal-mart  you can advance.,2,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Austin, TX",8/12/17,2017,8,12
"Good place to work, horrible management","I loved working here, I loved cake decorating, but the management was terrible. There was so much drama between employees that it made going to work awful. My Bakery manager was racist, unprofessional, and unfair. The manager above her, didn't care about her employees, didn't listen at all, spread gossip and rumors, and should never have been a manager. The compensation for a cake decorator is fantastic, especially if you have experience, but that's it. Anyone else is paid minimum wage. My hours for the first two weeks were 45/week and then were cut to 28 a week, and were declining each week because they had given out too much over time and had to make up for it. The drama was the worst part, and the managers made everything 10x worse and played employees against each other. Picture a gladiator arena, with managers in the stands, making employees try to kill each other. That's the work environment.",4,Former Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Ridgecrest, CA",8/12/17,2017,8,12

Walmart,management doesn't follow company policy and they play favorites. advancements is hard to get at Walmart. employees are great and you learn a lot about product and how to fix things. hardest part of working at Walmart is having to stay on management to fix things and how they look down on you. most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers and talking about products and servies with my fellow employees. over all Walmart pays ok and good people to work with but management sucks all around.,2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Evansville, IN",8/11/17,2017,8,11

The work itself is great.,On a typical day at work you would check over your Freight. Then you begin to go and put out the stock on the shows where it belongs. Fix any merchandise putting it back in its proper place if it's not in its proper place. I learned how to work quickly and safely. Also it's a great way to learn how to have great people skills. It teaches you how to have a great balance between work and your customers. Management is not always well-balanced nor did I find them easy to talk to all the time. But they weren't always hard to work with. Could use more synchronized communication. People from all over worked together and seem to get along very well. The hardest part of the job I would say for me would be the pace of the work because you had to get all your Freight up and then had to make sure that everything was zoned. Which means everything has to be pulled forward on the shelves and sometimes it's really hard to get everything done in multiple areas by yourself. The most enjoyable part about the job would probably be for me helping the customers and finding what they need no matter where it's at in the store.,3,Former Employee,Stocker/Cashier ,"Rowlett, TX",8/11/17,2017,8,11

Treat associates very bad.,They were always understaffed and expected three workers to do six people's worth of work without getting any overtime.

Sales associate at Walmart,Not much to say. Working at Walmart as a sales associate you're assigned to a department where if someone comes to you looking for an item you know where to point them towards but most of the time people will come asking you for something located to the other side of the store and when you need help finding the item it feels like you're the only associate in the whole store.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Muskegon, MI",8/11/17,2017,8,11

I believe the management could have been better, but overall I loved what I done there!",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Columbia, KY",8/8/17,2017,8,8
Stressful corporate job with low respect for policies.,"I would say that overall this company is a job that you take simply for pay. They pay decently compared to other similar jobs but they do not create a safe and tolerable environment. Management is the sole issue in the fact that every decision made is not interpreted or passed on effectively to the next person. Anytime there is a mistake by a member of management, the store gets hurt; while anytime an associate makes a mistake, that associate and other associates are the punished. This company has policies set up to diminish shrink and this store will not flourish as long as it contains a store manager who blatantly disregards them. Among the main issues lies lazy workers, lazy sub-management, workers with substance abuse problems, and an ""Us VS. Them"" mentality among ALL workers.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Tyler, TX",8/8/17,2017,8,8
Stressfull environment with terrible store management,Managers at Wal-Mart will be fighting against me 24/7. I work in the auto care center everything there is awesome the managers are good and I have nice co-workers. I get the worst customers who want to tell me off and start arguments and I just have to stay calm no matter what and sometimes let someone else handle a customer. The #1 problem is when it gets close to closing time I have to make a choice between writing vehicles up until close and let the techs get overtime and later get in trouble for having overtime or turn people away and get in trouble myself.,3,Current Employee,Automotive Salesfloor Associate ,"Lubbock, TX",8/8/17,2017,8,8

Good place to work with good benefits. It is tough to advance.,"The days are very consumed with taking care of customer needs as well as associate needs.I have learned much about the retail world.

The other problem is due to the lack of any consistant schedules. I love to work with people and resolve their issues.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,Fort Wayne,8/8/17,2017,8,8
"I wish they would get it together, and remember they were once someone not important.","walmart was a nice place to work for, and they could be again if they  were more intune to what they are doing to there good employees. They are making the work harder not smarter. For an example most of the time the managers aren't on the same page, they are unorganized when it comes to handling there assoicates; they give us something to do that they think is ready and waiting on us, but the fact is valueable time is wasted because nothing is as they thought it was. I am an old school person I want to earn my money by working not standing around and not have something to do for there is always something I can do, so instead of me standing around and doing nothing I make a suggestion about what and where I could be until they are ready for me to do the job they wanted me to do.

walmart review,Unsupportive managers and coworkers. No reasonable amount of sickdays.Customers are allowed to treat you horribly and you are unable to defend yourself.Even if the manager sees the customer using foul language at you and pushing you around they encourage the customer saying they are right and automatically assume it is the employees fault. Forced to work overtime even when it is your time to clock out.extremely disorganized schedule making and managers are very rude and biased.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Roswell, NM",8/7/17,2017,8,7

The people who work for walmart at my store were great,People there are great. They do however fire you after the holidays for any infraction because they over hire then they have to get rid of associates after their busy season which is what happened when my son worked for them.

A good place to work,"In my 5 years at Walmart I have taken every opportunity given to me to advance and moved up from a temporary  associate to a assistant manger. Walmart does not treat their mangers well. The training is poor there is no help long hours, days off are switched all the time hours change and the mangers above you go through the same thing it is a 24 hr job. Having a family and working at Walmart is a hard balance.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Manger ,"Tampa, FL",8/7/17,2017,8,7
Very aggressive people work here,"just 15 min. of overtime can lead to a write up. managers were constantly non-existent for questions or direction. This company holds a policy that states any employee can be promoted at any time regardless of tenure/experience which sounds great but I quickly found that this policy leads to the ""favorite"" employees being promoted while the less fortunate employees are never allowed to transfer or be promoted out of the original department they were hired for. E.G. my 2nd shift instock supervisor ""Bill"" spelled the word grocery wrong (grosery). One would think that alone would disqualify this individual from promotion pending further educational progression, however, he is now an assistant store manager at a walmart in the Denver metro market. We had 6 pallet jacks three of which were broken and two of the other three were malfunctioning. the store manager, once made aware of this fact, ordered replacements six months after he new about the equipment issues. to save money management also forced the 2nd shift instock crew to overwork ourselves by refusing to hire on more employees for the holiday season.",2,Former Employee,2nd shift instock team member ,"Lakewood, CO",8/7/17,2017,8,7

a daily basis,over worked under paid and not treated correctly at all. Wal mart stretches their employees thin. they expect a person to work over 5 to 15 individual departments a day while being asked to come cashier anytime called to do so. Their management does not care about their employees and does not take care of them. There is a lot of drama and problems between employees there and everyone is everyone else business . It is like working in a trashy high school again... this is not a recommended place at all .

I did what I could to keep our interactions to a minimum so that I could avoid a workplace dispute. But he had his plans and would seek out trouble with the other employees and make it difficult for them too. When we all reported it to our manager little action was taking besides a light reprimanding. When it came to Verbal abuse from the assistant manager I spoke with my manager about but still nothing.

"Terrible place to work, but if you need a job badly go for it.","The management is terrible. Supervisors try to take breaks before cashiers get theirs even though cashiers are suppose to get theirs first. You also have to wait for a supervisor to relieve from register or until another cashier replaces you, some times that will not be till 15 minutes after you should have clocked out. Only one cashier on third shift at a time, some times two or even none. Depending on what store you are working at, there tends to be a lot of customers at night during the first half of the month. Once my knee had swelled to the size of a soft ball and was in very excruciating pain. Tried to go home and they talked me into going to ER.

The Management is for the most part very understanding and willing to work with one’s situation, and is very approachable. The work Place Culture is Team Work, and Ethics.

Very Hard Work,"Working at Walmart is difficult and exhausting. You must work on your  feet your entire shift, and the work is manual and hard. Heavy lifting is expected of you.

I will then walk to my cosmetic station and start stocking the merchandise on to the shelves making sure everything is in its proper location, zoned and straight forward. Also helping customers check out and offering my advice and opinions with any questions or concerns they may have. I love working for Wal-Mart because they do provide great things for their customers as well as their associates, they provide a fast and friendly environment which I look for in an employer. Management is always on top of scheduling and making sure you have everything you need for your work day. I have learned to communicate and pay attention to details. I have learned how to multitask like a pro. By far has increased my customer skills. I got an award for 3 months in working this position.",4,Current Employee,Spiecality Cashier ,"Sacramento, CA",8/4/17,2017,8,4
A Typical Day at work,"A typical Day at work is what you make of it. At these few places I learned that no matter what any one says or does to always continue to stay positive. Management at these few places was pretty decent. The work place culture has always changed in the few places I have worked. There was no hard parts about Wal-Mart or McDonald's, But at Fed-Ex although the pay was good it required extreme lifting. I would say that would be the hardest part . The most enjoyable part of any job that I have is with my co-workers and my customers because talking & joking are both fun I enjoy to do so.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Dallas, TX",8/4/17,2017,8,4

Very stressful the average worker does not want to work! Cell phone!,I come in to work punch in maybe not sometimes theirs someone there to tell you when to clock in because Store Mgr. is cutting overtime. So when you get in the produce cooler its full all the way to the doors you can't even walk in! You have to pull pallets out just so you can see what you have otherwise this is in the morning shift! You have to breakdown the load 1st as you load carts for the sales floor almost no one has any training in produce just me and some people refuse to let you train them! Upper Management will not stand behind you when you go to coach associate therefore you are stuck with the problem and they still want to know why things are not getting done they fire the good hard workers and keep the ones who don't want to work go figure? People just show up to collect a check and want to talk on their cell phones or sometimes even tablets and upper Management  still wants to know why production numbers are not being met. When you go to coach them the store Mgr on your shift will not back you up so the problem never gets resolved it's like a catch 22 very stressful indeed!,3,Former Employee,Support Manager \ Merchandise Supervisor Produce ,"Phoenix, AZ",8/4/17,2017,8,4

Decent Work Experience,"I've gained so much confidence working here the past few years. As this was my first job, Walmart gave me the opportunity to work on my self-improvement, and I thank this job for helping me to overcome my fear of being in customer service. I got hired part time while still going to school and eventually they promoted me to full time. However, the longer I worked here, the more I began to see just how unfair and incompetent management really was. There were too many problems that they did not want to deal with, under-staffing issues being one of them. They pull associates from their departments to the registers, only to ask us later on why our department is a mess. Breaks were not given to us on time, and sales floor associates are overworked for minimum wage. Oftentimes I was pressured to give up my breaks just to get my work done so I wouldn't get coached by management. A few managers also showed a great deal of bias towards certain associates. Apart from all this, I do, however, enjoy the fact that my store had a very family-oriented environment and I've met a lot of great people working here.",3,Current Employee,Accounting Associate ,"San Jose, CA",8/3/17,2017,8,3

Okay job,"The company has gone downhill for several years. Management has gotten way worse in the past few years. Good pay for a little while, it took me almost 6 years to make over $10 an hour. New employees come in and make more than I do. They have the stupidest rules sometimes and getting anytime off is a joke, especially during the holiday season (October to January). Changing your availability is another joke; the punish you by ignoring your request or  schedule you a few hours. The only good side to this job right now is the benefits.

I usually am only over at the jewelry counter when a customer needs assistance there, such as for getting a case open so they can look at the jewelry or try it on before deciding to buy it/changing out watch batteries and watch bands for customers, or when I am scanning in jewelry freight, which I then put away, and place any overstock in our locked cases. Normally, we are short staffed, so I have to cover all breaks and lunches at the fitting room area where all incoming calls are received, while also going back and forth from the fitting room to the jewelry counter to help any customers that may come during that time. I also have to help the customers on the phones when after getting transferred that department doesn't pick up their phone call because they have either already left for the day, or they don't have any coverage in that area while they are on breaks.

Management steals from the store and from the workers.,"The management team at the Walmart I worked at stole a lot of goods from the store including T.V.'s and game systems, among other expensive items. They also tried to say on more then one account that they had lost my check and that it would take WEEKS for them to do anything about it. and when I tried to confront the management team they would elude me and come up with lies and excuses for why they couldn't help. However, there are a few members of management that are good, but they are outnumbered. Im very disappointed in the way the store was run.

Busy work environment but plenty of csm's to help cashiers with any trouble.,Usually mid week early mornings were slow and laid back. Breaks were usually on time as well as lunch. But weekends were so busy you might miss a lunch or break every now and then. But once I got used to the routine it wasn't so hard to handle. I learned alot about walmart policies that most people have no clue about. I learned that the csm's and cashiers stood together as a team and that most of the people i worked with would've gone above and beyond to help if they could. My favorite part about working there was when it was slow and I would zone my isle I got to people watch. Which was probably the highlight of my day. The culture was like family. But the hardest part was having to bit my tongue when a customer would give me attitude for requesting to see I.D for alcohol purchase or movies rated R. That's just company policy if we get caught not asking we get fired. Also black friday.

I learned that there is a right way and a wrong way to accomplish a certain task and that there is a reason to do it a certain way. The management at Walmart could have been better due to the fact that cart pushers and customer service workers seemed to get the worst of the trickle down effect. Workplace culture was generally friendly and co workers worked hard together. The hardest part of the job was staying hydrated during the hot summer as you sweated just as much water as you took in.

Just be able to scan more than 1000 items per minute, always show up, clean and with whatever smile on your face you can muster, and your day will be over before you know it. I didn't really learn much there, to be honest. I already was fairly decent with people and cash management, and scanning items faster isn't exactly something I could say I learned from them. It was all just stuff that I learned personally, but you could say my skills developed through the sheer practice of it. The hardest part about the job was dealing with the management, as they aren't really the best of people.

Stressful and Inexperienced Managers,The employees are nice but anyone above CSM is on a power trip. The pay is okay the hours are nice but the hours in which you are scheduled in are extremely random and getting a day off is almost impossible to do.

Great company that has given my family and I many opportuniities,"A typical day of work consists of walking the store an ensuring general controls are in place. Ensuring that hazardous waste and compliance is up to standard on a daily basis. Working reports, identifying shrink or potential shrink opportunities. I've learned a great deal over the years from my everyday job duties and responsibilities. Working side by side with both management and hourly associates alike is a big upside, especially when it comes to the teaching and training aspect of the business. The most difficult part of the job is to maintain my everyday job functions as well as being needed and pulled to other stores in the market to help out, but still maintain my job duties at my home store. What I enjoy most is teaching and training associates and getting the best out of them and seeing them get promoted and prosper.",4,Current Employee,Walmart Asset Protection Manager ,"Davie, FL",7/28/17,2017,7,28

Cap Team Labor,"In this job,  time pays / not production! Cashier's and Greeters get paid just as much as Cap Team associates even though cap is more physically demanding.

stressful and overworked and underpaid,Walmart has taken away all holiday pay days so there is longer no need to even come to work to get holiday pay.

Very difficult working environment with little support or work-life balance.,"A typical day at work for me was setting up registers, delegating tasks, superintending breaks and lunches, dispersing loans, and overall helping my associates. I learned to take constructive criticism with a great attitude and apply those discussions to make myself the very best manager I could be. The management and workplace culture tended to be very strained and negative. The hardest part of my job was trying to communicate with others who tended to not want to participate in the team aspect. The most enjoyable part of my job was being there for me associates. I would often compliment them, focusing on what they were doing well so they would be encouraged to continue their good work. I enjoyed discussing their families with them and giving them the support they needed. As a manager, I work for my people. I am a leader, not a boss.

"Fun and creative work environment, as a type of family.",I think they could review management in some stores but most overall is was a good experience and job as a CAP2 inventory specialist/acting supervisor.

Decent job....inadequate pay.,"I have worked at multiple stores within the company.  No two stores are alike.  For the most part the atmosphere has been favorable but the new pay restructuring is quite unfair to long term employees.  It is designed to entice new employees by offering a decent above minimum wage but they have forgotten the long term people that have kept the company going the proper way.  I have been with the company a total of 19 years.   I left and returned and have now been back for 5 years and there are new employees that have been with the company for a year or less that make almost or as much, and in some cases more than I make.  Instead of trying to keep the good employees who know how to do things the correct way for the company....they would rather pay higher rates to fly by night people that are there simply for a check and have no value or loyalty beyond the next paycheck.  Out with the old and in with the new should be the new company motto.",3,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,Mississippi,7/28/17,2017,7,28

Fair and honest place to work.,"WalMart is a good business to work for. There is a lot of room for advancement if you want it and the pay is fair for this area. Each day is a totally new experience because customers needs are so diverse. I learned how to make a pick list on the Telxon and then to pick it and stock the merchandise. At the time of my employment, management was not up to par. They have since replaced most of the management team. Trying to cover an entire department on your own while getting merchandise from the back, bring it out and stock it. I really enjoyed the comradeship of the associates in the store and the regular customers.",4,Former Employee,Associate ,"Port Orchard, WA",7/27/17,2017,7,27

fun work place but alot of internal issues,"I enjoyed my job, however management​ lacked organization. I found myself unhappy at work due to stress and drama within the department, of which management often refused to address our concerns. They often only stepped in when we were overwelmed to the point of breaking down on the job. I found work related stress and problems would affect my home life and on several occasions caused  turmoil in my relationship and with family. I missed several events and found that management was reluctant to work with me on the rare occasion I would request off. Often times one employee would be stretch though out the department and even sometimes into deli to cover open positions when we were short staffed which was fine, but it would last several months. When I started I was told we were supposed to have 12 associates in bakery alone, within 6 months it was 8 and by the time I left we were told we could have no more than 6. Which is the bare minimum to cover every position. At one point there were only 4 employees​ in bakery: a baker, two decorators, and our manager. It was a fun work environment with alot of creative freedom, but only when we all were getting along.",3,Former Employee,Cake Decorator/Bakery Clerk ,"Temple, TX",7/27/17,2017,7,27

"Rude managers and unfair ""bonus awards""","Walmart would be a better place if the hourly managers didn't treat the employees so poorly. Not everyone receives the bonus in the full amount owed and no one tells you you have to work a certain amount of hours to receive it. Have to work holidays and do not receive holiday pay because of said ""bonuses"". I worked Christmas and Thanksgiving but was not paid for it because I wasn't eligible, and was not told I would not receive the money owed me. Other employees took home money that I earned and I had to miss the time with my family. Hours keep getting cut because they keep hiring more and more employees.

Great Job,My typical day at work was different everyday which is what I loved about it. I learned to communicate with customers better and to determine what their needs were.

There were also managers that prided themselves on their ability to micromanage and punish their employees for the smallest slight. The Culture created in the stores is one resembling a family, where ""work friends"" become people that you talk to outside of work and become true friends. Pay is average for retail, with starting pay depending on past work experience, and subsequent raises being given each year to reward both tenure, and performance.

"Extroverted Job, Dynamic Environment","You're kept busy scanning and bagging items, making the workday pass by faster. Standing on two feet can be tiring. You get plenty of hours, but they're not assigned consistently at the same times and days of the week, which can be annoying when trying to schedule routine things such as school, rehearsal, or another part time job later on. When lines aren't hectic, you're left cleaning and zoning isles until there's a customer you can invite over to checkout. Managing self-checkouts was lower stress and involved less conversation, which as an introvert, was my favorite part of the job, and provided a nice break from all the forced conversations I had to initiate earlier in the day.

The management tells you things over and over again.  The things I already knows.  The hardest part is working with my co-workers, for example;  if they ask what else is needed;  while,  they were on break it will sure make a difference in keeping the work load simple.

You will not advance here either. No matter what they tell you, it will take a while before you actually move some where you wanted.

The first store I worked for had an excellent management team and I was promoted within months of being there. All of the staff there was productive and it was fun to go to work. The Walmart that I work with now is much different. The staff is friendly but not nearly as productive as they should be. When issues are brought to the attention of management you can tell that they don't care. I've been disrespected by a coworker multiple times with no response from management.

"For the most part, it was a pretty good job.","It started out easy enough in the deli, however it seemed that the more you do the more they expect from you until you are buried under so much work it is impossible to complete in the time you are given for a shift and you are constantly being coached for not completing work that should be spread between more than 3 people. I adored most all of my coworkers and I liked my boss, though I was far more comfortable as a cashier than in the bakery/deli. There almost never seemed to be enough time to dedicate to the computer training they wanted done while still completing the tasks they demanded in deli though as a cashier I had no problem keeping on top of it.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Lecanto, FL",7/24/17,2017,7,24

"fun working atmosphere, great employees, friendly customers","A typical day in the Walmart Deli depended on what shift you were scheduled for. Employees performed duties from serving customers, cooking food, prepping rotisserie chickens, making the salads and sandwiches on display, stocking shelves, ordering truck orders, and just about everything else you could imagine. We did have a great management team. The camaraderie among the employees in the deli and bakery was one of a kind.

"Fast-paced, enjoyable and friendly workplace.","A typical day at work started with me clocking in and receiving my register assignment. After receiving my assignment I'd prep my register for my shift (occasionally this would mean getting a cash drawer for the register). Once the light is on the customers start flowing; I'm ringing and bagging items, helping customers load their carts and answering their questions to the best of my ability. If I can't answer a question I find them someone who can. If the line was slow but the store was still busy I was either ""red-lining"" (drawing the customers in), organizing the candy displays at my register, clearing up trash or finding items in places they weren't meant to be and putting them in their designated bins so they could be put back in their proper places. _x000D__x000D_The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job go hand in hand - the customers. Working in retail you're always going to have a hit and miss experience with the customers - you'll either get someone REALLY nice, super energetic, fun and interesting to talk to... or you'll get someone REALLY mean, bad energy and hard to converse with - not because YOU personally have a hard time striking up a conversation but because they're simply not interested.

On a typical day, you could spend an hour running around trying to find them (uselessly).",3,Former Employee,Produce Sales Associate ,"Cape Coral, FL",7/23/17,2017,7,23
Great opportunity to work with people,"I enjoyed working as a cashier at Walmart because it gave me plenty of opportunity to interact with customers. A typical day would consist of nonstop interaction with people which made for good conversation along with learning opportunities. I learned how to effectively manage a Point of Sale System. Had I not joined the military, I probably would have stayed and progressed at Walmart.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Forsyth, IL",7/23/17,2017,7,23

"bad company, bad place to work for","Wealthiest company in the world, yet they pay their employees like they are the poorest company in the world. They do not care about their employees, will not let you get any overtime, and if you are going to go into overtime for the week, they will make you take longer lunches.",1,Former Employee,CASHIER ,"McAlester, OK 74501",7/23/17,2017,7,23
This was one of the worst jobs Ive ever had,My typical day at work consisted of me starting off in the department I was placed in. To being moved all around the store because other departments was slacking. I learned that when working for that particular store if they know that you have good work ethics they will abuse you more than trying to get the people that doesn't work at all. Management was the worst. We had an open door policy where an employee could come to management and talk to them about what ever problem they have and anything that was discussed is kept between them. I did an open door once and all my business was spread around the store and highly exaggerated. My job was pretty much easy I had a lot of down time so I didn't mind helping in other departments as long as my work was done first. There wasn't anything enjoyable about this job.,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Charlotte, NC",7/23/17,2017,7,23

The best people I ever worked with.,"First thing first.  Walmart does not care about you.  Management does not care about you.  The average person last about 3 months.  I've seen so many people come and go. One co-worker was rolled out on a stretcher, and they still gave her a point for missing work. Another one was fired from defending herself from an attacker. You will never get full time. You will work full time for part time benefits. Again Walmart does not care about you.  You are just there to make them money. I hate working for Walmart, but I loved the people I worked with; so that made it better.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Slidell, LA",7/23/17,2017,7,23
workplace,Its a lot of work. Being a CSM has its challenges. I feel like I am constantly running around between customer service and the cashiers trying to take care of customers. I have definitely learned to delegate to make sure things get done.

Productive and fun place to work.,"Walmart is definitely a productive and fun place to work. You work in a fast paced culture and many demands from customers. Management is very nice and can be at times a little stressed by demands from the company, employees and customers. The hardest part of the job is biting your tongue on matters that pull at your heart strings. The enjoyable part of the job is all the people you meet everyday and month.",5,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Blue Springs, MO",7/23/17,2017,7,23
The coworkers are cool it's just not the assistant managers or the store manager.,Management is horrible. There is no job security at all. They don't care about seniority. They will boot you out if you don't fit their click.  They're not very good at Communicating they will talk about you behind your back everyone will know your business before you do no matter how serious it is. I would like to try to open door somebody it will never fall through nothing will ever happen even if you go to corporate._x000D__x000D_ We've open the door the same assistant manage at least 10 times and nothing is happened she get so many complaints from customers and employees but yet she still there,1,Current Employee,Cap Team Associate / cashier ,"San Jose, CA",7/23/17,2017,7,23

Fast paced and understaffed,"It really depends on the store you are located in. The store I am in is in Bentonville AR so we have higher standards in comparison to other stores. I constantly have to deal with working with a crew that is half the size it needs to be. New hires last roughly 2-4 months before quitting or transferring because they hate the rush and being alone. Management refuses to hire more because we are over our hour capacity for a neighborhood market even though we are #1 in the region constantly, but they are fine giving out hours to anyone who wants it._x000D__x000D_Also, seniority doesn't exist in this company at all. The new system, customer first, is a heavy handed attempt at controlling hours. The computer generates the hours, but the managers can edit the hours seemingly without getting in trouble. This to me screams favoritism. If we don't open our hours, we won't get hours. This also meant you would be given terrible hours by the system. Either you work bad hours coming in and HOPE you get better hours (usually you don't), or constrict your hours and HOPE you get hours. New hires are shoved to night shift which is awful.",3,Current Employee,DELI SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Rogers, AR",7/22/17,2017,7,22
Great all around,"Cap 1 starts rather early (night owl since childhood) but what it loses with the early hour it makes up for with a comfortable working environment, friendly co-workers, great pay, good morale, and frequent communication. Working there, I didn't really have any difficulties save for how early I had to come in and how my time there ended. I greatly enjoyed working there and the managers expressed their appreciation for my time there. In all honesty, I'm hoping that I can be re-employed with the company again. I would gladly recommend them.",5,Former Employee,Cap 1 Team Member ,"Michigan City, IN",7/22/17,2017,7,22

No incentive for employees,"The dynamics and set up for part-time employees are less than favorable for the workers. No pay raise is offered for 90 days and that's only at the completion of the computer training, no form of benefits for one year and the starting pay rate is low for certain areas of the store.

The people you work with are great but that's about it,"I really thought Wal-mart would be a great place to work.  Veteran friendly, they were the first company to reach their hand out and said ""come on in"". The only thing about Wal-mart is that each store is ran differently, so my experience at store A is completely different than somebody who works at store K. There was (is) a high turnover of managers in the store.  The most consistent part of working here is its inconsistencies. Store A; everybody was treated as if they were expendable, so there is no family type atmosphere.",2,Former Employee,Asset Protection/Customer Service Host ,"New Bern, NC",7/22/17,2017,7,22
Typical,"Working for this company you will have your good and bad. They say they work with your schedule which is not true, and if you need to be with your family in an emergency they could care less it will still count against you. You have the certain management who is awesome at their job and then the ones who are power hungry and act like they're not replaceable.

And, unless you work your butt off to be higher up, they only give you part time because they don't pay for insurance. Although you do get benefits like discounts. That's about it.

I learned that speed and accuracy are the key to being successful in this job role. I loved my manager, she was one of those rare managers that were actually there if you needed her. The hardest part of the job honestly for me was keeping up my speed after the temperature reaching its peak in the warehouse. The most enjoyable part was working and getting to meet my co-workers.

Works with school/other life needs however terrible management and ethical issues.,"Was a great job while attending college, very flexible, I was put in the electronics department with a fairly good pay. However, management issues and other conflicts make this job dim and can put departments on edge. Communication between management needs to improve as well as with their associates. Loved this job for the 2 years I have worked here, however, it has recently gone down hill, at least for my store. Lots of good people left, and lazy people got hired. Too many changes/expectations and lazy upper management who seem bugged to help their fellow associates with simple things like unlocking an area or part of the backroom.

"Great first job, bad career","Walmart is great for just starting out. But it is not a great career. Management is lazy. The only time they come out of their offices is zone time. Corporate comes up with the shifts that schedule people and the store is ALWAYS short handed. Even a Monday or Tuesday at Walmart feel like a Friday or Saturday because of corporate who never come into our store, make up our schedules. It always feels like doing the work of 3 people. The only suggestion I have is if you want to make Walmart a career, go into upper level management. Most of the stress if with the associates on the floor. And the customers treat you like you are an uneducated person. And they will not take doctors notes. A point is a point. Even if you or a family member are in the hospital._x000D__x000D_There are some benefits too. The pay is one of the best in the area for a grocery store. You meet some pretty great people.

While Walmart has the resources to bring in top talents around the world, it has yet to learn how to keep these talents. The advancement opportunities are challenging to say the least;  ranks, status, and class are extremely important as much as they tell you otherwise; innovation from the rank and file are not embraced, but once the senior management decided something has to be done it is their way or highway. The ""open door policy"" is a joke. You will be thrown out the door if you ever dare to challenge your management for their wrong doing or dishonesty. In my two years I have seen at least 12 rounds of layoffs at this company. Too much instability and uncertainty.",3,Current Employee,Senior Manager II Compliance Analytics ,"Bentonville, AR",7/20/17,2017,7,20

Not Bad,Walmart is not what everyone makes it seem it actually ok. The Walmart i worked at was good the managers were super understanding mostly when i needed some absence leave for personal issue.

Productive atmosphere,"I've learned that Walmart is a very fair company that will work with you and train you to be able to take that next step. Management is great to be around, and they are great teachers. The hardest part of my job is having to discipline an associate, whether its just holding that associate accountable for their work/actions, or even having to terminate an associate. One other hard part is the large amount of freight we receive on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to satisfy a customer, put a smile on their face, and have them wanting to return to my store. Another enjoyable part of my day is all of my coworkers who support me and make the job that much better.",4,Current Employee,Support Manager ,"Alexandria, VA",7/20/17,2017,7,20
"Good money, horrible environment","I made great money for being an 18 year old man, but it was a horrible job. The managers were very unfair and rarely told the truth.

Hard work,As long the management know your skills and capabilities are they will place you to that situation BUT they will not give you the proper raise you deserve. Walmart stayed on 40 cent raise to everybody. It does not matter what are your skills are. Walmart avoids the chaos between employees why other employee got higher raise than other. So they stayed 40 cent on every employee.,3,Former Employee,Tire and Lube Technician ,"Austin, TX",7/19/17,2017,7,19
Its okay but not great,"Walmart is an all around average place to work. My experience was mostly positive. The management team wasn't awful, however, most days management did not communicate with one another, causing quite a bit of confusion. Breaks were usually late but that was mostly due to supervisors staggering breaks for coverage. Policies such as the attendance policy are generally regarded with contempt by most associates. Despite certain issues working at Walmart was not awful, in fact, for the longest time, I loved working there because after a short while it felt like I had a secondary family, due to the fact that there are some really wonderful people who work there.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,Washington State,7/19/17,2017,7,19

work tasks easy but communications with managers could be difficult,"Overall job was good, but management would contradict other management.

I believe that having a strong management team builds strong and respectful associates. The workplace culture here at WalMart is great and very clean even the guys whom unload the trucks have a clean job. The hardest part of the job is knowing where items are when a customer ask.

Too many bosses. Expectations unrealistic.,"WalMart is one of the biggest retail company and although this company strives to live by its trendy goal - ""Live Better, Live Longer""; the company fails to properly communicate between levels of staff and management. The company seems to care to about its employees in some form or another. But management messes it up by giving an employees' fluctuating schedule work schedule to where the employee cannot make plans for their personal life. In general, WalMart is a good place to work but there ARE TOO many bosses and no one seems to know what the other manager is doing - so that leaves the associate in the ""what do i do now?"" and causes stress to the employee._x000D_So if WalMart DID stand up for its employees and STOP putting unrealistic expectations on its employees, the company would achieve even higher bottom line $$$$$.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lincoln, NE",7/19/17,2017,7,19

Stressful institution with a hostile workplace environment,"I worked in the Walmart deli for a long enough time to say that this was the worst experience I've ever had, and definitely the worst one, in terms of the quality of the clientele.  In addition, the managerial staff simply seemed not to care for their employees, at all.  They would often times come over, however, simply to say that you will be covering someone else's closing shift.  The managerial staff didn't seem to care about looking into any customer discrepancies either, as they would immediately after hearing from the customer, coach the employee in question, without trying to hear their side of the story.  This job is a high-volume job (people quit often) as it doesn't pay enough to deal with the kind of, antagonistic, patrons the employees face every single day.",1,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Waukesha, WI",7/18/17,2017,7,18

The work is great but lots of favoratism.,"A typical day as a Customer Service Manager consists of getting cashiers change, doing price checks and answering customer questions.

Strict attendance rules,"My review of the job I had at Walmart supercenter I did like the job but the only thing that I did not like about the job was the point scale which is based off of  your attendance.

They don't care if you have a health problem or anything you still had to be at work.",3,Former Employee,walmart cashier ,"Baton Rouge, LA",7/18/17,2017,7,18
It depends on the store you work in...,"Unfortunately, I was in a store that had a bad management team most of the time. Too many ""favorites"" while the rest of us had management on us at all times.

I learned you had to zone before and after your shift. Plus sort out returns.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Danville, KY",7/18/17,2017,7,18
Fast paced environment with good coworkers,"Walmart is trying its best to keep up with the needs of entry level workers by raising their storewide minimum wage to 10 an hour. However, with that raise comes strict rules and hour cuts that leave you on a barebones schedule of 10-16 hours a week for part timers. You will be expected to do the work of at least 3 people in four hours, and will be coached or warned if you don't get your duties done in those few hours. If you are clever and lucky enough to convince management to lock you into full time, you are given twice the workload and will be coached if you even toe the line of overtime. Management does not seem to take into account how disruptive customers are to work, and how often a person may come and ask you a question. Given that on a busy day, you can expect to be interrupted at least two hours worth, you will need to do a full 8 hours of work in the remaining two hours or be reprimanded.",3,Current Employee,Cake Decorator/Bakery Clerk ,North Carolina,7/18/17,2017,7,18

Not Too Bad,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers and answering phone calls.

Stressful and crazy,This job is very unpredictable. The hours were typically crazy and unpredictable. Some weeks I would work 40+ hours other weeks I was lucky to get 25. The good part to that was if I needed less hours I could easily give my hours to someone who did not have as many that week. I was trained in almost every part of the store so I never really knew what I was going to walk into the next day. The pay was not bad but at times I was managing people and making less than them ( at one point I was managing and training new hires and making the same amount as them). My managers that I directly worked with did make things better by making sure I knew how useful and appreciated I was. They always had my back and tried to make the workplace better as they could.,4,Former Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER ,Central FL,7/17/17,2017,7,17

I have learned to keep a positive attitude, smile and greet the customer with ""Hi, how are you doing today?"". The management at Walmart is excellent, they always listen to what I have to say, they keep our customers happy. The hardest part of my job would have to be when a problem gets difficult and I have to adjust and help out as much as I can, also its hard to not stress out when our lines are long. Number 1 priority is to keep our customers happy and get the lines down as fast as possible. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the older couples who come in and have the greatest conversations with me, I learn so much from it. I also love helping with carry outs, I enjoy helping others with things such as loading there groceries in there cars or having the one on one with the customer. I enjoy my job, it helps me learn how to deal with difficult situations.",5,Current Employee,Cashier and Customer Service ,"Lawton, OK",7/17/17,2017,7,17
My Recent Walmart Experience,"I've previously worked at Walmart as a Overnight Stocker, but then became apart of a Overnight Remodel team at a different Walmart. Management was a joke.

It's walmart,"I'm not gonna sugar coat it, it is a great job for a college student, because it shows you what you are working to avoid. minimum wage is what is commonly available, although the minimum wage is rising in my area. the hours do not pass quickly and you are either busy or not. and the hours of standing around doing nothing do not balance out the sudden rush of surprisingly often angry customers. when i was a cashier they would be disgruntled about my not discounting items to negative cost for them. when i was a customer service desk worker they were mad when i wouldn't return things with a Goodwill receipt.at walmart, the customer is never happy, no matter what you do, but you still try your best and they leave a little less angry at least, so you hope. the management will do their best to assist you when they can and they do a very good job of helping you when you ask.",3,Former Employee,"Customer Service Associate, Cashier and Stockman ","Lincoln, NE",7/17/17,2017,7,17

"Go in with the right expectations, and have them met.","The most important thing to remember about any job is that it isn't about you; it's about the company. As such, one's expectations should always be that the company's welfare as a whole is first and foremost in the eyes of employers. Walmart as a company does, on the whole, a very good job of balancing company welfare with care for the lives of its workers, and so long as you accept a position with the company understanding that the business' main goal is to earn a profit then you're in for a good, fair work experience._x000D__x000D_While this applies to the work experience for the company as a whole, it should be noted that individual stores do have their own quirks and inner-office politics which can make this experience better or worse.

Chaos,"My experience with Walmart is that this generation has completely forgotten that Sam Walton built his company on excellent customer service and the culture he created dictated that his associates are important. I found that management is completely disengaged from its associates, is disrespectful and sometimes does not adhere to their own policies, such as scheduling associates outside of their availability or even greeting customers and/or offering assistance._x000D_  The moral at our location is very low because a lot of associates I've talked to do not feel appreciated or receive help when needed._x000D_  On a typical day, I would come in and have to wait, sometimes 20 minutes, before a manager would come to unlock the liquor box. Occasionally, I would have several customers walk in with me and wait while I turned on the lights, and  put money in the register. On delivery day,  a truck would already be pulled up, waiting to unload._x000D_  At least one day a week, I received a delivery of 120-150 cases of merchandise that I had to stock, usually without help. Most days my breaks were late or skipped and sometimes I had to stay late because there were holes in the schedule._x000D_  I was considered a cashier, but I also performed a lot of tasks that were a department manager's job in the store. Cashiers in  the store do not stock shelves or set up end caps or change pricing labels. But in the liquor store, I did all that in addition to communicating with vendors about stock and specials. _x000D_  Stocking shelves was hard, especially in the cooler.

Throw boxes all day,Works as a meat and produce orderfiller. Like any job it has good days and bad days. It's a production based job which has pros and cons but mostly cons. Pay is good. Typical day is clock in have a quick 10 min meeting and stretch then it's 9 to 10 hrs of moving boxes of meat and produce. With boxes varying from 1lbs  to meat boxes that weigh 90lbs. It's a workout!!! Seems a lot like the upper management sees most of us production workers as replaceable so they don't care about the workers as much. You're easily replaceable and You're just a number to them. High turnover rates so the few of us that are good workers get the shaft on that. Lots of stupid rules. Call in sick for a day they take 10hrs of your vacation pay no questions asked. Claim safety is the number one thing but don't care if you have to orderfill 6 straight days @ 120% plus. You really do need your off days to recover. _x000D__x000D_Overall I do like to work here. It's great pay and if you work hard production isn't that difficult.

"Walmart was an alright job, good pay","Walmart is an average retail job really, do your job and you will have no issues, some days were chaotic while others were fairly relaxed. However i would not work for walmart if you have anything going on in your life that prevents you from going to work. i was attending school and working here and while i did enjoy the pay and i did like my job i did get fired for 5 absences over the course of 8 months. They need to realize that people have things pop up out of their control sometimes. I had strep throat for 5 days and thats what caused me to lose my job regardless if you have a doctors note or not, you have to go through their stupid program called sedgeway or something like that and that can take up to months. One of my co workers was fired before Sedgeway could supply the proof of his absences. Its very risky if you have bills you need to pay monthly. Luckily i had a huge amount saved up and was able to pay my vehicle off before i lost it. Some walmarts do not have this issue but this is still a really big issue for those that do.

The job is physically exhausting, and for the lack of healthcare provided, feels unsatisfying for the lack of pay to make up for the lack of care._x000D_ It is nice to hear the gratitude from helping customers, and a few of the managers we may need to help. The discount given, while small, does add up. If healthcare was provided or our pay made enough of a difference to pay for proper healthcare, the job would be a little more recommendable.

Terrible place to work,Working for walmart was the worst experience of my life. What I learned most from working there is the harder you work the worse you get treated by everyone. I was confused when people started tell me to slow down because nobody wants to work that fast they all just want to get the bare minimum done. It does not matter how good of a job you do you will never advance in the company unless you are good friends with management unfortunately that's the way it is. The hardest part of working there is most of your Co workers are anger and depressed because thats how everybody gets after working the first month. Unfortunately there really was not anything enjoyable about my few years I spent there but I did get to meet a very few good people I would call my friend. It would be a good starter job for a high school kid or a collage student but not a career.,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"280 woodward Dr westminster, md 21158",7/10/17,2017,7,10

Gainful employment,"The company does provide gainful employment. It does also provide very good benefits. What the company fails at is on the store level themselves. Each store is literally like a family of junior high/high schoolers. The managers, from store management down to the lowest level of management, basically, Customer Service managers as lowest management, routinely plays off of favorites, picking and choosing what policies to apply to what person and etc. The company itself does provide great benefits and employment. But, as with just about any company, you have to deal with managers that do not follow any protocols the way they should, open door policies broken constantly, never being fully consistent with policies in place for attendance and so on. A job is a job is a job. A career is a career. To pay bills and make it paycheck to paycheck, its great for. To actually achieve better in your life then just paycheck to paycheck, no it is not. The company truly needs to take a more in depth look at each of its stores and the management that runs them and the out right bulliness and inconsistancies with policies and procedures that the stores themselves flip in what ever way they can use for their own abilities versus treating each person exactly the same and with in the guidelines of the policies versus their favorites and childish games.",2,Former Employee,Various Positions ,"Pass Christian, MS",7/10/17,2017,7,10

From time to time I would help customers' load their groceries in their shopping cart. When I had free time, I would stock candy in all of the register aisles to make sure they were stocked. What I learned from working at Walmart is you can always get stuff done a lot faster when you work together. I also learned that working hard and putting in the time and effort pays off in the long run. The managers were very friendly and understanding. They would work with you on your schedule if it needs to be changed or if you have a problem with another associate. They always do their best to make sure you have what you need. The workplace culture was very positive and you just feel like you're working with family. The people you work with are like your family and they always brought a smile to my face and made the time go by a lot faster. The hardest part of the job I think is dealing with upset customers' and trying to figure out the problem and fix it so they leave satisfied and come back. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was helping customers and making sure they were satisfied with the service they received. Talking to the customers' was nice because they could always find a way to make you smile. And I always had my regular customers.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Urbana, OH",7/9/17,2017,7,9

It was a fast paste environment,working at Walmart i would go into my department and immediately start answering the phones or letting customers into the fitting room. i learned a lot about how to answer phone  calls from customers and i learned a lot about the different departments to help navigate for customers. It was pretty easy to communicate with management daily on phone calls and to get help for customers. The hardest part I believe would be at night fixing all the merch after a long day. I enjoyed answering the phone and using the walkie to talk to management.

"Laid back, hectic, and everything in between","If there's one thing I can say about my time at Walmart, it's that it was an experience.

I tend to rely on my supervisors to get my breaks, assigned door, and my schedule, though we tend to clash sometimes if I feel something is not quite right. Despite this, my managers are usually willing to see my point of view, and usually we can reach a reasonable conclusion. The only challenge I faced there was getting hungry or overheating in the garden center, but these were easy to remedy when I voiced my concern.

Depends on the person,It could be a great job depending on your mentality and work ethic.

Not for everyone,"Typical day began with stocking shelves with new product then zoning and removing items left in the electronics department. It was also important to straighten up DVD and Blue-ray movies, gaming accessories, and other items to make the area neat and appealing. Supervisors were the main suppliers of direction on what needed to be done on a daily or weekly basis. Managers would usually run through the area once or twice a day as they were responsible for other areas. I learned locations of movies and electronic accessories. Learned how to deal with customers who did not know exactly what they wanted, and customers who knew what they wanted and were upset when we didn't have that item. The workplace culture was customer oriented, fast paced, and actually fun. The hardest part of the job was trying to stock shelves per direction of the supervisors, when the shelves had no room for the product they wanted to be stocked.

"Decent pay, but not the best job for it","Majority of the time the management are willing to listen and to help you, but usually you have to be best friends with them too. The people who are the most willing to go in and put their time in to get a paycheck and leave will not prosper at Walmart. You have to be willing to make alliances with your coworkers because they are the ones that will calm you down and keep you sane when customers, management, or other coworkers get on your last nerve; and they most certainly will on an almost hourly rate. I did enjoy my time with this company and would be willing to return in a heartbeat, you just have to know how to let things roll off your shoulder and not get to you, but that is the nature of retail in general.

Terrific Working Hours,"A newer FC in the Walmart ecommerce world, but the software running the building is an issue, causing problems for associates to complete the work efficiently. When updates to the system are made, they fail to include those doing the work to fully implement what changes are actually needed, or even what changes are going to be made.

This may come from the top leadership, believing they know what's best for the workforce without consulting the workforce adequately?_x000D_A majority of the communication does not flow downward to the workforce, causing inefficient work practices.

I enjoyed being a cashier because I was a fast learner and a hard worker. I've helped all around the store and learned to run the Customer Service Center. I've covered breaks for people in Deli or CSMs since I've learned their positions.

High Expectations for Production & Quality,"Important:  The only department guaranteed a 40-hour week is maintenance.  And managers, I guess.  Think carefully before you take a job at the distribution center.  Sure, a good wage is offered; but what if you're getting just 35 hours per week?  Or struggling to get 30 from January to May?  Is that wage going to provide you the weekly income you need?_x000D__x000D_If you can make your weekly production and quality goals, great!  If not....  You'll be looking for another job.  The distribution center is a tough job - for any position.  Lots of people like it; wasn't for me.

Can be rewarding but very stressful .,"While I love being to help people with their prescriptions and other services the pharmacy provides it seems like the goals of individuals from corporate have changed.

Fun People To Work With But Poor Management,"-A typical day of work at Walmart for me varied from day to day. Usually I would start off by doing my normal job which consisted of going around my areas, which was assigned to me by my Support Manager, and making sure everything on the shelves were in order and pulled forward along with making sure nothing hazardous was on the floor or on the shelves themselves while also putting merchandise back where it belonged and of course making sure every customer was finding what they were looking for. Usually either at the beginning or halfway through my shift I would be called on my walkie talkie to come up and help cashier when the lines were getting long, I would usually be up there for about 4 or 5 hours if not more out of my 9 hour shift which sometimes was very upsetting to me because most of the time I would never be left with enough time to go back and finish the zones my Support Manager gave me often leaving me with either having to stay late or go home leaving an unfinished job. _x000D__x000D_-What I learned from Walmart is that I have to work hard, fast and efficient so that way if I am called to somewhere else I have less to do when I get back. I have also learned that in being part of a team that works well together I have to sometimes help others with their job so that way they can have a better understanding of what to do in the future. _x000D__x000D_-Management to say kindly was very inefficient. They showed very little appreciation for the workers under them and also showed very little care/attention to those who came to them and tried to talk with them about days off and personal issues. - more...",2,Former Employee,Hardware Sales Associate ,"Lakeville, MN",7/6/17,2017,7,6

"Good company, bad managers","Walmart is a great company to work for they have good benefits for working there a long time, but they should chose their department managers more smartly.

Stressful,"a typical day running reports and managing supplier needs, Management team are not so good there's alot a micro managing. The culture of the company is nothing like it was a few years ago and based on seasonal employees its not what Sam Walton based his company on.

Hectic work environment,I enjoyed the people and the staff members that I worked with. They just expected way too much out of one employee. Associates that worked 20 or more years didnt have health coverage. You were required to do the work of three people for little pay. They wouldnt allow anyone to be hired on full time so no one can claim any benefits through the company. They will work you to the bone and hardly give recognition for good customer service.

Making money by cutting wages,"Been a manager at Walmart for years now and it is only getting worse. They preach work life balance to new hires, but fully expect management to make miracles from nothing. Limited management in stores are running around all day, unlocking doors, talking to customers, overriding transactions, holding meetings, listening to conference calls... given very little time in their assigned departments to actually do what they need to, then reprimanded when things are not complete as should be. The pay seems great, but not for what you put in! Management will work at MINIMUM 10 hour days 5x per week, with never a chance to sit and take an hour lunch as promised in orientation. Management is forced to make their associates happy and bend over backwards for everything they want, yet no one above the assistant managers are looking out for their level.",2,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Philadelphia, PA",7/6/17,2017,7,6

Misleading expectations,"You have the opportunity to have different shifts, and bonus on your performance. However, if you are very efficient, you may get a bonus, but then you are sent home, so the bonus just barely covers the wages you are losing for leaving early. One shift is said they do 33 hours at least, but there are many weeks that you might only work 25-27 if you are scoring above 100% for efficiency, so the incentive doesn't really help.",3,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Olney, IL",7/6/17,2017,7,6
It was fun and productive on busy days.,I was a cashier and I loved it. I was only responsible for my register and the customers that came through my line.

Overnights,Good pay. Great support managers.  Terrible upper management. Overnight people have to do whatever 2nd shift didn't finish and whatever 1st shift should be doing as well as what over nights is meant to do.

The people i worked with and the support manager were the only reasons i stayed as long as i did.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"McAlester, OK",7/6/17,2017,7,6
It was okay.,"The job had its ups and downs. A typical day included picking boxes from the back room, loading them onto a cart and then stocking the shelves. This is what i did for most of the day. In between this i would have to constantly help customers, even if that meant walking across the store to help them find a product. Sometimes i would encounter rude customers but i had to always maintain a respectful tone. I would also be called up to help cashier multiple times a day. I would be doing that from anywhere to 15 minutes or even a few hours, depending on how busy it was. A lot of the time this caused me to not be able to finish my work i started that morning. At the end of the day i would have to put all over stock away, dispose of my trash, and prepare for the next day. I would say it was a good first job. I learned how to deal with customers and my coworkers right away. It was an environment that I had to quickly adapt to. Management provided little training. I had to figure a lot of things on my own, even after asking someone to help me. Each day was different.",3,Former Employee,Toys Sales Associate ,"Greeley, CO",7/6/17,2017,7,6

The employees were friendly for the most part. the hardest thing was going back to the computers to do pathways and CBLs. The most enjoyable thing was talking with customers.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,North Carolina,7/6/17,2017,7,6
Horrible,"Beech Grove Walmart not only has a bad reputation, but it is disgusting. No manager there cares about your life outside of work. Doctors notes do not count as excused, so if you're sick or plan to be out of work for a few days in the hospital, plan to find a new job. _x000D__x000D_heartless company with the worst pay._x000D_I worked there for a total of 5 years starting off as a Cashier moving my way up to Customer Service Manager. _x000D__x000D_My pay started off at $7.25/hour and after FIVE YEARS and moving up to a managers position I was only up to $10.80/hour.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Beech Grove, IN",7/6/17,2017,7,6
Great place to learn what you would like to learn,"I can't say a whole lot of what I liked about Walmart, but I will say this, they taught me how to decorate cakes. That was something I had always wanted to learn.I liked the people and management at the store I worked at, however when I transferred to a different store, I was not happy at all. You have absolutely no life when you work at a Walmart store. They pretty much control how your life goes. I will say though, the benefits are excellent and the pay is really good, and you do get regular raises, and plenty of opportunities to advance.",2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Three Rivers, MI",7/6/17,2017,7,6

Ok,"I was a caps 2 member, for the most part I moved items from the trucks onto pallets and moved this to the floor.

"Fun,fun","A typical day at work was taking care of my customers and there needs. I learned to be patient with customers especially the aged. I learned that everyone deserves to be treated with respect(whether they give you that same respect or not. Our management left a lot to be desired(I believe that because it's a high volume store and the next nearest store was far away). The workplace culture was fairly good,we cashiers made our work fun because we tried to keep things lite and as cheery as possible. The hardest part of the job was the customer volume that we had in our store(I liked the fact we didn't have a lot of down time). The most enjoyable part of the job was the cashiers and how we interacted with each other. We made our time as fun as possible.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate/Pharmacy Cashier ,"Phillipsburg, NJ",7/6/17,2017,7,6

I would recommend this job to high school students,"work was always heavy and the team shift leaders were very unproductive and lazy, too causal. Never wanted to help or train new employees, managers were rarely there so if you ever had any questions too bad, customers were very rude and nasty and foul, would allow there kids to complete destroy merchandise and not pick up any thing ,would leave all kinds of clothing in the aisle and floors, the shoe department was always hideous , unorganized, they would always fire the good employees and keep the lazy , instigating , nosy , always on their phone on the work floor,",1,Former Employee,Retail Sale Associate ,"Cicero, IL",7/6/17,2017,7,6

Daily life at walmart,"Walmart is a very nice place to work. Unfortunately it is hard to support a family being a single parent. I need to make more, I have been told it is easy to move up. You just have to get in with the management. So far I have come to find out that they pick and choose who they want for that position and their minds are made up before they interview for that particular job. I am sure it is not always true for every Walmart you go into. I do enjoy my job and the people I work with. It is my home away from home and my Walmart family really is amazing. I love working there but unfortunately being a single parent I have come to the conclusion I must look for something that will help support us more.

"Stressful, unnecessarily complicted, no life balance at all","Hourly employees are knowledgeable and dedicated but are typically shown little or no respect at locations in this geographic area. Condescending attitudes of management leads to resentment and low morale. The training and culture at some Academies is excellent but once assigned to a store location, one finds the culture of ""respect for the individual"" goes right out the door along with many disgruntled customers. New assistant managers sign on to manage a number of departments (an area). They are not told up front that they will be expected to manage the entire store, rotate divisions (including midnight stockroom for 6-12 month stretches) or that they may be required to stay well-beyond their scheduled 10 hour shifts.",1,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Canton, OH",7/5/17,2017,7,5

Good for some people. Could be better,"Takes years to get on a decent shift. Mostly Manual labor. Receiving isn't too bad. Some jobs are harder than others, more physical.

The culture of this workplace is very positive although you are required to be speedy, there are minimal negative people in your midst.

Learning aspects from past employment has brought training expierences, different locations, climate differences, working with diversity of associates, different types of jobs, be it warehouse, manufacturing, or other. Management for the most part depended on initiative to do the job, attitude of want to, dependability, integrity. Workplace culture has been acceptable in most cases, caring about associates safety, and providing tools to do the job. The hardest thing about any job is lack of concern for safety or rules.

Stressful,Walmart is a very good company to work for but they do not approve overtime. You can work full time but when you apply they tell you they only hire for part time.

TLE is the way to go.,"Unless things have changed, if you're going to work at Walmart, go for the TLE.

It's okay to a certain extent,"The typical day at work for me is sometimes having to watch 10 self check out registers by yourself along with keeping maintenance. Sometimes you'll fill overworked by watching 10 registers, cleaning, taking care of ten customers, price checking, stocking, doing with the manager asks, asking for Walmart credit cards, watching for stolen credit cards and scams and watching for shrink with try to get items back or get customers to pay for it.

Terrible managers that choose favorites, won't work with you if you have a mental/ physical illness, and not to mention they pick and pick at certain employees until they run them out of there!! They treat us like dirt! They let the customers treat their employees like dirt and get away with it cause ""we want to make everyone happy and the customer comes before you"" Also worthy of knowing is they refuse to work with you on your schedule no matter what the situation. If you can't handle certain hours because of illnesses. Well too bad for you the customer comes first!! That's why they hired you!! To be a work horse they can use and abuse!! Please, please, PLEASE  if you can avoid working at this establishment I would. This ""family oriented and employee friendly company"" is a big fat joke, they are the worst.

It's A Trap,"Although Wal-Mart makes it seem like they only hire the best and they love promoting from within, it's just a lot of talk that sounds good and looks good on paper. They do not respect even the hardest working employees and they reprimand you if you have to go to the doctor or if you have to take a Leave of Absence for an unexpected problem. They favor a lot of their people and make the one's they don't like do all of the work. They won't train their people or try to cultivate leaders. They'll send you to a ""training academy"" that basically restates all of the messages they divulge throughout the day.

Walmart is a good place to learn how to work with the public.,Working at Walmart was a good experience for me.

its a fast past working area that gets you close with customers and your job.,i typical day is like coming in to make customers happy and to be very respectful. i learned to have patience stay calm and do your job. Sometimes the managers would  get kind of bossy at times when everyone is working and sometimes are to over powering. the hardest part is when you do not have help or your stuck in the same spot and you do not have no one by your side but that is all about becoming independent. What i mostly enjoyed was when everything and everyone is happy and there is no slacking and also making money.,5,Former Employee,sales associate ,"Rosedale, MD",7/1/17,2017,7,1
"Good starting position, not great for long term","At my location, promotion was hard sought and rarely rewarded. At the time, there was no cohesiveness, some bitterness, and little show of companionable togetherness among the team. It was rare to receive full time unless you worked night shift, so you can obtain benefits after you've been there several months and years, depending on the type you need. Turnover was high, management was hit-and-miss communicating or helpful, depending on the person. Not a lot of togetherness or a feeling of teamwork enforced among the group, but we made do on our own and worked as a team to make ourselves more efficient. Eventually we got more inclusion managers and departments worked well with us. I really enjoyed having a lot to do and learn, helping out managers when I can do to their turnover and need for more hands to lighten the load.

The culture in walmart is very strict always to be on time and welcoming to everyone around you. Hardest part of the job is keeping yourself busy as you quickly run out of thing to do for the day. Things that i enjoyed of the job was the customer service you get to meet all kinds of people and you always felt better helping other people out,2,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance Associate ,"Pearl City, HI",7/1/17,2017,7,1

Fast paced,Was a fun and fast paced environment and the coworkers were great to get along with.  The only downside was management.

It could be a great job with oppurtunity if you get the right management team.,I have worked for Walmart for 6 years and been in two different stores. My first store I had no problem with and everyone was kind and helped you learn and build. The second store I am at the management team does not help you build and grow.

CSM's were good with the exception of 2  one that refuse to look when action codes are sent for change, etc. the One CSM will work but is constantly on her phone CONSTANTLY and the other CSM is beyond lazy no idea why she would of been promoted to CSM when she was a lousy cashier. Not a good example to employees when we're told phone use is not permitted. The turn over in this store is due to rude management and lack of respect for employees under them.

Not Horrible,Overall I felt like too much of a number there where good work often went unnoticed. Much of the senior management was incredibly uninvolved with the work that went on there and the training process was nearly non existent. Many people working there got away with taking excessively long breaks throughout the day which often went unnoticed. The pay was pretty mediocre and advancement seemed to come from sucking up instead of doing your job well. _x000D__x000D_They could improve the job by adding more structure and daily goals and taking notice of those who do well.,2,Former Employee,Frozen/Dairy Associate ,"East Windsor, CT",6/29/17,2017,6,29

"Productive, almost like high school.","Typical day would be checking out customers, receive their payments and coupons, stock shelves, clean the front end. I learned how to smile when you deal with a difficult customer and how to use their point of sale system to the fullest to help employees and customers alike. Management seem to be on different pages as I would be told to do one thing by one and another thing by the other and get in trouble for doing one or the other and not what the 2nd manager told me to do. The culture in the workplace reminds me of high school. Everyone has their own cliques, many love to spread rumors, and a few just don't care of their coworkers or the customers. The hardest part of the job is when you have to smile and continue on your day when a customer is verbally assaulting you and the management isn't stepping up to defend you. Honestly, I don't know what part of it was really enjoyable for me. But, if I was to guess. It would probably be when you got 10% discount for all foods but alcohol and milk from the beginning of November to the first of January.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Pittsburg, KS",6/29/17,2017,6,29

People can be in your business,The work environment can't be fun when you make friends with the associates and management. They do say they are like a family there which is sometimes true but other times people can be rude and in your business when they dont know you personally. I do believe it's like a high school there. People start and spread rumors even if you keep to yourself and focus on work. You can't stop people no matter what. And sometimes management will help and other times they dont really do much about it. I wouldn't really recommend this job. I could only stand it there for so long.

Overall a decent place to work,I have worked at Walmart for over two years now and overall it has been a decent place to work. Typically my job consists of helping customers while solving problems with freight and overall department cleanliness. I've learned that often times problems that seem impossible to solve at first always have a solution. The key is to be flexible and adaptable to your situation. Management is knowledgeable and helpful most of the time; everyone has their off days. Working here you will make new friends and develop good personal relationships as well as professional relationships. The hardest part of the job is the stress one gets from pressing time constraints. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of accomplishing all of your tasks in a given day as well as the smiles one receives from customers when the job is well done.,3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Waxahachie, TX",6/29/17,2017,6,29

Energetic and Challenging work environment,"Working at Wal-Mart was a great experience. As an Overnight Associate, I learned the value of hard work and timeliness. Every associate is part of a team that relies on each other to get the store ready for business and keeps it looking and running like a well-oiled machine.

Busy workplace,"Working at the busiest Walmart teaches you to watch your temper and have patience.  A typical 8 hour day consists of answering many customer questions, packing out freight on the sales floor, and constantly cleaning up messy shelves.  Management do what they can, but some probably need a bit more training  to become more qualified to even hold that title as they are sometimes clueless.  Associates and department managers pretty much keep the store up and running .  The associates in the store,although sometimes segregated to their cliques all get along and enjoy each others company.  Our lunch breaks are probably the most enjoyable part of the day where we actually get to relax and unwind.  The hardest part of the job is when we're pressured to do multiple tasks while trying to help and move through the customers all while trying to keep the store safe and clean.",3,Current Employee,Cashier/ Sales Associate ,"Valley Stream, NY",6/28/17,2017,6,28

Job Review,"Walmart was my first real job. When I decided to go back to my school, the company told me I was at risk for losing my job because it wasn't business related it was medical. I had to change my availability so I could go to school. Several times I was scheduled when I had school, which caused me to have lates, and incomplete shifts. Management was constantly changing and the rules were always bent for certain associates. Working at Walmart I realized I was only a number. They could hire someone as soon as they fired someone. When I went on maternity leave, I was told to use my vacation or take leave with no pay. So I used all my vacation time and I sold my car to pay my bills while I was on leave. I would use Walmart as only a last resort for a job.",3,Former Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER ,"Milford, DE",6/28/17,2017,6,28

Management Problems,Company always seemed to be under inspection and the location for our store was extremely dangerous.

One of many I'm sure.,"The best way to summarize Wal-Mart is that every store is completely different than another. Some stores have great environments that are fun, productive and satisfying while others are miserable, myopic and sometimes downright stupid._x000D_The good: Great pay. Mandatory break periods. Flexibility as far as implementing some changes._x000D_The bad: Great pay leads to great scrutiny. There are cliques like every other company and I would suggest you join one ASAP. Otherwise, your great pay is going to lead to great excuses to fire you._x000D_The ugly: Management. Managers are micro-managing CONSTANTLY. And this is hunky-dorey if you have a competent, humble, optimistic manager who is secure with his/her sexuality, the Wal-Mart world is your oyster. If you have a moronic, frustrated closet-homosexual manager who really doesn't care about doing tasks other than his own way (which isn't even the Wal-Mart practice), then you're going to have a bad time.

Productive strong team orientented co workers,Best thing was the bonding with co workers and how well we worked as a team when we were short handed. Upper management considered us the best team he has ever worked with and had the reputation of completing the impossible. Now some management do tend to contradict each other which would cause problems and corporate I'd argue will make poor policy changes that would hurt the entire job process.

Not the worst,"Walmart is definitely a job to acquire flexibility, patience, endurance, and many other skills. It is a fast-pace environment and requires an ability to be flexible, policies change often, job demands change often, and just about every thing is subjective. If you need a job to just scrape by, and need flexibility with your schedule, depending on your management staff and relations, they'll work with you. However, the pay is not nearly enough to fully support a family. Right out of high school and near /after retirement this place is ok to work.
