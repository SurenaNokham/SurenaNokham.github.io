"Hard work, Good PAY","You work for your pay at Walmart, but the starting pay is much better than most anywhere else. Management for the most part is decent, but the drama there is the same as any where else you go. Walmart has a bad reputation, but I feel it is unjust. They are more than willing to work with you. Need extra hours? Done! Need time off? Done! Need to promote? Done!_x000D__x000D_Out of everything, I think the customers are the hardest part of working at Walmart.People  think that just because you are here you must be dumb or not worth the time not realizing you have another job where you are a manager or supervisor, that you are a professional who is working two jobs to make ends meet.  They treat you horribly and laugh as they do it. _x000D__x000D_Walmart is not a bad place to work and the starting pay is worth the time to try.",5,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Walker, MI",6/26/16,2016,6,26

Lewis Center Wal-Mart,"I first started working for Wal-Mart in July of 2011. At that time new hires still had ninety day evaluations.

WalMart is not a company that I plan on working for a long time!,"The management is horrible. There is three managers who I have respect for, the rest do not. I have seen a lot of unethical things happen. Like favoritism, selling items under the table to associates, and etc. The hardest part of the job is just dreading to be there because of management and the associates you work with.

I deserve better.",2,Current Employee,Photo Lab Associate ,"High Point, NC 27265",6/25/16,2016,6,25

Members of management, teams, and staff all work together to make the employees feel that their work is valued at the end of day. A typical day at work always included me leading my team through the night is completing the set of work handed to us. I was great at delegating tasks, organizing, and helping to keep my team members on task; assisting when needed.

Very Proactive work environment with lots of support and challenges,"My Experience as a cashier taught me that most jobs are not specified. Working at Walmart brought me experience with more than just cashiering. Many positions and departments needed assistance during breaks and lunches that were not part of my job occupation. Such as Customer Service, Sales Associate, Electronic department, Truck Unloader etc. My coworkers were very friendly and upbeat toward the work they were doing, they never brought a dull feeling to the day. Managers and supervisors were always on hand whenever the associates needed them. During my stay I've encountered hard and enjoyable parts of my job. The hardest part is the lack of coordination and communications between Management and Supervisors. The effect of that caused the associates to lose breaks and lunches consistently.

Walmart cashier/service desk. Unfair pay.,"I was a cashier at Walmart. My typical day of work would consist of checking out customers, greeting them and solving customers problems at the service desk.Training for the job was easy and well taught. Coworkers are friendly and very helpful. The hardest part of the job is the constant movement, twisting and dealing with rude customers. A typical workday was arriving at my station and signing on to the register. My first customer would arrive which I greeted. I continue to repeat this process until my first break. I would come back from break and repeat the same process over again. The job is so repetitive and gets old fast. The pay is unfair. I started as a cashier and THEY asked me to help out at the service desk. So I worked service desk and cashiering but only got paid for cashiering. I asked to get promoted but they wouldn't allow it because of my coachings. BUT i got the coachings AFTER I had already been working the desk as well.

"Enjoyed working here, did not like the management","Work was pretty simple, but there was always a shortage of employees to work. Lots of work was left for other shifts because management would not schedule people to help. This ended up causing fights between first and second shift more often than not, lots of complaining and many call-outs. Also caused bickering between department managers; when you only have one person available to help a manager and you have to decide where to send them between five areas that need help, you can't make everyone happy. When you have a truck coming in 5-6 days a week you need someone to work that truck. _x000D_My favorite part about the job was getting to work on my own. I knew what to do and did not need supervision, leaving me free reign to get my work done and set my tasks and manage my time. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, most of them were pretty pleasant. I enjoyed supervising, being able to assign tasks and knowing that they will get done. _x000D_Management would listen to concerns and complaints, but did not do anything about them. If there was an issue that was brought to management, most of the time we (my fellow department managers and I) would have to deal with it ourselves. It was often difficult if not impossible to get vacation time approved because of black out dates (Nov 1 to Jan 21, a week before or after holidays, any time you had a major modular coming up). _x000D_I learned a lot on the job. I'm pretty good at merchandising, time management, getting my tasks done on time and efficiently once I know what to do. I learned how to use a Telxon and MC40.

Customer Satisfaction,"The Walmart work day begins with assessing your assigned department and ensuring that merchandise is in stock on the sales floor for customer availability. Walmart has afforded me the opportunity to work with and grow with team members; to value to the customer experience as one's own; and learn the standard operating procedures for the store and other departments. My co-workers take pride in team work and offering insight to daily operations. Walmart's management team would gain competitive edge through welcomed open communication and executing fair practices across the bottom-line. The hardest part of the job is the lack of time allotted to perform teaching moments with associates to demonstrate proper use of tools and resources for assignments, daily procedures, and training and development.

The biggest thing I've  learn working at Walmart is to never judge anyone because you don't know what they are/have been going through. Management are great people who care for the employees that work for them. My co-workers are great hard working people who care about the customers that shop at the store. The hardest part of the job is that when we don't have something they are  looking and we have to tell them we don't carry that product.

Walmart,Walmart is the largest retail corporation in the world. The career possibilities are endless.

"Productive workplace, but lacking in job security.","My overall experience with Wal-Mart was great. I loved all of my positions with the company and I was able to quickly advance myself. I began my career with Wal-Mart as a cashier and eventually transferred to a different location as a CSM. Shortly after that, I was offered an opportunity to join the Asset Protection team as an APA, and that's when my perspective overall began to change. Being an APA, your hands are so tied with policies and it becomes very easy to make a mistake and lose your job. The job was high stress and often involved dangerous situations. I was sadly terminated before I could start my new position as the Front-End Zone Manager. I believe that a lot of the changes happening at a corporate level are effecting the stores in a way that causes a negative environment.

I could probably go on for hours about how the bad outweighs the good here.

I learned that I shouldn't take a job without researching them first they dont care about their workers at all I also got sold a bunch of stock that I will never see the money back for I am glad I was let go of when I did cause they would have continued to take away money for stocks capitalizing on my lack of knowledge in the stock market. The people who work there were down on there luck I have heard that people who work there are collecting Food stamps even though they are working pretty messed up to be put in that situation.  The hardest part of the Job would be how much they demand of a person who works there one of the worst places to work at for the average American worker and overseas I hear they are doing things even worse over there compared to here.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Mount Pocono, PA",6/21/16,2016,6,21

Good Experiences,"Typical day at Wal-mart is quite a stressful or light one, depending on management rotation. Wal-mart usually starts with clocking in, saying hello to your fellow associates, then getting to work. Pulling pallets, Working freight, and unloading the truck. It's mostly routine days with the same objective. Clear the dance floor (Receiving) and prepare to unload the truck. My specific team, Cap 2, does a little of everything in the store. Work Freight, unload the truck, assist customers on the sales floor, and even get on registers to do a little cashiering. We even go outside to push carts when needed. I learned at work is to do what you can. Do your best every second of the day. Especially at my store specifically. Management changed almost completely within a small time frame. About 3 months we lost about four to seven managers and got them replaced within that time. It was....an adjustment. Management before the new managers was good. Laid back, asked us to assist them, and also offered us overtime and such when they was really short handed. An honest way to keep everyone on the clock who wanted to work. When new management hit, everything became...tighter for the lack of a better word. Strict hours, and the work ethics became scattered. Almost like everything fell apart briefly before slowly being built back up. It was quite an experience, though I learned to adapt to the job and keep being positive In the work place, so everyone can stay happy and motivated. My co-workers are the best part of the job. ""Teamwork makes the Dream work"". That was our teams motto, and we stuck - more...",3,Former Employee,Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Torrance, CA",6/21/16,2016,6,21
"Great place to work, and advancement is achievable.","Working at Walmart was both fun and challenging at times. I learned several things while there. For instance I acquired leadership skills, the knowledge to operate a forklift, and other machinery while there. The work environment is great, it is like have a family while at work. Although it was fun it was also tough. Being able to balance so many  things at once can make or break you. Overall though it has been one of the best places I have worked at, and I know if I can always go back if need be.",4,Former Employee,Supervisor ,"Magnolia, AR",6/20/16,2016,6,20
Daily cleaning at Walmart.,"I obtained this job in early 2015 thanks to my father, who worked in grocery. My employers originally told me I would be working in the Garden Center, then the Hardware section, before telling me it was maintenance, which caused a bit of confusion, but easing into the job was not hard. My main job was to do daily sweeps of the entire store floor. This was divided into four sections which would be swept at specific times of the day based on how busy they were. Each section would get swept twice a day, and then whatever the broom collected would be put into a large trash bag. This encapsulated 90% of what I did, but I would also empty all the trash cans around the store daily. My usual hours were 12pm-8pm, with two breaks and one hour for lunch. The experience was hit-or-miss. I was constantly monitored and questioned if I missed a single piece of dirt. The other maintenance workers would often sleep in the break room, yet get onto me if I took an extra minute. Overall they were very rude. They also repeatedly questioned me about every time I used the bathroom. The store was always hot and I was, at the time, somewhat out of shape so I would chafe badly. On the days that they let me do my job, it was fine.",3,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Waco, TX",6/20/16,2016,6,20
Valuable,"This was a very valuable work experience to me. I gained a lot of customer service experience. The job itself was exhausting, but fulfilling. I had really fun co-workers who made work a joy and reasonable, level headed bosses.The hardest part was dealing with the heat, as I was outside all the time, pushing carts, it was very tiring, and hard, and yet easy because I worked independently and as long as my work was caught up, I was left alone.",4,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",6/20/16,2016,6,20

No consequences for bad behavior._x000D__x000D_Several people suggested I could be a manager. I don't doubt that, but the politicking and self-interest is not a motivator. Plus the fact that pay is capped per position and not based on performance, it's not an incentive to me to be given more responsibility but no further assistance, or really all that much of a pay bump. That's how it is anyway, at least at the store in which I worked._x000D__x000D_A typical day for me would be to come in, hunt for the person who had the keys for my department, find them, reset the tills, check for online orders, help customers -- sometimes simultaneously.

Part-Time Overnight Maintenance Associate,"After clocking in, I try to get a janitor cart ready, but supplies are sometimes short or equipment in poor repair. Sometimes, there's poor coordination in who does what tasks. Management care little about people skills and just care about the Walmart store. I would go so far to say that none of the managers are professionally trained. There is some kind of top-down Management pecking order. My supervisor is always stressed from other managers above him about maintenance things. ""Maintenance"" (Janitor) work at Walmart is very hard and really is an all purpose type job. That is, Maintenance is requested to do just about everything every other ""Associate"" requests from getting other items other than their own stock to cleaning up their mess. For the most part, most of the other Associates are great to work with. Walmart has great diversity in it's staffing. Other than that, I would not recommend working for Walmart, unless you're in a management position or you really need a job.

Worst job ever!,"This job was terrible from the start. Hired to work in the deli, ended up as a cart pusher for a month. Finally get to where I was supposed to be working and find out its understaffed (even with a new person being added on), overworked and pressured by management to work harder for less. I get its, its a kitchen-like environment, tempers flare in tight spaces like that, but the Deli department manager was just plain mean. Rude, crude, condescending, arrogant..... I could go on but there is no point. Management above her didn't care. She got her employees to work hard through fear so we always had stuff stocked out of fear of being written up and fired over things not being ""finished"". It didn't matter that 2(two) people were required to stock everything AND manage 3 meat/cheese slicers, a fryer, a rotisserie oven, make DOZENS of sandwiches and do any custom orders for the day(usually only 1 or 2 six foot sub, some days its was 5-10. Holidays could see over 20 being made.) and prep for the afternoon shift. THIS WAS A DAILY TREND. I worked in the Deli for a little under 2 years. My schedule changed monthly, sometimes weekly. Some weeks I worked 35 hours, usually got around 20 (Walmart doesn't like full-time employees, they get benefits), some weeks I got 12 hours. Even though there was work to be done, upper management decided not to have people on more often then not. It was deplorable. The only reason I stayed was because I needed a job.

"Scanning items, customer assistance, enjoyed working",A typical day would start with finding out what register I would be on and then scanning customers items as they proceed to check out. I would collect a form of payment and any other assistance the customer might need. I learned how to be patient and how to count back change. Management was always very helpful whenever a customer needed help. I got along with everyone there. There really wasn't anything hard about it. I enjoyed working there because I would love talking to the customers and seeing them smile as they left the store.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Ocala, FL",6/15/16,2016,6,15
Underwhelming experience,"Working at Wal-Mart was exhausting and unrewarding. The management was not friendly and very unresponsive. There have been many times that I was assigned by a manager to work on a register that did not have a sufficient amount of change, which is extremely frustrating, embarrassing, and unprofessional when a customer requests cash back. It is also very embarrassing when a member of management takes upwards of 15 minutes to bring cash enough change for the register and the customer. Many of the associates loathe their jobs, and it is apparent. It is so hard to locate a floor associates that often customers come to the registers to ask where to find something. The hardest part of the job is the unproductive environment and the lack of consistency in the amount of hours I was assigned to work.",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Dulles, VA",6/15/16,2016,6,15

I never had a customer yell at me and I worked there for 2 years, I did have some annoyed customers, but I treated them with respect and they tended to do the same.  I left the job for a better paying job, but turns out I was happier at Walmart.

Cashier,As a cashier you're basically disposable. Walmart tells you they appreciate you but as soon as they let one go another one is hired. The hardest part of the job isn't even the rude customers.

The work place was fun when I was there working,"I would go in at 6:30am and first thing I would do is count the podium...Then go and count the loansfor the service desk amd the money center..Then I would put everything in there own bank bags and take them to the podium. Then I would brake down the bills and change to what each register needed to start off there day. Then as soon as the cashiers would do a cash transaction then I would go around and do audits on each cashier until I got 10 or 20 audits a day...Then I would run the floor and answer the calls as soon as they would come across the palm pilot. I would make sure the cashiers would get there breaks and lunches or price checks and I would run the front end. Id keep up with the cart pushers, customer service, money center, cash office, self check-outs, and all registers. Make sure the chasiers had there bags and if they had any questions id be there to answer and help, it was a very fast paced job that kept me very busy",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Manager/CSM ,"COPPERAS COVE, TEXAS",6/14/16,2016,6,14

Giving Back,"My job entailed waiting on customers, and helping with any problems. I learned that not everyone can be pleased but you always give it your best shot. Management didn't really seem to know what the cashiers went through all the time, it was nice having to know the people you work with, their quirks.

Review of Walmart,"There is not much to say about being a cashier at walmart when you are 17/18. It's job, but the people are usually friendly, unfortunatley the customers may not be. That is a standard fact of retail though._x000D__x000D_Walmart does deserve a satisfactory rating, much like how you grab a Subway sandwich and are satisfied it wasn't McDonalds. The workplace isn't terrible and you don't feel constricted by unnecessarily strict rules. There are some bad management decision such as how grocery is stacked and stored. They do have their good moments when they take the time to hear out employee concerns too._x000D__x000D_Walmart is not a terrible place, nor is it heaven for jobs, but it's without a doubt better than most.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Dublin, VA",6/13/16,2016,6,13

Ok Job,"Walmart is not a very organized company. Walmart do not care about employees. They just care if you come to work. You can be dying or on your last breathe and they do not care as long as you clock in. I know first hand because I was sick and I was having chest pains and I told a member of management and the first thing she said was "" Do you know the about the attendance policy"".. I was so in shock because WALMART says they are family oriented and they care but they do not. The company do not have great benefits. The benefits they do have you have to work there ten years before they even apply to you. Walmart tell you about the ten-foot rule when you work for them and one of those rules are to speak, greet and smile  at your customers but they are mean and hateful and they don't even do all of that to the employees.

Diverse workplace with great opportunities for personal relationships,"A typical day at work would start out by immediately cleaning up after a previous shift's work day. That would include janitorial duties, completing breaks, managing schedules, helping customers, informing management of duties, and assigning work to fellow co-workers. After this is completed you are required to help the customers at the service desk by providing Moneygram financial services, completing returns, taking verbal complaints, helping cashiers with questions, responding to managements requests, informing cashiers of breaks, answering the phone, helping customers both at the service desk and on the floor, and making sure that your area is completely clean. All while remaining calm under pressure with a smile on your face. Maintaining some semblance of well-being on this job is the hardest part because as a Customer Service Representative and sometimes supervisor its hard to keep a content smile on your face. But the most enjoyable part has to be completing a task to everyone's satisfaction. Also managing to help the customer and your co-workers throughout the day.

Firing people based on points, bad management, and co-workers not doing what they are supposed to do. It is really easy to learn, the customers are nice and patient if you let them know you are still learning. I learned how to count money faster, speak to customers appropriately, and stock. The management was okay. The thing that really got under my skin was when the lines were long, they would just tell us to work faster, and they would sit there and watch without helping. The co-workers are great depending on who they are. They love to help you out when you need it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with WIC. The first few times are intimidating, but it got easier. Noted, people get frustrated really quickly with WIC so be calm and have sympathy.

Working over night you have to immediately start doing the trash and hangers up front, which isn't bad if you didn't have a manager telling you to do one thing and two others telling you to do two other things. Management wasn't bad. They were nice people just didn't communicate well. I loved my co-workers, they were nice and accepting of things.

Cashier,I love Walmart the CSM's are very helpful and work very hard to assist the cashiers as fast as they can. We get 15 min breaks at least every 2 hours. Hour lunch break. Hardest part is when you are working a 5 hr shift and only get one break and sometimes lifting up the cases of water and soda and do a job on your back but that's the job. co-workers are great always willing to help each other in any way they can.

Its interesting...,"A normal day ash a cashier, you think it would be easy, but not at Walmart. You are constantly dealing with managers expecting you to do the work of 5 other cashiers, while pushing credit cards and handling unruly customers, piled on to making sure no one in your line or self-check is stealing. Its a lot to handle. Some days not even your higher ups know whats going on with the front end, it can be mass chaos, but most days I do enjoy my job. The other associates are a joy to work with, and there are days where you meet the customers that make working there just so much better. If you do work for them, don't expect bonuses for about 9 months, and don't expect any type of benefit for about a year.",4,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Hickory, NC",6/8/16,2016,6,8

Wonderful people but don't expect fair treatment.,"I have worked for Walmart for 4 years now. I will start by saying that it really is NOT a bad place to work at all. I am proud to say I got a job at Walmart out of high school. But through the years I have noticed that moving up is really difficult.Don't get me wrong moving up isn't something that should be easy, but they don't even interview for higher up positions half of the time. The managers all get together and decide which associate who applied for the position should get it without giving everyone the change to show if they are manager material. You can work your way up the hourly food chain like I did but once you hit that wall you are stuck there unless your name gets pulled out of their hat.",4,Current Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Quincy, WV",6/8/16,2016,6,8

"Rough company, but my store had a good crew.","THe company overall isn't as bad as it's reputation--but it quite nearly is. Advancement is tooth and nail, intentionally so, even though there are an excess of opportunities for promotions. Raises were recently set at a fixed rate that is lower than it used to be. Few of the workers are given full time, even after a decade of employment. Hours are randomized by a computer--the same computer that will fire you, by the way. FOr example, if you have more than nine ""points"" of absences in a rolling six month period, you're fired by the computer. Even if those points are due to management filing things incorrectly. Like not applying sick or vacation time to your absences, or even if you hit ""clock out"" on the time clock instead of ""going to lunch""._x000D__x000D_Despite that, I did respect my crew and most of my management were helpful and empathetic.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Wood Village, OR",6/8/16,2016,6,8

Customer Service and Stocking,Management is always confused. So much gossip its like being back in high school. Almost set up to fail in a few situations. Such as Dept mgr wants me to do a project in the department then a Ast mgr comes and wants you do to something else pulling you off first project. You have to drop what the department manager wants then do what the Assistant manager wants.

Most of my co-workers were very nice and worked together as a team. The management team are micro-managers which demonstrates that they do not have any confidence in the cashiers and their abilities to act independently while working.

Management would typically ask for me to handle more complex tasks and to teach others what should be done. My co-workers came with a variety of work ethics, so I learned how to optimize each of their skill sets in order to help build the team up. The hardest part of the job was picking up the slack of others, as it was expected that the team finish their work before heading home but typically was not the result.

Hated this place,"The managers at this location play favorites. Their favorites can get away with practically murder when it comes to doing their jobs or doing things against protocols and policy. If you are not a favorite they treat you like dirt. If you work hard you have to make up for the slack of the rest of the team because they  get away with slacking, but if you do they write you up or give you verbal warnings etc. This place also doesn't care about medical accommodations, I had some approved and any time I tried to use them I was told if I couldn't do anything more than I was doing then I needed to just go home. I was only treated well when I was accomplishing working multiple people's job. This place expects you to pull of a 4-8+ person job by yourself. The assistant managers love to sit on their butts and be scarce, only time it is different is when the store manager is on premises and keeping them jumping. I wouldn't work at this location again if it was the last place to work on earth. Oh and you were told you had to take your breaks, but if you did and you weren't able to get all your stuff done because the work load, customers &/or physical/medical restrictions you were told you had to stay late and if you didn't you got a write up.",2,Former Employee,Fitting Room Associate ,"Bogalusa, LA",6/4/16,2016,6,4

Souls are cheaper at Walmart,"This job will suck the life out of you, no matter how good of a worker you are or how positive you try to be.

"Great Community, Terrible Management","Overall not a terrible place to work but specifically at my store the Management was terrible, didn't listen, and one of the more Sadistic Co-Managers literally gets a thrill out of firing employees and thanks to my falling Ill I became a victim of this too, but the management was vindictive and never believed for once that the employee could have good ideas and never gave me a chance to defend myself. It turns out that I was Hypoglycemic and Work was actually killing me. But when I would slow down on the job and suffer they would be right there whipping me and lecturing me. Rumors run rampant in such a large environment which I believe ultimately led to my downfall. It was when rumor that I did not do any of my actually work and was just lazy spread that I noticed Management so far down my back and knew I was being discriminately judged. Unfortunately I can't say that was the only spreading rumor, I heard gossip everyday and about everyone.

Ive learner so much working customer service  but one of the most important things ive learned is to let the customer know you are concerned and your there to help. Even though co-workers and management are usually not on the same page I have to stay focused and do my part.

Okay place to work,"On a typical night at Walmart you'll gather ""L"" carts as you down stack merchandise and separate it by isle. For example, ice cream, frozen waffles, garlic bread goes on one cart, frozen dinners, fries, and vegetables on a different cart. Once the freight has been separated you and your team work freight to the shelves. Overstock is prepped or tagged then placed in bins located in the freezer. The bins have a location tag and using a scanner you place the overstock item to that bin location. After the freight is all worked, you return to the department and begin zoning, or straightening up merchandise on the shelf making it neat and presentable. Some coworkers are wonderful to work with while others are lazy and unreliable. The hardest part of the job is withstanding the cold, and organizing the department because some will ""plug"" items where they don't belong making it that more difficult to finish the job at times.",3,Current Employee,Frozen/Dairy-Meats associate ,"Sterling Heights, MI",6/3/16,2016,6,3

Wally World,Working at Walmart has its perks but a lot of down falls. The entire store from salaried managers to associates is like a high school. everyone is in everyone's business. Management sucks ! They only look out for themselves. you as an associate is priority zero. They expect you alone to move mountains in minutes like your some kind of magician. Every associate is P/T because they don't want to give more than 32 hours. if you've been there long enough and fought to be full time you cant pass 40 hours per week. If you go over time before your pay period ends you have to cut it by taking a double lunch.,3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Miami, FL",6/2/16,2016,6,2

"A steady job with great benefits, but not glamorous.","Working in retail is exactly what it seems like.  There is a lot of compromising with customers and coworkers, and many tasks to be done on a daily basis.  Upon clocking in I am fair game to be pulled to any area, especially as I can use a register very well, and am knowledgeable in all areas of the store.  Management generally works towards a common goal, but it is not uncommon for communication between them to be faulty or misconstrued.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the general lack of communication between management, middle management, and regular associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the experiences you gain working with different types of people and the interactions with different customers with greatly varying standpoints.  The benefits are not bad at all.  Wal-Mart offers a 401k, stock, and insurance.  The insurance is not terrible.  They also start new workers ABOVE minimum wage.",4,Current Employee,Lawn and Garden Associate ,"Bloomington, IL",6/1/16,2016,6,1

this is me only speaking about store 02255 nowhere else,management fails to communicate properly with one another. Come shift change everyone is lost. Advancing or transferring positions here is only possible if your a close friend or relative to management. Backroom associates are treated poorly and are blamed for all things wrong in the store.

"Easy to Move Up but, Won't Provide Benefits nor Hours","I worked as a cashier and then got promoted to a Customer Service Manager within 3 months of working there. I practically worked 35 hours a week and the work load was too great for the small amount of employees there so the work that was done for the amount we were making was not worth it. The management tried their best, but still sucked at doing their job. Since Walmart is a corporation, they really weren't given the tools and resources to make work easier. The coworkers were okay but too many teenagers worked there which made the work environment too lax. A lot of them did not take their job seriously and were lazy.

Job security with conditions,"I've worked with Wal-Mart for 16 years. As long as you do what your told and don't try to go too far above and beyond you may be able to advance if you know the right people. Fantastic vision coverage for insurance if you work full time. Overtime is treated as insubordination. If you have even a minute of overtime they have you cut it by taking a long lunch or clocking in later on next day of business. The sick policy is disgusting. You could have a presidential pardon for the day you were out and it would STILL be considered unexcused. The management temperament varies from person to person and you often find people being treated differently if their manager doesn't like them. The hardest part was finding the balance between ingenuity, voicing ideas that may make a project better and keeping to what your manager likes. Favoritism is high. My coworkers were almost always fantastic people who were a joy to work with. I loved having the opportunity to help people. Helping people get what they need to improve their lives gives me the warmest feeling in my heart.

Worst company to work for.,"I don't say that title lightly. This place sucked. When management wasn't getting onto you to work faster when you were already working your hardest. They were pulling you from your job, to do another job because there wasn't enough help.

I was an overnight stocker, and slipped on a wet mat that was not properly cleaned up and was not properly signed. I injured my knee, and could not work. They took this as an opportunity to have me do my computer training a year into my employment. Mind you, this is the training you are suppose to do to be able to work there. Things that certify you, to do certain tasks. They also wanted me to stock the electronics department in a riding cart. When I had to wear a non movable knee stabalizing brace._x000D__x000D_When I would tell them I couldn't do it, it was that or be fired basically. I opted to take the latter, and not work for the crooked company anymore. No overtime, they would make you cut 1 minute of overtime. If you had to stay over, say 30 minutes. Instead of an hour lunch, you took an hour and a half lunch. Then get yelled at when the work isn't done in time.

Management,"As a customer service manager I work closely with all the associates in the store and have found a few common factors. The biggest one is that there is no communication between our management team. They all think that their part of the store is the most important part and need it to be a priority. The second is there is a lack of hiring and retention. The turn over ratio is sitting at about 65-70%. It's gotten to the point that management is driving people away and they aren't seeing how. They are to hard on their associates and while some can take it such as the supports and certain supervisors most can't and leave without a notice or just decide to not come in to work. The third biggest complaint is the lack of promoting the proper people. The people that get promotions now are those that can suck up the most, not the ones that deserve it. _x000D__x000D_Hardest part of the job is knowing exactly what management and market want since most of the time it doesn't add up. _x000D__x000D_Most enjoyable part of the day/job are the coworkers that you become so close to.

I really enjoyed working for walmart,"I was a cashier but transferred to customer service, I enjoyed working there but i didn't like that the managers had their favorites and the rest of the employees had to pick up the slack of the ones that didn't want to work.

From fellow associates to returning customers, its gives you a sense of community. I like to think of Walmart as a second chance company. No matter what hardships you've had in life, they will take you in.

While I was there learned team building and how to work under a lot of stress.  _x000D_While working at Walmart built a relationship with my co-workers which kept us motivated to work as a team to finish our jobs on a timely manner.

I learned that i have to be patient when helping customers at cash register because so customers are in-patient when waiting on line.My boss treats his workers equally by giving them respect.

The most enjoyable day at a work place for me is when i can help customers in the store have a good experience when they are here.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Naples, FL",5/24/16,2016,5,24

Burnout,"I worked as both a cashier and CAP 2, which involves unloading the truck, sorting products by department and then taking them to their respective departments and stocking. _x000D__x000D_CAP is a really physical job. In any given day you'll walk miles around that store. Unloading the truck is really fast-paced and physically demanding as youre lifting huge and heavy boxes pretty regularly. Unlike third shift stockers though, you aren't going to have an empty store while you're putting products on shelves. You have to work around customers, grab items from the back and show customers where products can be found. It's actually pretty frustrating because a common thread among Walmarts is their high turnover rate. CAP members are sent to stock shelves anywhere from 5 to 7pm aka right when everyone gets off work. This way Walmart can hire fewer sales associates because they expect CAP to just do both jobs. This leads to another common thread: burnout. There are always too few employees and too high of expectations at Walmart and they end up burning their employees out. _x000D__x000D_Training depends on the store you get, so some new employees are just thrown out on the floor with no knowledge and too much required of them. Customers also get frustrated because nobody working there has the answers to their questions. Stockers are expected to stock the shelves in a certain amount of time. If you work at Walmart you'll hear the term ""only ___ hours of work"" a lot. That is the amount of time some magical elf with perfect knowledge of where all the products go managed to stock the shelves of an empty Walmart. - more...",2,Current Employee,Cashier/Stocker ,Wisconsin,5/24/16,2016,5,24

Inappropriate Behavior,Very disrespectful managers and inappropriate behavior towards me on the job.

very strict plce to work.,"At this job they expected the most out of their employees. my usual schedule was either 5pm to 10pm or 8am to 5pm. There are many different mangers that work at Walmart, they all have different responsibilities and sometimes they can over direct you by telling you to do one assignment then another manger telling you differently, I would say that was the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part about this job was getting to know different people.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Borger, TX",5/24/16,2016,5,24

working with walmart,"I am currently an employee at Walmart in Wilmington NC.

Awful Environment with Even Worse Management,Walmart is the kind of large juggernaut of company you would expect it to be. Uncaring and negligible with a cheery and politically correct facade. Their benefits are admittedly impressive. But at the cost of your psychological sanity. The managers are pressured to produce more and more profit by the second which leads them to pressure you to accomplish more and more ridiculous and inhuman feats to get through the work day. It doesn't help that this environment churns out more and more angry and unhappy workers that show a bad light on the company itself. There is a very good reason Walmart is losing BILLIONS in profits and it has to do with the very publicly known poor way they treat their employees.,1,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Edmond, OK",5/23/16,2016,5,23
About what you would expect,"Easy to go above and beyond expectations, as they set the bar pretty low. Easy to get promotions if you want them, especially to low-level management.

Productive,I enjoyed my time at the TLE for Walmart. My days were pretty smooth without any major types problems. i learned how to get things done in a orderly fashion.

My Review,"When I used to work at Walmart I had good experience with walmart. I'm going to write about the typical day, what I learned, the management, my co-workers, the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job. _x000D_  The typical day at Walmart was stocking and dealing with people. I had to stock, help the customers to find what they're looking for and give them all my attention so I could help them. What I learned was fast pacing and multi-tasking. The management was great. If I need something or just need help they would help me. If I need a day off, they world let me. The management was overall really good. My co-workers on the other were funny, smart and easy to get along with. _x000D_  My last two opinions are the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job. I'm going to start with the hardest part of the job. The hardest part of the job was when people came up to me and started to talk Spanish. Personally I don't know Spanish and I would try to help them or find someone that could translate for me. _x000D_My last opinion is the most enjoyable part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got to know/talk with great customers, majority at Walmart I made new friends.",4,Former Employee,Produce Stocker/ Sale associate ,"San Antonio, TX",5/23/16,2016,5,23

Good place to work,all in all Walmart is a good place to work. Management is fair for the most part. I enjoy working with my co-workers.

It's a hard job with few rewards and few consequences.,"This was my first job and I found that it was super understanding about that, as long as you are there on time, try your best, and follow general company policies, you'll be fine. The problem is that Walmart is changing for the worse. There are two kinds of employees there now: Those that are stuck because either it's all they know or they've been there so long the benefits are too good. And those that can't get a job anywhere else. Great for gaining experience, but there are people there who don't care. Who hate the work, and pile it on to people who do get it done. The managers pressure the people they know will care, so good people get extra work and pressure while the slackers get excuses made for them.",3,Current Employee,night shift Cashier / stocker ,"Ormond Beach, FL",5/23/16,2016,5,23

It was full-time at least,"Work/Life Balance:  I got 40 hours a week which was nice, but I worked overnight so that is expected. Good luck getting a night off though. The managers don't take kindly to that and you will be reprimanded. 1/5_x000D__x000D_Compensation: 1 dollar extra for working over night, and a 40 cent raise after one year. Better than nothing, but is it worth it? Maybe if you're just a teen looking for extra cash, but if you have an actual life, no, not really. If your store makes good enough sales and you've worked there long enough, you can expect a helpful quarterly bonus as much as $300. 2/5_x000D__x000D_Security/Advancement: Don't expect to go anywhere here. You can bust your butt and not get anything for it. Despite being thanked for my work many times, and being told I was an indispensable member of my team, I was never promoted, offered any other positions, and the only raise I got was 40 cents after one year. 1/5_x000D__x000D_Management: It's about what you would expect. Some managers do genuinely care about their store and employees and are nice, but most don't really care about you, and will write you up for the simplest mistakes. Many Walmart managers perpetuate a culture of fear to keep their inferiors in line. There is also anti-union propoganda playing on TVs in the break rooms. 2/5_x000D__x000D_Culture: Like I said, anti-union propoganda. There are meetings before your shift starts where employees are degraded by supervisors in front of everyone. The managers will tell you to do one thing one night, then find out that was a mistake, and reprimand you for doing the thing they told you to do the next night.

Great company with advancement opportunities,Walmart as been a great company to work for. There are plenty of advancement opportunities and good benefits.

They do have a good stock buying program where they contribute 15 % of what you purchase.,4,Current Employee,Personnel Coordinator ,"El Paso, TX",5/19/16,2016,5,19
A fun workplace but can be a bit challenging when the time comes,"Working at Walmart was a fresh experience since it has been my first job. Any task could be done easily, such as stocking shelves, heavy lifting or just cleaning the work space. Management is friendly and will lend a hand and ear to any associate's problem even when it's very busy. I enjoyed meeting new associates and customers and came and went. It gets really hard during the holidays when customers disregard shelf organization and leave items all over the place. Walmart was a great first experience, but in truth it put me in a lot of stress since I was put in night shift most of my hours, and I would work alone, putting a lot of pressure on me to organize and deal customers by myself. It really put off ""working as a team"" out of its place. My hours put me in weekends a lot, and also working from the afternoon to midnight, which puts me in a position where I couldn't hang out with friends anymore unless it was day off or really late at night, even if I did, I would be tired and wouldn't be having much fun. I put a lot into working at Walmart at first but it started to become demotivating, knowing I get all this pay but no one to really spend it with. Balancing a social life was hard, even more so when the college semester started.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Elk Grove, CA",5/19/16,2016,5,19
Fun and busy workplace,"Working for Walmart I definitely learned alot. I learned how to really in depth keep track of inventory and how to place orders for more merchandise.

Not Good,"I hated Walmart. They treated me so unfair from the rest of the workers. A typical day at Walmart was the managers catching attitudes with the workers, and customers. Managers was so unprofessional. They wouldn't give people their well deserve vacation but managers made sure they went on their vacation. They would give hours. The store manager was so rude to workers. They fired me because I still signed on my register by an accident. They wouldn't give workers their lunches on time. An not enough workers at night that why lines would be long.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Lafayette, LA",5/18/16,2016,5,18

"Fun, but unorganized and unproffesional",When you need money for your till or a customer wants to speal wioth the manager it takes at least 10 minutes to even get ahold of a managwer and even longer for the manager to come over and solve the problem.

A good enviornment for advancement,"I work a constant but fast pace during my shift, I learned where everything goes in the store just about which makes my job easier at times. I feel in my own personal opinion with the policies they have set in place at Walmart,  it allows a few selection of managers to have leeway to talk to rude to their employees at times and be unappreciative of how hard the task that u are assigned to do is. I do not agree with the my guide system or the attendance policy. I work with a lot of hard working individuals who take there job seriously but also take the time to get to know other employees to make the working environment a little less intense. The hardest part of working for this company is the my guide system which gives the managers an estimated time limit on how long it should take an employee to complete a task verses what you are actually capable to do with how much freight your given to work. the most employable part of this company in my opinion is, Its a job u can make a career out of and it looks good on your resume as far as finding better employment.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"South Euclid, OH",5/18/16,2016,5,18

I was fortunate to see WalMart at one of the better parts of its time.,"Fortunately I was able to work while some of the greater good was for the employees.  Sam Walton built a strong company that worked with employees in order to pay them well and let them enjoy the careers they were able to earn through hard work. His belief that everyone wants to work someplace where they feel needed and their efforts were rewarded worked better for the company.  I watched after his wife passed away the small snowball at the top of the hill start rolling down hill as it got bigger it rolled faster.  As more corporate decisions were made on profit rather than what the company was built on which was the loyal employees.  The same employees, as they felt less appreciated they have stepped down taking on less demanding jobs or even walked out due to the corporate decisions to get 1/2 the people to do twice the work.  Working along with personnel associates I got to see first hand where people were hired for positions they were not qualified for only because there wasn't anyone that was qualified that would apply for them.  Careers become Jobs and loyalty was punished.  Anyone looking for a job WalMart is the place to be, I personally would like a career, where hard work is appreciated not stepped on.",4,Former Employee,"Cstmr Srvc Mngr, Safety Team Leader, Photo Tech ","Boiling Springs, SC",5/17/16,2016,5,17

Customers would be upset because of the long lines and lack of customer service. Management would get us in trouble because they would still expect no mistakes with all the pressure and no back up. I learned to work in different departments so that I can gain more hours Instead I got more work for the same time and pay! they moved me to nights three times and got upset because I asked them for the 50 c that is required by California that they tried to avoid by changing my job description.

Typically I can expect a welcoming morning meeting with all associates involved and interacting with one another. The Co-workers are as engaged as the management team and makes everyone feel like they have a sense of ownership in what they do. The Hardest part of this job is the consistency in shift turnover and in working as a full-store team, rather than the three shifts competing against one another.

Customer-Service based work,"As a customer service manager, I run around like a chicken with its head cut off. It is extremely stressful, but I highly enjoy interacting with customers on a daily basis. Typically, every day entails something different. At this moment, our store is going through many changes so management has a hard time telling us what needs to be done. They all tell us differently. There is a large amount of tension and unnecessary drama on the front end between a few of my co-workers and it brings the environment down. However, the work itself is enjoyable. I enjoy my co-workers' presences, and I love when customers leave with a smile. I also love being a leader for all of the cashiers.",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Bentonville, AR",5/14/16,2016,5,14

Stressful Working Environment,It was a great learning experience about how to deal with people that have different expectations.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with management because they rarely complemented you on your performance. It seemed that there was little you could do to please them.  It was rarely boring on a typical day since there was always something to do and the teamwork provided by the co-workers was helpful.  The easiest part of the job was dealing with the customers who were mostly positive and made the job enjoyable. It's a good job to gain experience in retail.  In face a few employees got the chance to move up the corporate ladder.

Fun and Stressful,"Walmart is a great company with great benefits, bonuses, plus they are linked to Sams. You get a Sams platinum card for less than $6.00 a month! Walmart is slack on the pay rate. I always say you get what you pay for. Walmart's back room positions are just like working in a warehouse. I believe the only associates who really have it easy in walmart are the cashiers, but they manage to make more than the backroom associates. Go figure. My biggest problem with walmart was the lack of communication, which is very frustrating in a big company. A plus is that you get to meet a lot of people from every where, so if you are not a people person I do NOT recommend this job for you. Do not steal period. Make sure that you are on time, especially on your paid breaks. If not you will be noted as stealing time and you will never get a job at any walmart or Sams. I know this bc I was a manager there.

I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart Distribution. The environment was very family oriented.,"A typical day was very busy and fast pace. You had to load, unload, palletize, separate freight, and meet your production goals. Management was different in every area. Every area had a supervisor and each supervisor was different.

Place orders, receive trucks, reconcile inventory control reports, as well as stock and straighten my areas. During that time I would get my new mods that needed to be printed and prepare to set them. I learned a lot at Walmart about managing in a retail environment.

The employees I worked with were a lot of fun and enjoyable to be around.

Not a bad place to work at all,"I worked at Walmart for only one summer because they were remodeling the store. I worked 3rd shift so 10pm to 7am Sunday through Thursday. The typical day was unloading trucks then stocking shelves. Walmart had multiple breaks a day so the shifts would fly by. I indirectly learned the business operations that Walmart uses and could see that their operations were why they were so successful. Management was easy to work with, I didn't interact much with them because I was on my own most of the time, but if i had any trouble with anything they were always right there to help. My co workers were easy to get along with too. I am a very easy person to get along with so making friends with my co workers came naturally easy. The hardest part of the job was just staying awake! I never worked a 3rd shift again so my sleep schedule was crazy at first, but after a few weeks it was easy to cope with. I think what I liked most about the job was my co workers.

Night in the life of a Third Shift stocker at Wal-mart,A typical night at work would start with scanning your badge at a terminal to find what your tasks will be for the night.  You go to that area and prep the carts and pallets of freight that has been semi-sorted for that aisle/area.  After that it is pretty much stocking and helping customers as you go. But you have a small amount of time to finish the task at hand before going to your next task.  Some nights you have 1 task other nights it can be many more depending on how much freight has come in by truck that night.  It is hard work but in my opinion rewarding to finish a task and being able to feel you did a excellent job.  One may think that not many people shop for groceries at 3 a.m. in the morning but they do and helping them is the best part of my job!  The hardest part of the job I would say is not being able to help a customer find a product they need.,3,Former Employee,3 rd shift stocker ,"Madison, AL",5/9/16,2016,5,9
Under appreciated workers,A typical day at work would be cleaning up what was left behind by the shift that worked before me before I can start my task and still was expected to finish our tasks even if understaffed. Management didn't understand the time it took to gather needed tools to complete tasks and it sometimes effected either quality/quanity of work. Some co-workers were hard workers but felt not appreciated while the workers who did just enough to get by everyday seemed to get rewarded. Hardest part of the job was having to sometimes unload trucks and unload stock when the unloaders didn't get it done. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the job done having your department looking nice towards the end of the shift.,2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Stuart, FL",5/9/16,2016,5,9

Walmart was a great learning experience. Joining the franchise has prepared me to conquer anything in life.,"Within the Walmart family our days were always busy and full of excitement, we were guaranteed to face a new challenge everyday. Training is very extensive we are trained to be family, when one person isn't present or need help we come together and get the job done.

A Day in the Walmart Life,"I personally learned a lot with this company. Ive learned structure and determination. A typical work day was always good for me, I was bubbly happy always talking to customers, the customers love me. My coworkers were like family we went to eachother for everything if we needed help from someone in a different department they came over and helped no questions asked. The hardest part of the job was communication, the managers werent very good at that. You would hear something from one manager and the next one would try and tell you something completely different. The most enjoyable part was everyone had eachothers back. We had fun while working and thats the most important part.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Woodland, CA",5/9/16,2016,5,9
Walmart Review,"Standard cashier job, people came in and got checked out when ready. Few people here and there who would argue about a product or benefit, co-workers weren't very happy, not very many smiles, mostly had new co-workers coming in on almost a daily basis. Managers didn't seem to have their routines for employees organized and well placed, most customers would steal and employees sometimes didn't do anything.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Temple, TX",5/9/16,2016,5,9
Nice Place to work for if you dont mind,Walmart is a nice place to work for. Its the rude  customers that make it an unpleasant environment to work in. And the fact that the CSM don't always go a good job with making sure all lines are open and ppl get a break when there supposed to. I can understand once in a while but sometimes when you have 3 CSM and everyone wants to be the big chief and no one wants to be an Indian it can put a lot of stress on the cashiers that are so needed.,4,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Glenmont, NY",5/9/16,2016,5,9

Good job overall..,"A typical day at Walmart is very unorganized, unstable, and frustrating. Most people that come to work are on a 9 hour shift it can be times where you'll get skipped for your 15 minute breaks or even your lunch and you won't get a lunch at all. My co-workers is what made work fun and kept me going. The management was rude sometimes unprofessional and unorganized at times. The hardest part of the job is contacting a manager when something goes wrong with the customer it literally takes management foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to come and by the time they get there the customer is upset and annoyed also the lines in the store can get outrageous because the manager didn't schedule enough cashiers that day so it would be 3 cashiers working with 20 lines closed. luckily  as I've been working there I haven't had a bad or rude customer. some of them understand our frustration. overall great place to work you get a lot of hours a hour lunch and two 15 min breaks.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5/9/16,2016,5,9

This place is definitely not worth the 10% discount,"It's Walmart.  The associates you work with are friendly and the health benenfits are good, but that's where the pleasantries stop.  The management team is a joke.  They lack interest in your feedback and expect you to work miracles every day.  The superstores are extremely understaffed, the pay is pretty low for a company that has been part of the top ten Fortune 500 for decades, the schedules are all over the place, and if you happen to get holiday pay or a bonus, they'll make you take an extra day or two off to balance out your check.  But the main thing about the company that caused me to leave is that they don't back up their workers.  A customer can yell at you, insult you, even put their hands on you but management diffuses the situation by making you look like you're the inferior party in the conflict.  I had to quit.  Walmart isn't a place meant for people who want an actual career or self respect.  I don't recommend anyone to work at Walmart unless you have absolutely no choice.",1,Former Employee,Third shift cashier and former receiving associate ,"Spartanburg, SC 29307",5/9/16,2016,5,9

Management isn't the best or even competent at times.,Managers tend to to talk down to associates as well overwork them by tasking them individually to work freight that is really a job for two or three other people.

Great learning exsperience,A typical day at Walmart is clocking on at 3:00 pm and cleaning the sales floor. Restocking the shelves and making everything look nice and organized. Walmart was my first job and I started when I was 19 years old. It taught me how to talk to people and deal with rude customers. Because the customer is always right. The management was okay. They would tend to tell you to do one thing then have yo leave there to do something else and then make you stay overtime to finish what they stopped you from doing. It wasn't that bad because I made overtime but it was a little frustrating. The hardest part of the job was having to constantly pick up the same thing you just cleaned on the sales floor because people just throw evrythinon the floor.

When I'm done with that department, I would go to my next department and stock that merchandise and zone as I go along, making sure my area was clean and straight. I learned how to unload a truck, stock, and use cash registers. Management was sometimes a little to strict on their employees. They their employees more like factory workers than a team. I made friends with all of my co-workers, to where we would sometimes carpool together. The hardest part of the job, would have to be if you needed to get your days off changed or if you gave them an advance a few weeks ahead of time that you would need time off. The most enjoyable part of my job was making new friends and meeting new people.",4,Former Employee,Stocker/Cashier ,"Fulton, KY",5/3/16,2016,5,3
"Fun, fast paced environment","A typical day at Wal-Mart is exciting because it is a new challenge everyday. Since I work overnight, you don't know what you will walk into from the truck every night, therefore planning is key to my success every night. I learn a lot as far as inventory controls, and managing a large amount of diverse associates. My co-workers are pleasant to work with and we have a good relationship which allows us to communicate well and accomplish company and our set goals. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part of my day, is planning the night, as far as where things should go and having the right people in place, at the right time to get the freight up and the store ready by the time it opens. The most enjoyable part of my job is walking the floor, and helping plan and push out freight since time is limited. I like to push associates in a positive manner for them to reach their highest potential. I even spend time with them sometimes while stocking to get to know them, because my associates make or break me, so having a mutual and respectful relationship is what I aim for.",4,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Bowie, MD",5/3/16,2016,5,3

I like to meet first thing on Monday to discuss our priorities for the week, then meet again in the middle of the week to check progress, and meet once at the end of the week to discuss goal setting for the next week. I meet with smaller groups of my staff during the middle of the week to troubleshoot any issues. For example, during a recent mid-week meeting, I noticed one team was a few days behind on a long-term project. I met with the team and, together, we came up with a strategy for increasing efficiency among the team. Along with constant interaction with my team, I also attend a weekly board meeting where I present my department’s progress to the executive board. On Fridays, once all these tasks are completed, I make sure I have completed all necessary communication for the week via email and in person, and create a list of priorities for next week.",5,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Wilmington, NC",5/3/16,2016,5,3

From this job I have learned many of the essential skills for sales especially in regard to servicing several customers at once. The management team was fantastic I had no issues whatsoever with the managers who were all equally supportive and knowledgeable regarding their duties. My coworkers and I worked together well and efficiently which was actually surprising due to the large number of employees. Perhaps the most difficult part of the job would be attempting to sell several bikes at once during a period of high customer volume while also performing great customer service to all of those in need.

Company offers quick advancement opportunities,"WalMart, as a whole, is not a bad company to work for. It is a place geared for people pleasing, and fast paced. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are rude to you for no apparent reason, other than they are having a bad day, and you are the one they decide to take it out on. However, with the plethera of customers in and out in any given day, the variety of experiences in your shift can be amusing and enjoyable most of the time. The company pays fairly well, given that most people doing a cashier's position are paid much less, and the appropriate break time is almost always allotted for every employee as per in accordance with their work schedule. Overall, as with any company, it has it's good and bad aspects, but it is what one makes it to be.

Faults,"I worked for walmart for almost 7 years doing different things in different stores.  Company values do not transfer very well from store to store.  In one store, we strove to give the customers as best service as possible. In another, everyone is just there to get paid.  Walmart is a huge company and it is almost impossible to make sure than every single person is on the same page.  Some times, the store will be in such desperate need for employees that those who do nothing and should not be working there, get to keep on doing the little bit that they do because it's better than not having someone there at all.  Management can be impossible sometimes.  I was at operational manager level for a while and stepped down because they did not like my sense of urgency.  Tasks are usually impossible to finish and meet high standards and are expected to just get done and as long as the final product does not look horrible, then it's fine.  Suppliers can be difficult to work with and sometimes it falls to you to explain to a customer that the product they have their mind set on just isn't there.  The biggest problem might be their P.O.S. system.  It just doesn't seem to work most of the time.  Products can say that they are being shipped, which should take no more than one to two days, but may never show up.  This could be mostly human error on the distribution side thought.  Theft is a huge problem and it is not handled well.",3,Former Employee,Inventory Control Team ,"Cleveland, MS",5/2/16,2016,5,2

No respect, thought or care for any associates.  Stress is unbearable.  Job is threatened daily.  The higher you move up, the worse it is.  Managers dropping like flies with strokes, heart attacks, suicides, etc.  When the management is miserable, this trickles down to the associates.

Ok to work if you are always available,"Wal-mart is a good company in and of itself. I learned so much about economic standings and what to expect in your typical retail setting. They do give employees a discount card that they and their families can use. The most undesirable part of this job however, is the fact managment does not cooperate easily. It is very difficult to get time off or if you call out for any reason, it is counted against you, even if you have a physicians note. So many absences and your gone, no matter how good you are.

It is the perfect job for those who like customer service,"My job is not hard, but not easy. It is somewhere in the middle. it provides the amount of hours and compensation to maintain a healthy life, and management is relatively flexible with availability and shift length. Wal-Mart on the hand, does cut hours very often and does not permit overtime of any kind. Some of the store's policies hinder progress and providing fast and timely service.

There is no balance in life and work, you get random days off and your hours are always different, just trying to find something better with set days off and set hours and a job that pays more.

"monotonous, physically demanding work","Wal-mart has a reputation for being a poor place to work. The work you have to do is physically demanding and the pay is mediocre.

"Good place to work, friendly environment, but slow in a sense.","Working with Walmart was a good experience for me. I enjoyed it when I first started out. The benefits of working with Walmart are outrageous. If you work there for a good amount of time you are eligible for health insurance through the company, and you also get a discounted card, which is much like a debit or credit card but it just holds your discount on it. Those things are very nice to have and to look forward to. Everyone is kind to each other. It's not bad. Just a usual workplace. But as a student in college, this work place just got tougher on me. They work you shifts, which is great. You've got first, second, and third shifts. I find this workplace better for people who've got families, and who are wanting to retire. Being in college and working with Walmart is hard. Shifts are what make it hard. The managers do work with you on hours, but even when you get those hours fixed you're not making enough to make a healthy life style out of it. It's decent. The way I see it, is if you're a student and working here then you've got to pick one or the other. And don't get me wrong I love to work.

Encouraging work environment.,A typical day at work would start when I clocked in for my shift.After I started my shift I would go and task to see where iI was needed for the day. Most of the times I would rotate various registers through  out the day. Some days I would be tasked to other areas like the garden center or to the clothing area. I learned that I have to be quick and productive to best service my customers.I also learned to rely on my instincts so I wouldn't have to bother my supervisors to much. A few times I would have a customer come up with a price match and was told by my supervisor that if I thought it was reasonable i could go ahead and do it as to lighten their stress load.Most of management were willing to compromise with me and looked out for the employees. The hardest part of the job was to get the customers through the line fast. I prefer to interact with my customers which makes my productivity a little bit lower but I gain loyal customers from it who i would see on a daily basis and ask for me constantly.I enjoyed getting to meet new people every day and learn a little bit about there lives.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Silvis, IL",4/22/16,2016,4,22

Okay place to work depending what you work?,"Opportunities are endless if you apply yourself. But then again it's also about who your in good with in management. The higher up you go in positions the more money you THINK your going to make. But the taxes are so high you can't see a difference in the promotion verses your hourly wages AT ALL. Forced to work over time and then forced to cut it, so they get the overtime work to do the job but you can't keep the overtime to get paid for what you did.",1,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Washington, IL",4/22/16,2016,4,22
"Can be very demanding at times, although the job possition allows a decent amount of freedom.",A strong sense of patience and humor is a must for this job as well as task management skills and multitasking. Every day is fairly unpredictable other than cleaning bathrooms and interacting with customers. Some co-workers can be enjoyable while not so much others. The most enjoyable part of the job is the allowance to free roam the store to complete tasks as efficiently as possible. The hardest part of the job is receiving a task and before finishing that one receive several more from separate managers at most times of the day. Communication is key in this position although some co-workers do not participate as often as others.,3,Current Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Peoria, AZ",4/22/16,2016,4,22
Wasn't the Best but Not the Worst,"Walmart was a place that I made a lot of friends. Customers, coworkers and management all liked the way I work. I worked the registers and layaway, primarily. If there were not enough staff to cover certain areas or if someone needed relief I would perform door greeter and stocking duties. Management was fair and I had become close with management. The hardest part of the job was that there would be lots of theft that I could not always detect. But the job itself was not very difficult.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Houston, TX",4/22/16,2016,4,22

Management for the most part is good minus a few bad ones (which tend to get weeded out at some point or another) but with all jobs you have a few bad guys in the mix.

fast pase work enviroment,A typical night at walmart was to start by making sure that the trucks were getting unloaded. then i would figure out my tmat and assign all associates to the designated work area for the night. at 10 pm when all my associates arrived we would have a short meeting to talk about sales and to direct them to where they would work that night. After the meeting I would ensure that the freight was getting to the floor and that the associates were working it. I would then build my features that i had planned out. on Tuesdays I would write my schedules. If there were any coachings that needed to get taken care of I would get another member of management and get those taken care of. also write and take care of annual evals as they were due. after lunch I would ensure that all the backstock was getting to the  backroom so it could be put in its designated place. I learned how to properly merchandise product in order to have a good sell through for the season.

The typical day at Walmart some would say was challenging but also very fun in terms of challenging yourself every shift to get all your frate done.  I learned a lot at Walmart as far as being able to complete deadlines in a timely manner and on time as well as working more as a team rather then alone.  My management was pretty relaxed and chill as long as you did what you were supposed to do as well as finish your frate.

Everybody would work together and pick up slack if needed to ensure that all of us finished our frate for the day!!

"Corporate nightmare, management scrambling to seize control.","What openly promotes itself as a verdant industry of advancement and opportunity quickly reveals itself to be corporate chess on a grand scale. Workers are pushed to the brink by cold and callous management with meager consideration as they stretch the hourly employees across the store to fill in for missing or damaged cogs in the industrial clockwork. The dividing line between the management and the average employee is as vast as the rift between heaven and earth. Two very separate engines push the store to its operating maximum as it pushes mediocre products and service to the masses who, much like management, refuse to recognize the struggle and effort that the average employee puts in. Your hourly employee is frequently the victim of management schemes to avoid taking the fall for an error, however grievous.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Fredericksburg, VA",4/18/16,2016,4,18

A frustrating workplace with lack of personal understanding for indivduals,"To be quick, and blunt for anyone looking for an honest review.  Walmart is just a job, not a career, how some people can work there for as long as they have, I'll never understand.  I've been an associate for the past two years now and everyday gets more and more difficult. There is: never enough staff, very few people are properly trained, no associates want to help anyone, and no one smiles.  On top of that, the benefits aren't great. The ""supposed highest retail pay"" still isn't high enough to be a living wage. And as an associate, you are treated like a cog in a machine. You get a number, very little effort on the part of management goes into understanding who you are and what you need as a human being with different needs and aspirations.  You get an hour for lunch, it hurts more than it helps. it's a ploy to keep you at work for longer than you should be. Honestly, there is very little that is good to say about Walmart.  The only ever upside I've ever experienced is getting a moment to yourself, being able to breathe for a moment without a frustrated customer, co worker, or manager in constant need of assistance.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Frederick, MD",4/17/16,2016,4,17

When I first started, I had different managers, as time went on they kept quitting and firing the managers, by the time I left the management that was there wasn't the best we had. The Co-managers were okay, and knew how to do their jobs, but the assistant managers didn't seem trained properly, and they got stressed out easily when the store got busy.

Flexible scheduling,"If you are unemployed or work in fast food, then this is the job for you. As an IMS crew member/Cap 2 associate you start your day zoning (straightening up product on shelves and rotating stock)  for an hour. Then you report back to receiving to unload the general merchandise truck, here you will work on the line or in the truck. If you are in the truck you will be responsible for unloading the trailer one box at a time, and dodging falling walls of freight. The truck is the worst part of the job (and was a scarring personal nightmare for me). Working on the line is simply sorting the freight as it comes out of the truck. After the truck is unloaded you will be responsible for one of the following processes, processing breakpacks, processing apparel, or unloading grocery truck. Sorting breakpacks is essentially sorting out boxes of single item freight. Processing apparel is where you sort out clothing based on what gender and age group. Unloading grocery truck is when you pull pallets off the grocery truck and sort them by aisle. After those tasks are done you will need to deliver all this freight to their respective departments on the sales floor. The final task of the day is to work all the grocery freight.",1,Current Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Alpena, MI",4/13/16,2016,4,13

Not a good place to work,They only offer part time meaning you get no benefits.  They dont offer very many hours so it really doesn't matter how much you get paid.  They schedule you for 4 hour shifts.  Its hard to take off.  Hours fluctuate so you miss weekends and holidays and since the 10$ pay raise there is no paid holidays anymore.  The open door policy means nothing.   Talking to your manager does not help.  They do not care.  The only job they care about in the store is their own.  I thought wal-mart would be a good job for me and I enjoy the work I do but no I dont not like the company.  I feel cheated.  I have a son and 600$ rent and my checks are 400$ or less and I make 10$ an hour so you do the math.  I have to have a roommate just to get by.  Thats why Im always looking for work.,1,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Columbus, MS",4/11/16,2016,4,11

Always Productive at Walmart,"While working at Walmart you tend to get some of the best days and then some of the worst days. Everyone is shopping there and getting things for the house and even supplies that they need for trips. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, because they feel that the world revolves around them and when that happens you have to give them your undivided attention, and deal with the situation face to face. Management there are a big part of my job, my managers do help me with what I need help with when I need the help. Most of the time I know what I am doing because my part of the job is the easiest, sometimes it can be tricky but in the end it pays out.

Wish they did more training before we got thrown to the wolves,"Early morning's we would sign off what products we received and if we were missing certain products, Then we would grab all the shipment and begin to stock them upon the shelves. Afterwards we would begin to zone aisles looking for a mess or something that was in the wrong place before busy hours to get our department ready for customers. Throughout the day I would greet customers and asked if they needed any assistance. Once I finished helping the customer I would ring them up at the cashier. Then the process would repeat. My first weekend there they needed help up at front end because our cashier's were not available so they decided to send the new associates to help out. Slow days were dreadful because if you didn't look busy, they would send you somewhere else. Busy days can get really crazy since there are only two registers at the electronics. Hardest part of the job so far has been explaining to a customer a product that I have yet to learn about. Other then that I love putting smile's on the customer's faces. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful when they are around. Management, is hard to explain. sometimes I see my Manager and sometimes I can't find them. Haven't worked here long enough to form my own opinion just yet. Worst day was after completing CBL's there was no training and they told us to head to our departments. We had no numbers for the cashiers and both co-workers who had numbers took there one hour lunch break at the same time during busy hours. Debated whether to walk out due to extreme stress for not being able to help customers.",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Mays Landing, NJ",4/10/16,2016,4,10

Not bad for part-time,"Most days I am a cashier so I encounter many types of people and many situations. I ring there items, collect money, bag their items and usually go above my duties to place the bagged items back into the cart for them. Management is friendly but not always understanding. The hardest part for me is the constant schedule changes and not getting enough hours.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Winston-Salem, NC",4/10/16,2016,4,10
Typical workday,Walmart is a great company to work for just like any other job it has it days.

"Hard mental and manual labor, rewarding to serve customers","I had never worked outside of my home previously where I raised three sons and helped raise several grandchildren.  The job was the only one available for a woman of 54 here in Seminole, OK.  A day was filled with customers nonstop.  Two breaks and lunch.  I learned to use my manners and knowledge of diplomacy in dealing with rowdy or rude customers.  Thinking fast and strengthening my arms and legs were additions.  Management were great except for the one CSM who got me fired, but no evidence was shown and I received my unemployment.  Co-workers were fantastic!  We got along great, helped each other when needed, prayed together, ate together and worked hard to please the customers.  Hardest part of the job moving heavy groceries eight hours a day.

Productive workplace,"A typical day at Walmart Electronics department would be rather busy with a lot of customers and many hand to hand tasks that must be completely in a certain time frame. While working on your task a customer approach you and ask for help; while you are helping that customer another customer approach you and ask for help while your already helping the first customer and now you have to help two customer. Two of your co workers are on the only two register in Electronics ringing up two long lines that wrapped around both sides of the counter because all electronics have to be paid for back in electronics. There are only two sets of keys that are working which is the most important thing you need to unlock each merchandise a customer need. Both sets of keys are passed around between 10-12 electronic associate, so if a co worker needs them the have to find the person who has them to help the customer. In electronics we always have t answer the phone to help the customers that are not there. when it gets busy its hard to get to the phone, then managers then comes to electronics complaining about the phone not being answered. While the department managers are in the back binning and getting picks ready to bring the out to the floor so we can restock merchandise while helping customers. Any customer buying big TV's that need help we have to leave the department to do a carry out and help put the TV in the customers car and tips are forbidden.

"The work was great, the people were awful.","During my unfortunately fairly short time working at Walmart, I must say the unprofessionalism of this particular store was outrageous! While orientation videos and tests gave you the basic breakdown of your daily tasks, and they would feed you a basic tutorial on the floor, they also left notes with employees names where customers could see them and would not train beyond the basics and even then would tell you that you are doing it wrong after following exact orders. I found that one of my co-workers even seemed to sabotage my work at every chance they got. A typical day at work would start pulling out boxes on rocket carts, putting out merchandise, pulling back the overstock to have it sorted for later and then moved on to rolling racks with hanging clothes, zoning everything by size, number, color and group type. Then came tiding everything up again, or ""zoning"" in specific areas given on the chart. Your co-workers were not allowed to help you, even with a big task as it was ""frowned-upon"" even though ""teamwork"" was supposedly the big thing for Walmart. I learned to better organize, how to establish great customer service, how to use a multi-line phone and transfer, and how to build my own professionalism due to lack of theirs. Many people quit from this store within the same time-span as I did, and I cannot blame them for doing so in the least bit!",3,Former Employee,Walmart Associate ,"Paragould, AR",4/9/16,2016,4,9

Retail at it's worst,"Walmart is not known for caring for their employees, and my experience was no different. I started as a cashier, and I loved it. I loved seeing people and talking to them and getting to chat while I worked. That part was great. But when I had to use the restroom, or had a problem with a register or a customer, I was SOL; management was spread thin as it was, and they rarely could come help me before ten or fifteen minutes had passed. And if I was especially unlucky, I got saddled with a manager that didn't like me for one reason or another and would be left hanging._x000D_Scheduling was grueling and harsh. The time slots were sporadic and too all over to allow you to pick up other shifts at other jobs, but never gave you enough hours to get benefits. But they will absolutely ask you to stay after hours and do other people's work for them! Especially if you prove to be capable and reliable; expect to pick up the slack for every other lazier employee, and take the blame when things still don't get done._x000D_And then there were rushes. Holidays were the worst, but some weekends were pretty brutal. Don't expect an ounce of humanity during these times; customers will be at their worst and management won't help you if something goes wrong. Just keep your head above the water and try your best to do everything you can.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Loveland, CO",4/8/16,2016,4,8
Pleasant but sometimes challenging,"Working as a cashier at Wal-mart can be pleasant, as interacting with customers can be very fun and interesting.  My customers tend to return to me because they appreciate my kindness, efficiency and willingness to help.  I enjoy making the end of shopping experience quick and stress-free.  The hardest part of the job is that it is physically very demanding.  Co-workers are supportive and easy to work with.  Management is generally supportive as well.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Ellsworth, ME",4/8/16,2016,4,8

Walmart,"Walmart is a great place to work on customer service skills, no matter what position you are in. They may pay better then most minimum wage jobs but the problem is that it's hard to get hours and there are a lot of different managers which can make things difficult because they all want you to do what they want even if they are not technically over your department, which makes it hard to get all of your tasks done on time.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Berea, KY",4/8/16,2016,4,8
My coworkers were the best part of my day.,"In this place, though I dispise it, I must admit that it was a nice place to work.

Not good,Horrible bosses. they had no respect for others. I would say one suggestion and they would yell at me in front of people.

It was a job and it paid bills,"It was ok working there. You just mind your business and try to get as much of  your work done there as possible. You're never truly appreciated for the work you actually do, even when you go above and beyond. They expect so much more from you and you're left completely spent. I liked my co-workers and only some of the managers. Sometimes, they have a way of talking to you that's unprofessional and right in front of other customers and other associates and they don't care. It's really demeaning. I do want to thank the other associates for teaching me what to do at my job, seeing as we were never trained to do our jobs in the first place. Yet you're expected to do your jobs quickly and efficiently. Still, it was a job and it paid the bills.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Receiving Associate/Stocker ,"Troy, NY",4/7/16,2016,4,7

Fast pace environment and heavy workload.,"A typical day at work consisted of, returns, exchanges, money orders, money gram, bill payments, separating returned merchandise according to departments, and register resetting. I learned the importance of patients, organizing, and planning to decrease the stress of the workload. Customer Service Managers were diligent with assisting employees with over crowded lanes, and relieving employees for breaks and lunches. My co-workers worked well together. We assisted each other with customer concerns and educated each other on policy and procedures of the customer service department. The hardest part of the job is when co-workers became unreliable, causing the work load to increase. However, I really enjoyed working with the customer service team to close the department.

good to work your way up in a company,Wal mart is a great company to work for . They are many benefits and opportunities for the employee . Sadly I had a bad experience with management and it wasn't only me that I would complain about management. I believe that managers and supervisors should treat people with respect so the employee will take them seriously and there is not conflict in the work place .  My co-workers will help each other to make our job faster and easier for everyone . The hardest part of the job was having management screaming at my face all the time because I forgot to tell the customer about our survey.

The open door policy does not work. The managers will ignore your schedule availability. If you do not have an open availability you will not be favored for anything like changing departments or a promotion. Do not listen to managers promises they do not keep them. The management pretends to care and listen to your concerns but overall it is about them and store profit. You will hear how good the company is and all the positive changes ahead but do your research. The benefits, insurance, and paid time off are best for full-time or salaried employees. Most are hired part-time so they don't have to give you benefits and insurance. Shift or department leaders forget about breaks and meals so you go late. If they remember they send you too early so by the end of an eight hour shift you work 3 to 4 hours without break. Then they forget to send you home so you're there another 30 minutes before you clock out.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Nacogdoches, TX",4/6/16,2016,4,6

Bakery Department,My typical day at Wal-Mart depended on whether I worked day shift or evening shift.  Either way I assisted with putting product on the floor and keeping the shelves stocked.  During the day I baked and bagged bread; in the evening I prepped bread for the next day.  I learned a lot about the operations of a grocery store and how to handle specialty customer orders.

A day in the life at walmart,"my responsibility within my job title, is to make sure customers needs are satisfied quickly and efficiently. Along with having merchandise outs filled.

Fast-paced and challenging work place with a satisfying customer service experience,This position has been the most fruitful in terms of honing my customer service skill set. A typical day is coming in and servicing each and every customer I see and cook all hot foods we provide for the general public. Management is there to help with any adverse problems we may encounter with equipment and customer alike if we cannot solve it ourselves. The hardest part of the job can be task management. There are so many small things to keep track of that it's easy to be overwhelmed quickly. I pull out fine thanks to my task management skills.

"Productive, Busy,  workplace","Walmart is supposed to be a structured store. My day at work as a Department Manager would consume of scanning my outs, scanning my backroom, price changes, negatives, any mods I have due that current week, and every Monday and Thursday there is a new process called Shelf Availability that takes up almost a whole day, and on Tuesday and Friday department managers are supposed to work their Reports which take quite a while as well. The Good things about Walmart is being able to train and gain more skills, like receiving trucks, vendor receipts, claiming out damaged items, and top stock._x000D_   The Management at Walmart could honestly have been better. There wasn't much communication and there was sometimes poor direction. There was not very many associates to help the department managers in the mornings, which would have made a huge change. The incoming process of receiving new associates was a very long and not much waiting for since most of them wouldn't last a week. Walmart did have a one to ten shift that came in to work, however we would only have them for maybe a couple hours which isn't enough time to complete any given task by the time they were pulled away by an assistant manager to start a new task. Most were not the most motivated, and the overall moral of the associates was very bad. This is also where the hard part of the day comes. Every department manager is told by higher management every morning that any carts, freight, and anything left over from overnight shifts has to be completed before we leave for that day. Our shifts run from 7am -4pm which is not enough - more...",2,Former Employee,GM Department Manager/Support Manager ,"Arlington, TX",3/31/16,2016,3,31

Working at Walmart was OK but not satisfying enough for me.,"The hardest part of the job is not knowing what the day will be like. There was never really any consistency on what we would be doing for the day. There was never really any job structure to what my duties where.

Easily Obtained Job,"I honestly applied for and worked here after high school in order to save money before I started college. I don't really like Walmart in the first place, but it is 10x as worse in a place like Trinidad. If you're not from here, people are likely to treat you like you're scum, which most of my coworkers did (except for a hand full) and most of the customers. Everyone who shopped there seemed to act like they were owed all the attention in the world and more. I must say, it did prepare me for any negtive customer or patient experience I might have in the future. That said, it wasn't all that bad when it came down to being just a job. There were frequent breaks and those few great coworkers and managers that made everything worth. I never comlained about the little things because I never let them get to me, but if you are someone who has that tendancy, then maybe steer clear if you can. It's a stressful customer oriented position where you have to be flexiable.

They do this to try and be the number one store in Alaska. Co-workers were great because everyone got along which made the environment friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with snotty customers who give attitude back when you're just trying to help them with their problems.

Walmart Central Fill is NOT a place for pharmacists who want to practice pharmacy.,"I was hired as a part-time pharmacist (evening shift) at the central fill location in Orlando.  The evening shift was appealing because I also own a business and am very involved in other pharmacy organizations so it allowed me to make an extra buck and avoid huge gaps on my resume.  The low level of stress touted during the interview was also a plus.  This is a closed door environment so you do not have to deal with patients and prescribers.  Unfortunately, low level of stress meant a BORING job and with boredom and idle minds comes pettiness.  The people in this warehouse cause much drama among themselves possibly due to not having enough to do.   These pharmacists are only responsible for verifying prescriptions on a conveyor belt at a rate of about 400 scripts per hour.  The goal of this pharmacy is to eventually not need as many pharmacist verifying.   The job itself is a piece of cake.  Unfortunately, the night shift is run by sects of foreign pharmacists who cannot obtain employment in any other realm of pharmacy practice so they assert themselves by nit picking over seating arrangements and lunch schedules.  If you are an african american or caucasian pharmacist who seeks to be more than a pharmacy technician or other low level position, I would not apply. The night shift caters  to foreign pharmacists who don't know pharmacy and who need a job and a few bucks.  Central fill caters to middle eastern and asian pharmacists who are there because they barely passed the boards and cannot work any place else.

"Busy, often underestimated job, and extraordinarily challenging.","A typical work day begins with a 10pm meeting, followed by gathering the materials needed for the job (pallet jack, trash bags, etc.) Then we typically begin to work freight.

A great way to get in shape.,"I push carts. I clock in, grab a reflective vest, go out to the parking lot, and spend the day attempting to maintain shopper satisfaction. The first thing you learn is as soon as you put on a reflective vest, all consideration for you as a pedestrian will go out the window. Be wary, and never take your eyes off traffic. Cart pushers get hit more frequently than CEOs want the public to know. You also learn time management and  prioritization especially when you're the only one scheduled on a Saturday. Management is either hit or miss, but don't worry, because management changes around every few months, and no matter what, there will be at least one agreeable person in your fleet of managers. All of my coworkers have been friendly, but I've heard stories from the others. The good (and bad) thing is most don't last more than a month or so. Because of this, you wont have to wait long for an opportunity to make a new friend. Dealing with idle-minded drivers, and temperature (depending on where one lives) are the most prevalent cons. It's not so easy as to be boring, yet it's not so challenging that one is without plenty of time to think.

Depending on who you get depends on the training you get. Most of the time they just throw you right in. Management does not communicate well together & tends to have their favorites when it comes to following policy.

They expect you to come to work sick (regardless of what is said other wise) & excuses from doctor's are not excepted. The hardest part of the job are lots of double standards, doing the job of 3 or more, always short handed, covering up for visiting VIP's,being improperly equipped & the every changing schedules (sometimes without your knowledge or consent).

Productive Workplace,Walmart was a productive workplace but how they set the schedule up is to where you spend most of your time if not all of your time working in Walmart.

Not consistent,"A typical day at Wal Mart was to see what time, how many hours, and when meal break was scheduled. These things changed on a weekly basis, and often times daily. The learning experience was an understanding of the ways a major retailer conducts business and uses employees as unsatisfied minions. Management was unaware of what management was doing. From one manager to another, no one in the building knew what the other was doing. Employees would be assigned a task by one manager and another manager would discipline said employee for not listening to them. I was an absolute joke. The co-workers were a group of wonderful individuals. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. Some were rude and others were very pleasant.

Opinion on the Island City Walmart,"The first person to get to work is a coworker of mine that makes the early morning donuts. When my job is to maintain the bread I get to bake the bread, put the bread in bags, and serve the customers while also stocking the floor with new product. When my job is to close the bakery I typically have to breakout the bread that will be used for the next day, clean all utensils and machinery in the bakery thoroughly, assist all customers, take inventory and stock the floor. This job taught me many valuable lessons such as cleaning quickly and efficiently, approaching customers that were children, food sanitation, and I was also taught how to organize my workstation. My coworkers were enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was making bales out of the stores cardboard for recycling. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to hang out cookies to the children that came to the bakery.

I always had great customer service, the customers would always come back looking for me to help them. I always took the initiative to come in start working on something. If I saw merchandise I would start working on it without a manager to tell me anything.

Great people. Questionable Management,"I had a fairly decent experience while working her when it came to day by day tasks and the people I worked with consistently. The majority of the workers I was with had an amazing attitude along with being respectable individuals. Unfortunately, I did not have a similar experience with their management team. There is a consistent lack of communication between not only them and their associates, but with other managers as well. This led to consistent a back and forth with direction which tended to leave the associates in a bad place when their tasks couldn't be completed due to constant redirection. Their promotional process is also fairly questionable. Feeling the need to advance up the ladder after two years of working in the same department, I applied for several department manager positions only to be met with either complete silence as to why I hadn't gotten the position, or unacceptable excuses such as ""the position was open, but was re-closed"". At a point, I had in fact waited for a position I had knowingly applied for only to see it posted back on our board about a month later. Overall, great people on the hourly scale, but management is something to watch out for.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Montgomery, IL",3/16/16,2016,3,16
Productivty at Wal-mart,"A typical day at work depends on the time of my shift. An early shift begins with checking the freight to see if there is anything to be stocked. We zone what is needed in our department of the store, meaning we turn labels to face customers and make sure it is neat as well as in order. An evening shift starts and ends the same way, except checking to see what is in the freight. I have learned to step out of my comfort zone to assist customers and I have received a greater knowledge on how to manage electronic devices. The management at Wal-mart is organized and understanding. My co-workers and I get along well and we know the main task is to get the job done. The hardest part of my job is working the rotations of being moved multiple times during a shift because it is not always easy to get work fully done.

"Retail setting, fast paced","I first started in pharmacy at Walmart. I was able to do on the job training and obtained my license while working there.

Everyone I worked with got along very well and we were all pretty close and were able to work well together. My manager was flexible and understanding and I enjoyed working for him. I would say the hardest part of the job was dealing with any angry patients we would have for any reason.

horrible,The management was never on the same page. I loved the people that I worked with. The people that I got to train were wonderful. I did rather enjoy the hour lunch break that we got.

All associates were very hard working and a great crew to work with. Our store had almost 300 employees and you new most by their first names.

I had a great experience at Walmart.",5,Former Employee,Sales ,"Ruskin, FL",3/14/16,2016,3,14
a complete zoo with no cage doors,so working at walmart these days means the job you sign up for is not the job you truly get. I myself worked wireless and got pulled every day for at least 4 hours of the day then you are pulling pallets past your department and you just see the pain and sadness on customers as they cant find anyone to help them. you will also have a manager yelling at you to get something done that isnt your department while another manager is rushing you so they can steal you to do the project they want you to do you get back to your department with just enough time to rush and scramble your stuff to look passable but really the shelf straightening and stocking looks rushed and you have to ignore customers to get that done. my co-workers were amazing and are some of the best friends i keep today. as far as the management goes i am pretty sure they pick these people based on how capable they are of dishing out punishment and not based off how skilled they are as leader of people,2,Former Employee,Connection Center Specialist ,"Wausau, WI",3/14/16,2016,3,14

WalMart is horrible.,"I recently worked at the Wal-Mart in Dearborn,MI and I must say that was the worst Wal-Mart I've ever been in.I worked in the grocery department and I must say that was the worst position Ive ever held.

ok,Walmart is a company that is horrible to work for they do not care about their workers and if a member of management does not like a person they will find a reason to get rid of them.

I really enjoyed my coworkers, and there were a few members of management that were just amazing at their job. However, many managers either micro managed or had impossible expectations.

it can be a fun place to work.  it depends on who is working. some are more fun than others,I mostly fill prescriptions.  I answer the phone.  I sometimes get to check in the drugs and put them up.  I don't get to do mush of the other jobs.  not because I can't it is just nobody like to fill.  they all like to stand at the drop off window.  I am the fastest filer they  have.

Worst place to ever work. Go to another Wal-Mart,Working at Wal-mart wasnt the worst but the manager made it a living underworld and made it very uncomfortable to come to work. They blame all the regular associates and no managers are ever at fault. They show favoritism and fire you for anything so they are severely understaffed and they will continue to fall downhill because they dont even make enough money or have the inventory they need to run properly.,1,Former Employee,Wireless Connections Associate ,"Pasadena, MD",3/13/16,2016,3,13

Great job but could use some adjustments,"Everyday I would arrive to work and know almost exactly what was expected to be done. While working on IMS my supervisor was absolutely fantastic. Down to earth, gave reasonable goals and made work enjoyable. I learned how to track inventory, binning, picking, stocking freight, how to unload a truck, stack pallets, move pallets with a pallet jack, electric pallet jack, walkie stacker and sit-down forklift. Most co-workers were pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job would have been the constant change in the way work would be done, but it's better for a company to try to adjust to maintain the proper work flow than to sit idly aside and fall behind. My most enjoyable part of working for Walmart would have to be my experiences even with the most difficult customers. It taught me patience and acceptance. The worst part of the job was constantly being tossed between full-time and part-time status. I personally was placed on full-time status which is the only way to receive benefits. Shortly after, the company pulled hours and after averaging out the quarter, all of my benefits were pulled. This happened to SEVERAL employees multiple times. Getting a full-time position and keeping it was almost impossible. The most I ever made while working for Walmart was $13,000 in a year.",4,Former Employee,IMS ,"Watseka, IL",3/13/16,2016,3,13

"Nice people, but low wages","Generally speaking, this job is good for college and high school students, or people trying to earn a little extra cash. There is room for advancement, but the entry level job really doesn't pay well. You will learn how to interact with customers, basic knowledge on using computers, how to run a cash register, and how to face shelving. These things give you a general sense as to how other retail stores work too. _x000D_I think the hardest part though, is trying to satisfy a frustrated customer's need while maintain a very positive attitude. It can be very challenging, but is balanced out by getting to work with happy customers who like to hold conversations during the transaction. You can definitely learn a lot about people from this job.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Murfreesboro, TN",3/12/16,2016,3,12
"Poor management team, poor communication between departments","First, when I started working at Walmart, seemed alright.

I've learned patience and integrity and how to be an inspiring leader. My co-workers are my family. I have adopted so many of them because lets face it, sometimes we see them more than our real family. I have a brother and a sister here, many cousins, and even an uncle or two. The most difficult part of the job seems to be communication. The only problem I've ever had is there is just a general problem getting the same information from any two members of management.",3,Current Employee,Department Supervisor ,"Algood, TN",3/9/16,2016,3,9
Enjoyable,A typical day at work would me walking in and going straight to the cash register or the customer service desk. What I learned at this job was patience.

Beware the management,"This particular store has a nasty reputation of firing you over the smallest thing, especially if you are not black. Also, if you get any ""write ups"" with the company it will stay on your record for a year and if you get another one before the one year is up it gets added to the new write up year. Also, it doesn't go away even if you quit and come back!",2,Former Employee,Dairy/Frozen Sales Associate ,"Montgomery, AL",3/9/16,2016,3,9

Secure job,"If you do your job and do not cause problems then you will be satisfied with the experience. That is as simple as it gets. I clock in.

Great place to learn skills and makee friends,I loved working at Walmart and have made a bunch of friends. The management team was a little lacking in the common sense role but its manageable. I learned basically everything i know about the world and technology from Walmart and its vendors. knowing the practice of safe usage of almost everything will help in the training of myself with other employers. Still needs people to work in all areas and at all times. That would have helped tremendously.,5,Former Employee,Associate ,"Maumee, OH",3/9/16,2016,3,9
Worst Job ever,"I worked with WalMart for 2 years, and really, your entire experience depends on your management team. If they are good, its an alright place to work. If they are bad, you end up hating your job, and your life as Walmart culture tries to make itself more important than anything else you have going on.",1,Former Employee,Electronics Supervisor ,"Potsdam, NY",3/9/16,2016,3,9
Okay as far as grocery stores go.,"Walmart Supercenter needs to learn how to be more friendly when dealing with customers. Employees were good to employees, but did not have that same attention towards customers. Some employees found a way to cheat on their scans per minute and management did not care. Management needs to be fixed as you have about 4 you report to. I had to go to a different person ever time I needed a day off or a change in schedule.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Lubbock, TX",3/9/16,2016,3,9

Unprofessional Work Environment,"I liked cashiering and the customers, and became very efficient at it.  I got along great with most co-workers, and managers.  However, some cashiers and managers were extremely unprofessional, and honestly embarrasing to be associated with at times.  Nothing was done to correct problems at the facility.  A new store manager came and things got much worse.  My favorite part of the job was working with my friends, and that includes the cashier managers.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Plant City, FL",3/9/16,2016,3,9
don't work here,I would not recommend working for this company if you are a hard working individual. This company will take advantage of that and offer no rewards for that hard work. They expect you to go above and beyond for them but care very little when your having problems with your work environment. They seem to intentionally hire managers who are unfriendly who don't know or bother to learn the jobs that they are managing. Very often the management team will conflict with themselves leaving you in the middle to figure out which manager to follow orders from.,2,Former Employee,Auto care center technician/Unlaoder ,"Grand Junction, CO",3/9/16,2016,3,9
Nice co workers,"I really enjoy interfacing with people.  Just wish the pay was more than $10.50 per hour.  Not a living wage!!  Hardest part of the job is being on my feet all day.

Walmart Distrubution Center Review,"I honestly appreciated the job for being there when I didn't have one. The fact that the pay was amazing at the time and the many of traits I learned in due time. However asking me I wouldn't expect anyone who isn't a Warehouse Veteran to work there ,, Mainly because the Boss at the Time at least wasn't really cordial with his fellow employees. Also its very fast pace like any warehouse should be ..

I really enjoyed working for walmart.,4,Former Employee,CASHIER / OVER NIGHT STOCKER/ REMODLE ,"Sumter, SC",3/9/16,2016,3,9
It is a big company with an eye on profit,Walmart had some really great people who worked with you well. Then there was the others who really did not want to work. Every place has that. It is a huge company who have lost touch with the associates. You don't feel appreciated there. They have a big employee turnover for a reason. Depending on the store manager it can be a good place to work or a really bad one.,3,Former Employee,Bakery Manager ,"Enterprise, AL",3/9/16,2016,3,9
Employment that should be far better than it is,"I started at Walmart having come from the field of construction and found that I actually liked the job more than I expected to. It didn't take long to understand that liking the job and being able to do the job better than many didn't matter when put up against a rule of law by management that amounts to ""do it the way the company says to do it, no matter how unreasonable, or you're fired"", almost always under the conditions of being understaffed. Policy states that there will be no personal feelings put into play when it becomes an issue between management and employees, yet employees are routinely fired for reasons that stem from personal issues with specific managers. And contacting the corporate office to report unfair treatment in the work environment tends to be a catalyst for dismissal. It's a shame that so many people who love their job to one degree or another must work in fear of losing it if they do not push themselves beyond their own limitations just to get the job done.",1,Current Employee,Supervisor ,"Burton, MI",3/9/16,2016,3,9

Best job so far!,"Eau Claire, Wisconsin Wal-Mart is an ideal place to work. Pay was excellent for the work I was doing. Breaks were well spaced and gave you time to recharge. Management was extraordinary and coworkers were just as fantastic. Wal-Mart did many things for their employees they did not have to do. Bosses made you feel appreciated and cared for. You worked close to your co-workers and got to speak to them frequently and get to know them. Excellent starting job, room to grow and quite possibly a job for life. I highly recommend.",5,Former Employee,IMS / Unloader ,"Eau Claire, WI",3/9/16,2016,3,9
Unfortunately Abysmal,"Management at Walmart leaves much to be desired._x000D_They will ask employees ""can you drive around it"" when they call in to say that there are downed powerlines and telephone poles [which is dangerous]_x000D_They treat customers rather poorly in the fact that they say ""Come in when you are sick and we will tell you if you are too sick to work"".

Productive,"Walmart was my first and only job out of high school.  A typical day at work was fast paced.  While working for Walmart I learned that working hard for my money was rewarding and paid off.  I liked my co-workers, as they made each day enjoyable.

The most enjoyable part was knowing that I put in the effort and earned my paychecks.",3,Former Employee,Orderfiller ,"Ochelata, OK",3/8/16,2016,3,8
Good Times. Good People,"I started working at walmart on a whim, i needed a job having been out of work for a month or so and so i applied, not taking it to seriously at the time. I got called the next day. I had an interview the same week. _x000D__x000D_I had no prior experience, no knowledge of what all they do at walmart. I worked overnights as a stocker. I worked there for 4 years. In the 4 years i worked there there was a lot of changes. A Lot. _x000D__x000D_The changes were always for the better, things did improve so much since i had started. Some changes didn't always work out though but in general everything just kept on moving. Management ranged from lazy/incompetent to real firm/serious_x000D__x000D_Overall though Management got the job done and the store always ran smooth. In fact this particular walmart is a star child. Its a store that corporate walmart people use for meetings and they have an office in the back. _x000D__x000D_So the expectation of having the store extra clean and everything done was always top priority. We have an awesome team and thats really the only reason I stayed for so long, was the people. At walmart I believe the people really make the difference. This job was pretty mundane, and pretty easy. _x000D__x000D_You come in, you stock shelves, do some inventory management, clean up and go home. But making the connections, and friends and really getting to know everyone was probably the best part of the job for me.

Fun workplace and great break room,First thing I do when I clock in for work is head to the back room where the team is and we start putting down pallets.  Pulling the truck would have to be the hardest thing about the job.  I enjoy sitting in the break room with the team joking and laughing.  Our mangers and supervisors are a great part of working their because they know how to have a good time and also know when it's time to get to work.

It was a great learning experience for me as far as being moved around and learning many new things about the store and how each department functions. There were some managers that were unapproachable, but there were some that helped me out many times. The hardest part was having to cover so many tasks on an extremely busy day.

this place needs improvement,For walmart to be as big as it is you would think they'd take care of their employees. Its one thing to tell me I'm on the clock for so long but is another thing to ask me to stay and help clean up the slack of someone else. At times we didn't have enough people to cover every department and we would have at the most 2-3 departments per person which needed to be completed within an 8 hour shift,2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Houston, TX",3/8/16,2016,3,8
Worst employment,"Wal~Mart is the worst employment and roughest part of my life to date. I worked at the store over night shift stocking shelves. In this job management required you to do the work at the speed they asked regardless of how impossible it seemed. Your work would be required to be done three, sometimes four times as fast then the allocated time you had. Three hours of work was expected to be done in an hour and a half, with no questioned asked. For this job you would also be required to be cross trained and be able to work every department in the store, even if your job details do not have the job listed, In example, stockers would also be doing frozen section, cooler sections, Inventory, back room processing. They pay these positions differently and expect you to do the job without the pay. The management here, probably shouldn't exist because it's so bad, managers are always running around giving orders, watching you do your work making sure you're doing it fast enough and not for one moment slacking or taking breaks. When something is needed and a manager isn't around you have to locate a manager in the store by walking around to find one. Also managers are usually in the office playing card games on the computer while you're expect to be superman. Because wal~mart has never really been up to par with their equipment the pallet jacks where always broken. The bearings were always busted and it made moving 1500 lb pallets close to impossible, but it needed to be done.",1,Former Employee,Grocery stocker ,"Auburn, ME",3/8/16,2016,3,8

Fun Place to work but heavy handed,I have to say working at Wal-Mart was a wonderful experience but their management style leaves a lot to be desired. Most of the time people walking around with no idea of what they are to be doing and sometimes You can never find someone to ask as to what needs to be done next.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Duncan, OK",3/8/16,2016,3,8
workplace environment,I loved working at the Wal-Mart.  It was very satisfying to accomplish your work and make something for the public to use and want or need.  I have learned that the more you apply yourself the more you can accomplish. My co-workers were very easy for the most part to get along with and the ones that I supervised were willing to do whatever I needed them to do.  The hardest part of my job at the Wal-mart was if we weren't able to help someone how disappointing that felt.  I always wanted my customers to be able to purchase whatever they were needing. The management was fairly good.  My immediate supervisor was wonderful.  He would help me with whatever I needed.  I enjoyed working with the public.  I found it to be very appealing and satisfying to me.,4,Former Employee,Department Manager/Customer Service Manager ,"Levelland, TX",3/8/16,2016,3,8
Boring back-breaking work.,"This is definitely a job you do for the sake of paying rent. You spend 8 hours a night stocking shelves as quickly and as accurately as possible. This task is more difficult than it sounds mainly due to the lack of necessary equipment such as pallet jacks, L-carts, and handheld scanners. You also have to help customers throughout the night though they're pretty cool, management at this Walmart during 3rd-shift is cool too. _x000D__x000D_After you're done stocking what you can you have to take your overstock (the leftovers) to the back and print out labels for them and then put them on a shelf. Again, you run into the problem of not having the necessary equipment to do this job._x000D__x000D_For the most part, Walmart is a okay-to-bad place to work on just the stuff I mentioned above. What makes this job awful is that they no longer pay overtime for working holidays but instead offer vacation pay. The problem with this is that if you are a part-timer (which you probably will be) you have to work an entire year just  to get one day of paid vacation._x000D__x000D_At the end of the day this job just isn't worth it unless your're hard up for cash.

Walmart Has Bad Management,"Walmart paid better than average, but that is the only good thing that I can say about them. They never replaced workers when they called in, but expected the staff to do more work. Management instead of helping when we were slammed and shortstaffed would yell at us employees in front of customers! They also like to cut hours unexpectedly. My hours went from about 35 hours per week to 6! I was scheduled for only 6 hours a week for three weeks straight! This was despite me being told what a good worker I was. They also like to fire long-term employees for bogus reasons, because they make too much money.

No work/life balance,"They typical day at Walmart would be to provide customer service, merchandise, and pinpoint areas for profit losses and adjust accordingly. I learned a lot about the inner workings of retail, and got a better understanding of company financials and trends. As a salaried member of management, the expectation is that you are at work everyday including off days with no real compensation. On the off chance of an illness, upper management shows no concern for the health or wellbeing of the associate and strongly suggests that if one is not on their deathbed, they should be at work (this is to include scheduled off days). The hardest part about my job at Walmart is working between 10 and 20 hours a day, spending a few hours resting at home only to do it again the next day.

Management has to be strong but also be willing to step in when needed and not expect their team to handle it all, coworkers learn to be like family and share a bond like no other for the most part. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with the people who decide to be dishonest and they have their children with them and you have to decide what is best situation for the children, or when you have to call a parent because their child has been dishonest, Most enjoyable aspect as working with all types of people and also the customers as they can be very enlightening",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Bakersfield, CA",3/5/16,2016,3,5

Management was not the greatest, managers were not around very much to answer any questions an employee had. Co-workers tend to keep to themselves, wouldn't talk much to each other giving the work environment an awkward feeling. The hardest part of the job was when we'd get a truck full of items that was a bigger load then usual and we'd have to get it all done before our shift was over. All an all the job itself was very easy.

"Good job, but never a steady hours.",Enjoyable at times. Typical food establishment. Great pay as a driver. Be prepared to work at dinner rush.

I did not like this at all,You get to work and you have a 10-15 minute meeting and you are assigned which isles to stock. Walmart is not a union job so some things that go on are very different and seem unfair such as a machine telling you how fast you should do your job not considering if you have 20-50 pounds boxes to pick up from the ground onto a 5 foot shelf.,2,Former Employee,Over night Stocker ,"St. Louis, MO",3/4/16,2016,3,4

I learned how to work in a warehouse environment. Management could do a better job of understanding the individual work load, especially that of the shipping loaders.

"Store level is pretty solid, upper management debateable.","A hectic day at work is a typical one. The particular store I was at had solid staff whom seemed determined to keep everyone on board, but at their same level. For some reason, corprate thought we needed to cut down on payroll, but the store was at a skeleton crew at best. They do toss you around where you are needed most, as anywhere that is different than your typical area is better every now and again. All in all, however, I would prefer to not work there again, as they don't look at you for a transfer to a different department or higher position until you have lost the will to work in that store in the first place.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Ponca City, OK",3/3/16,2016,3,3
good place to work,I would get to work talk to a member of management and see what they would like me to do. I would either stock shelve or pick items out of bins and put them on a cart. then I would unload the truck in the afternoon. I learned that to have a good running business you need the people who are in the backroom to have products accurately in the bins to better serve the customers. I liked working with management they were very helpful. Most of the time you were working alone.

Great Improvement,Walmart was a great experience for me because of all the different types of jobs within the company. I started off as a sales associate which consisted of staying on the sales floor and keeping shelves stocked and presentable. Then I was trained as a cashier and rang customers up when we were very busy and there weren't enough cashiers to get lines down. After that I was switched to an unloader which was a much harder job for me due to my size but I was given a pay raise and I gained a lot of experience and strength. I had many problems with my coworkers because I was the smallest on the team but managers always said I was the hardest worker and that hit a nerve for a lot of people. Overall I enjoyed my Walmart experience and made many close connections with great managers.,4,Current Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Cromwell, CT",3/3/16,2016,3,3
Pay rate doesn't match personal resposibilities,"Overall Walmart is a good place to work during times of emergency.  Their pay rate is a bit too low as compared to the competition.  One of the biggest challenges is having to deal with the wide variety of personality types.  Other than that, most of my co-workers have been very nice people.  The hardest part of the job is being under too much time pressure.  Walmart is not a hospital.  I believe the stress levels are very unnecessary.  One of the most enjoyable aspects of the job is being able to learn a wide variety of other tasks and positions.  You are not stuck just doing one thing over and over again.  I probably won't make Walmart my career type job.  It is a great place to work part-time only.  I would highly recommend people choose Walmart only as one of their final options.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Shelf Stocker ,"Katy, TX",3/3/16,2016,3,3

"fun,","I would sign in and go straight to the cash register I was assigned to.Then my supervisor would inform me of what needs to be done at that time,if there was anything specific.My main job was to help the customers with whatever they needed and to cash them out. In between that I would water all the flowers and put away merchandise that would need to be stocked on to the shelves. I always kept my self busy doing this or just sweeping and dusting.I got along with the coworkers great. I learned that the customer is always right. I have a very friendly attitude so I didn't experience but one or two disgruntled customers and was told by management that they were like that to everyone. To be honest the hardest part of the job was the hour long lunch break. The best part of the job was meeting new people every day.And the regulars too.

Productive,"You get your averaged angry customers who don't get there way most of the times. Then you get you average nicer customers that enjoy their shopping at Wal-Mart. I know that you have to be very patience with all customers, no matter what mood they are in. The management is a total bum. They try to help the very best they can, but sometimes they are not reliable. The people I work with can be a little annoying, but dealing with a job like Wal-Mart you have to learn to get along and work together. I think the hardest part of my job is dealing with angry customers. Most of the time you can deal with and calm down an angry customer, but when you can't everything just turns ugly for everybody. The thing I enjoy most about my job is the compliments I get daily. I love providing the best service to my customers.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service ,"Central, SC",3/1/16,2016,3,1
Is what you make of it,"As with most job this is what you make of it.

Great place to work for a 1st job,Walmart was my very first job. I started off as a day-time cashier but it conflicted with my schedule so I moved to overnight. I was on the register for only a couple of months and got tired of it because I couldn't stand at the register all night. I got bored. So I switched again finally to overnight stocking and it was so much better. My coworkers and management were amazing and everyone was so helpful.

"Okay Work, Terrible Management","The problem with Walmart isn't the work, its the incompetence of your Supervisors and Managers. Employee don't come first, the priority for anyone in a management position is to move higher up the chain, and will pull dirty tricks to get a one-up on the others._x000D__x000D_My biggest problem is the constantly shifting policies regarding pay and sick-days, as well as how people are hired into supervisor positions. We got notice for about 3 months that Maintenance would soon need a supervisor, so two of the actual members of our team applied, since they both have the experience and knowledge to do handle the extra work. Instead a STOCKER was promoted, who knew nothing about any of our cleaning supplies or machinery, and who always pushed the extra workload that he was hired to take off our backs and threw it back onto us, instead preferring to sweep all night, or reorganize our entire work area to the point where we couldn't even find the normal supplies most nights and we'd have to run around the store looking for them.",1,Former Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Johnsburg, IL",2/28/16,2016,2,28

"Easy to get hired, but not recommended","Working at Wal-mart felt like a battle every day. The store was constantly understaffed so each associate's workload was far greater than it was supposed to be. There were zero third shift IMS associates at the time I had left because they moved their only one to another position, shoving the duties of third shift onto first. Of the fifty or so Telxon scanners in the store only about ten were available at any one time because associates would hide them around the store and in locked lockers or lose them completely, most pallet jacks were broken and there were often times we did not have enough to properly do our jobs and many carts had missing handles or damaged wheels. Many associates were thrown around to pick up slack and schedules were incredibly unpredictable, giving you almost no time to plan for necessary things like doctors appointments. Many customers were rude and disrespectful and associates were threatened with loss of job for not staying late to finish other peoples' work while simultaneously being told if they went over-time they would be fired. Most co-workers were friendly, though many were lazy and one even hid in the corner of the store to avoid doing work on several occasions. The Manager and Assistant Managers ranged from pleasant to extremely disgruntled and many refused to actually send help to finish urgent projects, like unloading a truck in 45 minutes because two drivers decided to dock at the same time and a third was on the way, despite telling the workers it was urgent.

"Good idea, bad management","The Idea of Walmart is a great idea, but it has been run by greedy and callus people. When i worked at Walmart i was forgotten many occasions when i was supposed to be relieved, and got locked out of my register and was punished for running my register for over 6 hours straight on several occasions when it is management that is supposed to relieve me. Worked several 24 hour shifts because people did not feel like coming into work, and they showed favoritism as those people were never punished. Myself and a few others had to do others jobs because they did not feel like getting up from the chair they were sitting on, and management said that since they did not feel like getting up we had to do those jobs. They would not give me my overtime pay even when i worked well over 76 hours a week, and Stated they would not make anyone a Full time employee, due to having to pay healthcare insurance._x000D__x000D_Walmart was a great intention but has become a disgrace to anything its creator might have first intended it to be.",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Kemah, TX",2/18/16,2016,2,18
"Was fun workplace , Love working with the customers.",I loved trying to get customers rung out the fastest. Getting to know them and tried to make there shop there the easiest I could. I learned it's great to get along with the people you work with but not to take it more than a work relationship. I learned a lot about retail and what it takes to keep a fast pace and friendly customer service at the same time. Also a lot about zone and time management when there where no customer's. Management wasn't the best as I said before knowing to keep work relationships work and not friendships it is not fair your worker that if they are not your friend that they get different treatment. I loved most of my co-workers got along great. The hardest part of the job was management and the unfair treatment. The most enjoyable part was truly helping the customers in anyway just making there day easier brought me a lot of joy.,5,Former Employee,cashier ,"Arden, NC",2/18/16,2016,2,18
Decent job,"My experience with Walmart was not the worst, but also not the best. For the most part the customers were pretty friendly. Management would sometimes change my schedule the day before and not give any notification, which resulted in me being late a few times. I felt like that was unprofessional and unfair.

Customer Satisfaction,"A typical work day at Wal-Mart consists of Planning your day. The first thing you do is review the schedule to see who you have in the building to plan out your day. I usually supervise 40-50 people a day. This includes Department managers, supervisors, cashiers, service areas, vendors, office associates cash office, and Pharmacy. I delegate task for everyone and follow up throughout the day. Time management and following up and building relationships are the most important things I have learned. Management has to communicate with one another constantly to ensure all projects are being completed in a timely manner, and to make sure our associates are being taken care of. The hardest part of my job is the consistency and routine, Wal-mart changes almost daily. They require certain things to be done in a timely manner. And it may be asked on short notice. This can be challenging but it keeps it interesting. The most enjoyable part of my job are the associates and customers. My store has  a small town feel to it, everyone knows everyone. Everyone feels like family.",1,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Prince Frederick, MD",2/17/16,2016,2,17

Not the best job,"Walmart is not the worst place to work, it is also not the best. There is a lot of grade school drama that takes place at every Walmart. Favoritism is absolutely a thing and if your not afraid to pretend and play suck it up you will be better off. Asst. Managers won't give you credit to higher ups so don't expect it. They may say you did a good job, but if you fixed their mistake and did a great job they will take the credit. Asst. Managers are also very shady, behind the scenes they all jokey for position while throwing colleagues and lower tier employees under the bus. If you want to move up you have to play the game. If your looking for just another job then it is a decent one._x000D__x000D_Also if you are a hard worker and have a good work ethic be prepared to see a majority of the employees work much lighter loads than you.

Don't Get Stuck Here,"Management treats subordinates as if they are uneducated, inferior, and an annoyance. Honesty and openness are not displayed in dealing with store management; employees are often surprised with their infractions and blind-sided with disciplinary actions without being given an opportunity to speak to the situation.

The worst place to work!,I was hired to work with Walmart. They are set to train you and management never did. I have never worked in retail before so this was a whole new ball park for me. My first day management told me to go to the girls section and she would be right back to show me what needed to be done. She never came back. For a week this has been going on. I go to find management and it is all the same. They say they will train you and they never come around. I have tried to get my schedule and if you call they hang up on you. If you go in and try to get it they say they will get it in a min. and your never get it.  You are put in to learn trial by fire. No training what so ever. Then  you get in trouble for not knowing what to do. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

"If you want to work hard, this can be a rewarding company","Experiences within this company vary by location. I've had great treatment at some stores, and made life-long friendships. And I've also felt unwanted and under-appreciated at others that employ rude, hateful employees that work the bare minimum because there is a lack of incentive to work harder. In some cases the harder you work, the more is expected, and when you have an off-day when things are just not going right for you, there is a chance for coachings. I think the culture is not what it used to be, and definitely not what Sam Walton wanted. It's sad to see the look of despair on people's faces when they leave work. But, if you are looking for something to pay bills while going to school or just looking for extra cash to pay bills, it definitely fits that purpose.",4,Current Employee,CAP1 ,"Rogers, AR",2/16/16,2016,2,16
Great pay but the turn-over rate was pretty horrible.,"I loved the ladies who had been at this job for years. You could see it that they loved their job and worked hard at it. Food Safety was a major player in this job. If you were caught at all trying to not follow the rules. You risked getting written up as your first offense. Second time, you were fired on the spot. I loved my management here. Very understanding and very professional. I never blamed the management for any of the problems here. Often we would have new hires who just couldn't cut it. They would last a week before quitting or calling in constantly. Often the hardest part of the job was having to close with only one other person who left at 9pm and you have to clean the entire Deli(which is a 3 person job) by yourself. Might I add, your not allowed to go over 11pm. Or you risk by Walmart Policy a write up for going into overtime. At this point I was still Part-Time and desperate to earn Full-Time. I often was given pretty hard task that most new hires ran from. But, I did the job willingly because I loved knowing I did it..Because it was done right versus some of our other night shift employee's who hated doing it and sometimes cut corners. I did enjoy the ladies who were Full-Time. I often still go in and say ""Hello"" to them from time to time. This is a job I would deffently return to.

They do have there bbq's and  lunch ins once in a while as well as Bonus pay. Although they base the bonus on how many hours you worked, and tend to cut them back for you a week before your bonus.

I personally saw a coworker, who started the same day I did, was no better at his job than I (we both worked in electronics), and did not seem to work any harder than I, get fast tracked to management. This was merely because he had a better rapport with key members of management. _x000D__x000D_  Certain people were constantly allowed to shirk responsibility, be tardy, and so on without consequence,while others were disciplined, often for lesser infractions. People's personal opinions dictated how they treated others, usually those of a lower position.They were not very accommodating those with disabilities (myself included), misplacing paperwork, and sometimes opting to fire people instead of giving them their due accommodations. I was one such person. The manger who fired me had only been there a week and fired me, despite know that I had a disability that affected my work. _x000D__x000D_  Another issue I had is that I worked at a new store and we were not trained prior to the store opening, though I was there a week or so. The store opened, and we knew next to nothing about our jobs. Needless to say the customers were not aware which made things difficult at first._x000D__x000D_  That being said I liked my Department manager, she was nice.

Redundant work with too many bosses contradicting one another,We had two guys on the docks unloading and we were both young and hardworking. We could unload trucks in a better than average time frame. One mngr would say good job another would say speed it up!

Decent job but frequently stressful,A typical day at work in the deli was very fast-paced. I learned about food safety and gained customer service skills. Management often had conflicting views on policy and procedure. My co-workers were friendly but became noticeably stressed under pressure.

Productive and fun place to be when we would all get together in the break room and play paper games.,A typical day at work would have to be a customers being mean to me for no reason. What I learned everyday is that all people aren't the same. The management wasn't always fair. My co-workers and I rarely talk during the work time because I would always be too focused on correctly doing my work. The hardest part of the job was to keep an unsatisfied customer happy without hurting their feelings.

Walmart Review,Overall Walmart was an awesome place to work at. The employees there are great and the pay was nice for that line of work. I enjoyed going to work and being able to help customers. The management on the other hand seemed to never have time for you and your needs. You almost had to beg them if you needed something done.

Not a place I would want to stay with permantly.,The hours for full time scheduled 9 hours. You get a 1 hour lunch. There are sometimes & hours with a half hour lunch. The basic of retail and stocking and customer care is what you learn. Management don't seem concerned for employees only customers or friends. Most coworkers make it feel as though you are back in high school. They create a highly stressful environment. The hardest thing on the job is dealing with peoples attitudes everyday customers and employees alike. The good thing about the job is meeting new people and being able to be home everyday when job is done.,3,Current Employee,Retail Associate ,"North Charleston, SC",2/12/16,2016,2,12

"Fast Pace,Productive, Stable Work Place","Very lively up beat place to work at all times. I learned multiple hands on skills and the ins and outs of numerous departments. Management takes there time to make sure you feel very comfortable, and you make a good fit in the work place. Co-workers are very helpful most of the time, and does make the job easier for everyone instead a ton of work piled to one person. The hardest part of the job in my opinion, would be making sure nothing is left undone, when at times the store could have a influx of items from time to time depending on the season.

My time with the company was short due to relocating so I did not get to know management to well. My coworkers and I usually always get along simply by me being a hard working friendly team member.

Giant evil corporation,"Sometimes, working for a giant evil corporation is good. There's tons of room to move up and life gets really easy once you get up there. Moving up can be difficult though, depending on how the specific store is run. Sometimes they'll hire managers from other companies or straight out of college. There's lots of favoritism and corporate politics. They don't care if you're the best person in the world for a certain position you want, if someone they like more wants it then you're SOL. _x000D__x000D_   Overall, I don't regret working there.

Able to make your own hours but the work environment was tense.,The company allowed people to make their own hours and I also enjoyed the weekly pay. Unfortunately this wasn't a company that rewarded people for hard work.

"Good benefits, everything else stinks","Walmart used to be a good company to work for but has gone downhill fast.

Largest retail company with long-term growth projections and geographic market presence.,"Walmart ISD is a multi-cultural company with a strong financial portfolio.  I was attracted to it over other companies because of its emphasis on Work-life Balance.  The compensation was lower  and the standard expected hours per week is 45 hours for salary employees.  Direct report managers and above are required to attend monthly/bimonthly Saturday meeting.  Moving to various departments are encouraged, but easier said then done. _x000D_The compensation compare to similar position in AT&T was $20,000 less annually.

Not good work enviroment,When I worked there it was a place that all the employees hated to be.

I learned how to lead by following their example. I worked with a really good team. They were on the same page with me. If they had any advice or concerns I would hear what they had to say and do something about it.

A great work environment,"My opinion of working for Wal-Mart is that it is a good, steady place of employment. I began working for the company as a cashier in high school, and since graduating I have been able to advance within the company. They are great at giving opportunity to those who want it. I enjoy working with my fellow associates. I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience by going into different departments and learning how to do different tasks around the store. The part of working for Wal-Mart that makes it difficult on a day-to-day basis is the lack of communication within the store and between the management team.

Rather Entertaining From The Outside,"A typical day of work consisted of untrained employees, myself included, being given sections of the store to watch over, then being told by others to go work on something unassigned to us. Thus, by lunch we had only one section done, four bosses angry at us, and a full store with customers nearly as confused as we are as to where items are. _x000D_It was as though going back to high school once more, instead of coming in to a work place. If one was not the youngest, prettiest little thing, then they were given the majority of the work, whereas the younger women were given the easier jobs of standing around all day gossiping. Unfortunately, I wish I were only speaking from an enraged former employee's point of view. _x000D_Customers had to seek out the employees that were new and untrained in the back departments in order to get help for things that were supposed to be held in the front departments. _x000D__x000D_While I was rather annoyed about these factors, I did learn several things about time management, customer service, how to re-price items, and most importantly, how to deal with co-workers professionally in a civil manner._x000D__x000D_The hardest, but ultimately most enjoyable part of the job for me, was the sorting, and then creating of the displays.

"Poor management, poor wages.","Walmart workers are some of the hardest working people in retail and don't get paid nearly enough for all the abuse they handle from their customers, and more especially management, daily. Nearly every manager is related to another manager in the store somehow, or are their best friend outside of work. It's impossible to promote. If you have 2 written warnings, you are literally ""un-promotable"". Once you are at the next level of write-up, your write-up count doesn't drop to the lower level when one drops off, it doesn't change until they are ALL gone (say you get a 3rd written warning on March 3rd, but your first 2 write-ups drop off in May and June, you still have ""3"" write-ups until the following March, unless you get a 4th one, in which case you're fired). They just announced a new pay-scale for people and people that are getting hired after Feb 20th will be making at least $10/hr. They are switching from 7 pay grades to 4 (A, B, C and D) and if you already make more than the minimum for that position (no matter how long you've been with the company) you will only be getting a 2% pay raise. For example, my position is going from a current minimum of $9.90/hr to $10.50/hr, but I make more than that, so instead of getting a .60 cent raise to match the minimum raise, I'm only getting a 2% raise, which is .21 cents.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Desk ,"Redmond, OR",2/5/16,2016,2,5

Overall Good place to start,"Typically when employed at my location, my time there was bittersweet. There was certainly so much good affiliated with working here, from ample mandatory breaks, easy scheduling and capability to pick up shifts, friendly coworkers, helpful atmosphere when newly employed, and many perks of being an employee of wal-mart. As I had stated there was alot of good from this company, but unfortunately it was also accompanied by the bad as well, such as poor communication from management to their abundant staff, lack of supervision of the staff, the aforementioned ""perks"" (i.e. Only receiving them after being employed for a period of time longer than either 90 days or 6 months), all of this gave me some mixed emotions about my specific store.

Typical work day with finger pointing managers,"Most days working at Wal-Mart were just very typical days. Most days were shuttling carts in a large parking lot and into two bays with 8 rows of parking by myself and no help. This also included managers expecting you to pull miracles and such. Lunch breaks and breaks were very standard, 2) 15 minute breaks, and a half hour lunch. These days also included managers coming out and channeling their anger out on you because someone else screwed up. Most assistant managers were very clueless of their job titles, let alone, very clueless of customers and other associates around them. My co-workers were just average or young workers taking their first foot steps into the work force of an actual job. some co-workers would also try and drag you under the bus with them when least expected because they can't hold themselves up when you are very capable of doing so.",3,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Colorado Springs, CO",2/4/16,2016,2,4

Easy reliable job,"I loved working at walmart. I find most cashier jobs to be super easy, but definitely boring during down times and you've finished all your duties. In a bigger city people might not experience any down time and that's the fun part. You get to meet new people and time goes by super fast when you constantly have people coming in. I know walmart provides benefits for their employees, but I was not there long enough to experience their benefits. If a emergency comes up they're really good about working with you. I wasn't there long enough to advance, but they did have plenty of opportunities. I know a lady who has work at Walmart for 10 years and was never offered any kind of advancement in the company. CSM positions are really easy to get and I don't think they every have enough CSMs especially at the Supercenters. All I can say is I loved the job and while I was there they treated me very well and never game me more hours than I could handle.  They're really good about working with high school students and college students.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Texarkana, TX",2/4/16,2016,2,4

Environment with mostly supportive co-workers,"A typical work day for me involved me coming in to the office and reviewing paperwork or notes from my supervisor, going over footage from previous work days to ensure that a file was complete and making surveillance rounds on the sales floor. I learned how to operate a company wide database, that held information about open cases, and how to check security equipment to make sure that they were in regulation. I worked in an office space that was separate from the other management staff but worked closely with them. In the event that there was a state or district wide incident or alert I kept in contact with management from other stores as well. My co-workers were friendly and supportive, as well as helpful in assisting with cases that they had knowledge of. There were not any parts of the job that presented as difficult or hard, as long as the workload was maintained and the job was done correctly, everything ran smoothly. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to travel to other stores and work with their asset protection teams.

"Very busy, fast paced","On a typical day at Walmart, we would have several people call in which would have us re-evaluate our work strategy.  At times we were able to try to call in other employees to cover, some days there just wasn't anyone to call.  I learned management skills, how to deal with conflicting personalities whether it was between employees or between an employee and a customer.  Time management was also learned since many things can change in an instant.  Use every moment of your day to do something-no time to stop.  Many days you only got a short lunch with no breaks, some days you got all breaks and lunches.  I learned to prepare ahead for money needed at the Customer Service Manager podium, the Money Center, and Customer Service.  Preparing money for easy distribution/exchange with cashiers was a must.  Keeping money on hand for loans was also a necessity.  I really enjoyed working with the different employees on the front end.

Secure work environment,"Walmart is a fast paced, get it done no matter what type of environment. It is geared for the best multi-taskers in the retail world and a strong solid work ethic is necessary to succeed within their environment. The daily routine is set with high expectations of what needs to be accomplished by the end of each workers shift; regardless of the amount of staff that is on hand to assist or the number of customer issues that must be addressed. Senior Management is known for its direct, often abrasive and focused approach in order to be successful within their operations. There is an apparent lack of training and teaching for success mentality vs. a just get the job done and let the chips fall where they may approach within the operations. The hourly staff is, for the most part, focused and willing to do what is needed to help in the daily accomplishment of those set goals, however in this environment workers attendance is the main issue when it comes to the accomplishment of those set goals. Proper staffing is also an issue, while hiring goes through phases and increases or decreases seasonally, the work load or expectations does not adjust accordingly. Recently, there has also been a redirection of company goals and the direction it is going in as the world's leading retail establishment; which is yet to be seen as successful moves by the company. Overall, the most enjoyable part of this company is the people that you work with on a daily basis, while there is not a good balance with work and outside home life at times, it is the people that you work with that makes it an endurable - more...",3,Current Employee,Assistant Manager/Manager ,"Muncie, IN",2/3/16,2016,2,3

Sometimes the managers had different opinions on how they wanted stuff to be done, so we had to keep doing them a number of ways constantly. Co workers were some of the nicest people I've met and still talk to some of them to this day.
