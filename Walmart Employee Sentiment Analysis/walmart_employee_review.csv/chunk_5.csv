Disorganized and exhausting ,"They expect you to work super-fast they don't care about organization but speed, the inventory is a disaster nothing is on location, this disorganization makes you over work, the Store Managers doesn't have the knowledge or training to treat employees, you start to work without any training, and you have to learn by yourself. worst experience ever.

Management cared at first and made good friends.,"Everything was fine the first 2 years but management changed and the verbal agreements held by the original management no longer kept and when I got sick with covid my pay didn't keep , I got 300 for a normal 600 to 800 pay. Then my gallbladder started acting up and I couldn't keep up with everything and had to go to the hospital. After being rushed home after 2 days of surgery my manager begged me to come in even after I sent over what happened.

Easy job for decent pay,"Honestly if you want a job where you can advance up the ladder, I would not suggest this place. I work my behind off and don't get any appreciation.

Just a job,"The pay isn't good, and more is expected of some employees than others. Management was not the worst, but the entire system there I felt was meant to divide and conquer employees.

Management was pretty terrible.,"The management most often times were pretty hostile, and when you would talk to a specific manager's higher up they would say they would talk with them and then nothing would be done. People got reprimanded for things we couldn't control, such as not getting a certain area done within a reasonable give to the time limit, but we were never given the time allotted to the task in the first place. I quit specifically because the managers at my workplace were extremely hostile, there were obviously one or two that weren't so...(for lack of a better phrase) assholey? I was only there for maybe 3 months and around the end, I was so stressed out that when I got sick with the flu, I felt more relief than illness. I physically couldn't bring myself to go back.

They expect you to go above and beyond when other employees do want they want and barely work or do anything.. THEY WILL WRITE YOU UP OVER THE SMALLEST THINGS. The managers in the department doesn't get along.

"Bad management, terrible scheduling","My time at Walmart was spent having my managers take out their frustration on me during the holidays, never scheduling enough ppl or having ppl who can actually preform the task they are assigned. The managers never gave enough time for the task the assigned. Would have to work twice as hard because they would give task that 2-3 ppl would need to be doing to get it done on time to 1 person. I would have to work 2-3 departments at once because they would never hire new staff to help take the pressure off. The discount wasn’t even worth it.

They knew we were understaffed and never tried to fix it. They didn’t allow us to work overtime, and would send us home early at the end of the week so that the managers can get a bonus instead. You have to earn any PTO you are able to use by working your butt off. We worked our butts off and were in so much pain we could barely walk, and we still got told it wasn’t enough. In addition to all of this, they will change your normal off days at the last minute and let you get in trouble for missing it.

Management does not care about the employees. I was assaulted by an associate and I lost my job.

Poor management,"When I worked at Walmart, the worst part of every single day was the management. We had maybe three or four tolerable team leads, and two coaches that I could stand. The rest of the management at our store were completely incompetent and undeserving of their title and pay grade. There are only two reasons that I stayed for as long as I did; I bonded with my coworkers over how miserable we were, and it was the only place in town that payed above minimum wage, but the money honestly was NOT worth it. I hated working there, and I hope to never have to return there again. ",1,Former Employee,Apparel Sales Associate ,"Vidor, TX",12/16/21,2021,12,16
It's okay ,"I like working there but there is alot of favoritism, people get blamed alot for things other people did.

They don't talk to you just talk about you  There are a few really great team leads and there's some that just should step down.

Favoritism ,"Was a Deli/Bakery employee for over a year, was treated poorly by both the TL of bakery and TL of produce. No matter how many open door procedures I did, or went to HR or upper management nothing was done which resulted in my decision to leave. The deli TL was and is still a great colleague and manager to have, alwaysstuck up for myself. If management was better they’d be able to keep staff, having one person close a deli/bakery is near impossible and having nobody to do anything but be behind a counter the entire time while juggling other tasks was almost too difficult to complete.

"Great coworkers, Lots of growth possible, Fluctuating shifts, Some customers are rude and abusive","Many great people working hard under difficult circumstances. MY coach was great, but some are not supportive or respectful to associates. You can move up in the company very easily as long as you show up and do the work. Many opportunities for those who work for them. Like every job, it has its ups and downs. The schedule wasn't great, constantly shifting from early morning (5 am-2 pm, 7 am-4 pm) to closing shifts (2-11 pm). Hardest thing to deal with was rude and abusive customers. Most enjoyable were the friendships with other associates and the good customer interactions. ",3,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"Muskego, WI",12/15/21,2021,12,15
Not Even a Good Stepping Stone,"Absolutely horrible place to work. Number 1, you can't even complete tasks given to you before being put to do other tasks. You end up forgetting about the tasks you first started doing. My co-workers at this location...some were alright, however, the ones on my team I couldn't stand. The hours provided at this company would force anyone to rely on government aid. It's not a good place to earn a living. You would definitely need another job. You'd get questioned as if you're a criminal. I brought candy in the store from home and was questioned where did I get it as if I stole it. Skeleton staff. This is a safety issue as well as it prevents you from getting your work done as you are essentially responsible for almost a third of the store in the mornings. This also results in horrible customer service. ",1,Former Employee,Store associate ,"Woodstock, GA",12/15/21,2021,12,15
Mislead to believe someone would call me to start working after training.,"I was hired last month and went through training and told I met the production of over 40% which is required after training but I needed 2 days additional training in a couple of areas. After the additional training, I was told that I improved in those areas but had lifted with my back instead of my knees for one set of items. At the end of the shift, the trainers told me I would be contacted the following week to find out if I would be starting work there or if I would be better suited to work at one of the stores. I waited the entire week for a phone call but never received it. I left a message for Human Resources but never received a return call.

Great People & Poor Policies,"Almost a decade with the company and recently it has truly taken a turn for the worst. The company once thrived on promotion, fairness, integrity and putting associates first. That is absolutely no longer the case. Walmart wouldn't be what it is today without the people who run each part of the business, who make the successes possible.

"The tasks are simple and easy, but there is poor organization, guidance, and scheduling from management.","As a cart pusher, I found my tasks to be pretty straightforward and simple. You retrieve carts from the lot and return them to the bay, keeping with the flow of business. You would help customers with carryouts loading and lifting heavy objects and other physically demanding tasks.For the most part, you have a lot of freedom and independence working outside, it is can be just you or a small crew. you are allowed to take small breaks due to the physical workloads and weather conditions. On slow days, it can sometimes be a very relaxed and great work environment. Management would often not get tied up in how you do your job, only that you do your job. However, this where it becomes a major problem when you are short staffed and operating on a skeleton crew. On busy days, this is especially problematic as you can't keep up with the flow of business and management is unresponsive to not only feedback from their employees but of customers as well. It makes performing what is asked of you that much more stressful and difficult.Another problem is poor and inconsistent scheduling, there were months where hours would be cut to as low as 10 hours a week and months where I'd be working close to full-time due to short staffing.For the effort that many employees put in, especially in my position, the pay could be much better and the bonuses more frequent. There also needs to be more effort put in acknowledging the feedback employees give when the job gets difficult to do.Overall, my experience at walmart has been negative.

"Good people, bad experiences","The team I worked with was amazing and was honestly the only reason I came into work. The work was tedious, though easy. I advanced a bit, but was rarely compensated for the advancements. The management was fairly nice at my location and worked with me on my schedule when I had health issues.

People will turn on you in an instant if they have reason to. My advice; do the job, collect your paycheck, and go home. Often, I've heard people complain that my specific line of work is ""tough"". I would describe this as a job for the independent. Walmart promotes itself with a teamwork mentality. Yet, I feel that it is only those who keep to themselves and learn how to function independently are the ones that survive. Learn as much as you can from those around you but do not cling to them.

Leadership in Bentonville seems out of touch with reality and is painfully slow to adapt to changes. Teams take forever to come to consensus for even small initiatives and politics is rampant across most teams/orgs at Walmart.

"(Overnight) Your coworkers are your enemies, and management oversees the coliseum.","Working for Walmart is a drag.First off, we will go over what the job is, and what gets in the way of it.As a night stocker, your job is purely speed and accuracy of stocking. Or at least, this is what the managers will tell you. Realistically, it also involves cleaning up the shelves as you go. But if you take the time to do this, even if you are fast, you will fall behind the least among you. I typically work in the same area every day. I am either the first or second fastest person in this area after 3 months. The only person I can honestly say is as fast is someone who has been there for years.The two primary hiccups you will run into while stocking are products misplaced by customers, which isn't a huge deal, and entire cases of product stocked in the wrong location. And this also isn't a big deal but what you'll come to find is 90% of the workers do not correct these issues. And so what happens is more product will start stacking up in the wrong location, but the system will keep ordering more because it thinks the stuff is flying off the shelves and human error is afoot. I like to play a game, when you find something stocked in the wrong place, and follow it to it's proper location, you will often find another thing stocked in the wrong place, and another, and another. After you've wasted about 20 minutes fixing it you certainly do get some sense of accomplishment before having to do it again 2 days later.Next obstacle you will face are series of laziness usually left behind by other shifts. There is no consistency to where equipment is left. You will find printers - more...",2,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker Associate ,"Appleton, WI",12/12/21,2021,12,12

"Flexible hours, with good pay. Terrible management, feeling stressed out.","This is a good place to work place if you enjoy a fast paced environment. This was a tough first job because my manager was almost never around, and the amount of tasks was insurmountable. I was 16 when I got hired and they had me pulling 2000 lb pallets full of frozen/dairy products. I worked in the fridge. On the days I worked alone (which was a lot) I had to carry the whole dairy department and while I’m struggling with that they might even tell me to do returns. On busy days that is impossible. The management is never around to support you, it took me 2 months to even partially learn what I was doing because of this. If they hired more people in this department it would be better. Some management in the store are rude and make it seem like they do not care about you. They treat you good at first but it goes downhill. They don’t tell you if they fire you because they say “they aren’t required to”. I don’t know if that is legally ok but it is something I wanted to throw out there.

Pay has increased but company advancement is about who you know.,"I’ve worked at Walmart on two different occasions, for a total of 10 years. I’ve learned that to move up the ladder in Walmart it is about who you know and how they feel about you. It took me a total of seven years the first time to make $11 dollars that was through promotions and raises. The second time I started at only 11 and left close to that same number. I’ve seen signs that start at $15 now. Still not nearly enough but better. Management can be unsupportive then complain when your work isn’t done, and not realize that they pulled you from your department and that’s why it isn’t finished. It all depends on what location you get, a lot of issues stem from being controlled by people who haven’t/never worked in the actual store with customers but tell you how to do your job…corporate, plus horrible upper management equals disaster.",3,Former Employee,PHOTO LAB ASSOCIATE ,"Troy, MO",12/10/21,2021,12,10

Pretty decent workplace especially if you have chill people to work with. Had a small basketball shooter and tv in break room.,I worked as a Cap 2 associate which was just unloading freight from truck onto pallets and stocking shelves. Overall It was pretty chill unless you are short staffed then you have to pick up the pace since you have two hours to unload a truck. Stocking is pretty easy since you can go at your own pace. The hardest places to stock in my opinion is dog food and drinks (water/juice/etc) which was what I was always doing. Once others are done working there section you do get help later so it’s not too bad unless you have bad managers who are uptight. My managers were pretty chill and even helped if things were backed up. ,3,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Albuquerque, NM",12/10/21,2021,12,10
Great pay / benefits. Typical retail structure.,"Overall, the company is a great place to work with good benefits. I feel like your satisfaction in this workplace is largely dependent on your management team. I have had absolutely wonderful managers that brought out the best in me, and I've had managers that made me question how they even have their position. The company's schedules are aligned with their business needs, and sometimes that doesn't work with what employee's need.  Although I worked at this company for 12+ years (and loved my job, crew, and challenges), I felt like it was not a place for a single parent to work. It's almost impossible to get a promotion and keep a schedule that aligns with the school schedule - attendance policy can also be a Challege for a single mother with no support system. I also feel like they have a disposable culture, as everything is designed so anybody could take your spot tomorrow.  Being a cooperation, there are always new changes being implemented. Although the MAJORITY are there to make your job easier and more efficient, there are some that are counterproductive. I don't feel like this company values their long-term employees.",4,Current Employee,Entertainment Team Lead ,Missouri,12/10/21,2021,12,10

Sweet person who was taken advantage of and told that having overtime would ""Help buy that new 70inch T.V."" this person has been working for Walmart for years and didn't even know about the 401k program, let alone that they didn't have to come in on their days off when I spoke with them on occasion.",2,Former Employee,Asset Protection Specialist ,"Superior, WI",12/10/21,2021,12,10

"Easy job, bad work environment. ",It's a decent paying job. The work itself is easy. Don't expect to get promoted unless you are someone's favorite or kiss up to advance. Hard workers don't get rewarded. The point system is unbalanced. Most stress comes from other coworkers not doing thier job and nothing being done about it. Management is terrible. Too often they make decisions based off emotions and not professionalism. Don't expect to get a raise. Dress code is pretty chill tho. ,2,Current Employee,Associate ,"Farmville, VA",12/10/21,2021,12,10

"The Good, The Bad, and...The Surprising?","THE GOOD: The People - Most of the people I worked with and a surprising number of the customers went a long way towards making the job worthwhile.The Pay - For this area of the country, taking into account that I was full time, I made pretty good money.THE BAD:Management - I do not mean all of them. We had some great ones. We also had horrid ones. Most of them were just trying to get through the day as best they could. Unfortunately, that tended to cause an attitude of looking out for number one. So they took what they saw in the moment and jumped to erroneous conclusions. Having said that, at least twice, I probably should have been coached for mouthing off to a manager (I confess to having a quick temper). But, he descalated the situation and everything was ok. But, I have come to this conclusion about Walmart: your management team can go a long way towards making or breaking your employment experience.Corporate - The other thing that really rankled was corporate. They wanted us to put the customer first, then they kept putting in policies that took us away from being able to help the customers. They also cut staff and hours to the point that it was almost impossible to do the things they wanted done. Then they would do everything they could to cheat you out of bonuses. It's almost like they were in an adverserial relationship with the workers rather than a symbiotic one.THE SURPRISING: The most surprising thing is that while I worked there, I found out that I really enjoyed helping the customers and even building relationships with them. I did not expect that.",3,Former Employee,Connection Center Associate ,"Louisa, KY",12/10/21,2021,12,10

"Manageable work, with some unmanageable coworkers ","I work in lawn and garden/seasonal. I enjoy the job and the work isn’t too hard. During the summer, when the outside patio is open, it requires acting as a cashier outside. All year round, we stock merchandise in the store and zone (straighten up) our department. The work isn’t hard and because it isn’t solely a stocking position the requirements aren’t extreme, especially with the few staff in the lawn and garden department. Some of the managers could be more supportive. Coworkers could also be more friendly and willing to help. I’ve ran into a few instances where I need help lifting a grill or where customer assistance is needed in an area of the store that I wasn’t trained to know and associates give me a hard time about helping the customer. It is kind of frustrating, but overall okay. ",3,Current Employee,Seasonal Sales Associate ,"Saint Clair, PA",12/10/21,2021,12,10

"Job security, no compassion for family life","Job security if you work for Walmart. But, Walmart expects you to be available around the clock for whenever they feel like scheduling you. One day you could be scheduled to open and the next day to close.. They have no compassion for home life, holidays and family life. Holidays are only for them to make extra money; nothing else. But, as long as you show up everyday and be on time you will have job security. They won't fire you if you are no good at your job. They will just ask you to move to a different department.

Good pay Bad Work Environment,"I would say, that I use to work for one of the best Walmarts around. Great people, great managers. work was hard, but co-wokers made it better. Then the restructure happened and everything just fell apart. More work, less people, no one seemed to really know what was going on. Waited it out, thinking it was growing pains. It only got worse. Long story short, if you need money and pretty good benefits, apply for a job. if you don't mind being shuffled around everywhere and expected to do way more than you should, apply. If you have no life, and enjoy having all your time owned by a company, apply. If you actually care about a job and always try to give it your all, do NOT apply.

The rumors are true…,Everything you’ve read about working at Walmart is pretty much true. Each manager has their own agenda and will manipulate you to achieve it. Management is also usually out to get each other as well as you. Self preservation through trying to get their coworkers fired.  People are hired and fired so often I give up learning their names or trying to teach them. Special treatment for a chosen few. Management will take 3 or 4 vacations a year and then get upset when you take a night off. The levels of laziness literally know no bounds here. The rules change on a weekly basis and that is NOT an exaggeration. Pretty sure the job is making me dumber. Probably should just stay away. ,2,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Granville, WV",12/9/21,2021,12,9

Management had unrealistic workload expectations on a daily basis and it seemed no matter how hard our team worked, we were yelled at for not working enough daily. Not worth it when you're not paid enough to feed yourself. What DID make this job worth it, was the people. Because of these situations, our crew was very close knit, and took care of each other.

Good opportunity if youre lucky.,"Walmart gets 3 stars as an overall employer because it is solely based on the leadership you are under. I've had amazing managers that make working fun and allow you to take pride and others that have made it a nightmare to go in every day. The pay is great and the work is demanding emotionally more than physically and luck tends to be a bigger promotional qualification than anything else. But the sky is the limit if you are patient and a good talker. But the bad times can be almost intolerable when you have poor management above you. Being a salary manager has a terrible work life balance. You are automatically scheduled for 50 hours per week and rarely will you only work 50 and will be expected to be available any day at any time and expected to always stay as late as you are ""needed"".

Walmart Supply Chain is a blackhole for your future.,"I have worked for Walmart Supply Chain for over 15 years. So here is my review in a nutshell. Leadership is lost and is struggling to keep up with the draconian managment from Bentonville. The company overall is in a death spiral of constant change that moves no needles whatsoever but constantly shrinks the workforce so someone in cubical can say they improved something and saved a dime on it. Site leadership is directed to reduce operating costs to the point where Chick-Fil-A is your holiday dinner each year. At this point in the game the company has officially rolled out automation of shipping loading and receiving unloading functions. The PR is that there will be better tech jobs from automation. No one believes this corporate PR stuff at all, and the hourly workers all know that job cuts are on the way in one form or another.  If you are desperate for a job Walmart Supply Chain might work for a bit but don't stay unless you have to. In my last building we had 3 general managers in 5 years with a life expectancy of about 20 months each.",1,Current Employee,Associate ,Associate,12/8/21,2021,12,8

",3,Former Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Gulf Breeze, FL",12/7/21,2021,12,7
The worst job I ever had,Managers don't care about you Policies don't apply to everybody only to those that they don't like. They would not give you the proper training just to see you Struggle!  I will not recommend Walmart to anybody,1,Current Employee,Stocking TA ,"Las Vegas, NV",12/7/21,2021,12,7
Apply only if desperate.,"This can be a wonderful job, however, the seasonal work makes this job not worth it. It's stressful on all levels for everyone and the workplace becomes tense. Mistakes happen that usually have nothing to do with you like the plumber busting a pipe in the men's bathroom and you need to keep the flow of water from escaping the bathroom by mopping up water for three hours.",3,Former Employee,Walmart customer service ,"San Antonio, TX",12/7/21,2021,12,7

It's what you make of it,You learn a lot but you're definitely expected to hit the ground running. Management can either be the worst or the best and that really decides how your whole working experience goes. Sometimes it's really stressful but sometimes it's not that bad. ,3,Current Employee,Online Grocery Associate ,"Denver, NC",12/7/21,2021,12,7
Great Starter Job But Not Long Term,The work is hard (if you do what you are supposed to) and the pay is okay.  They do not reward you for hard work or for being loyal to the company.  They have okay benefits that start at 90 days. ,3,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Bolivar, MO",12/7/21,2021,12,7
The gratitude from the people ,"They are people orientated, but their salaries are under par, compared too the companies retail statis in the  world.

Management will typically give leadership positions to other workers without pay or benefits.,Terrible. Management typically is uninvolved and many associates are lazy and unpunished. Management makes empty threats and employs unsavory individuals to say the least.,3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Clarksville, TN",12/7/21,2021,12,7
Alright Job,Walmart is definitely an ALRIGHT company that offers and ALRIGHT pay for employees. Managers are usually more concerned with productivity and not necessarily employees needs. ,3,Former Employee,Personal Shopper/Sales Associate ,"Winston-Salem, NC",12/7/21,2021,12,7

"Productive, but definitely over worked ","What I’ve learned coming back to Walmart is that they can, and will trap you if you make points. I recently tried to transfer to a closer Walmart because I travel nearly an hour to get to my current one, and they would not let me transfer. The system they’ve established does not care about hard working employees. Very disappointed ",2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Overnight Stocker ,"Turkey Creek, TN",12/7/21,2021,12,7
Horrible managers and supervisors,Obviously it depends on which store you work at but my store had horrible workers and bosses that just had zero respect. All the management seemed to be hired because they personally knew the store manager.HR also takes ages to process any requests,2,Former Employee,Front End Service Associate ,"Covina, CA",12/7/21,2021,12,7

Good While it lasted,"I started working there a few months ago to leave my other job and the origination was quick but thorough. The work environment was alright, I really LOVED the large and chill break room. I got along with my co workers and Management pretty well, I was never disrespected or yelled at by staff. The point system I think they have is fair but they let me go for personal reasons I couldn't control. They are unfortunately pretty understaffed and its always busy around 12pm, Running out of change is pretty common. You need another persons register numbers or a manger to do any function like open the register or cancel a transaction. Trying to contact the Schuduling manager is nearly impossible. They said you get a 10% discount card after 3 months (90 days) but they fired me before I could get one.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bellingham, WA",12/7/21,2021,12,7

Some walmarts poorly managed in past,"Worked for several different walmarts. Some had decent management, some others had very poor management who talked about their employees and picked favorites to support in growth. It's one of the best paying employers walking in the door now, but employees who spent years building up their hourly rate aren't reaping any benefit from that when new people walk in the door making what it took you 7 or more years to achieve. The people that spent all that time building that pay should have gotten more than matching what people walk in making. Many jobs were cut so that more responsibility could be put on fewer people.",3,Former Employee,"AP, online grocery, deli, cuatomer service ",Lenoir,12/7/21,2021,12,7

Walmart owns your soul ,Walmart has great benefits and pay. But they do a lot of mandatory OT( the do offer bonus here and there). The main problem is that you accumulate Protect paid time so slowly it’ll be 6 months in till your able to take even one day off without getting a point. So it’s hard. Also people like to try and boss you around and ACT like a supervisor or Lead when they are literally the same position as you. I don’t like that. ,3,Current Employee,SSTK/ Forklift Operator ,"Apple Valley, CA",12/7/21,2021,12,7

walmart sucks!,Workers are kept at part time so that that the company can avoid giving them benefits reserved for full time employees. Many employees are forced onto public assistance just to make ends meet because they can not get enough hours of work to support themselves.. That's correct; walmart uses the Amercan taxpayer to supplement their employees dismal wages. Walmart is a malignant retail cancer.,2,Former Employee,Deli Counter Clerk ,"Tucson, AZ",12/6/21,2021,12,6

Depressing,Management was a messy that never knew what was going on. The manager in the deli I worked in never liked to help out when things got busy and coworkers called in. A bit of times I would have to work by myself in the deli. Very low pay with a lot work duties.,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Deli Clerk ,"Appleton, WI",12/6/21,2021,12,6

Horrible,"This place is a nightmare.  Managers quit just as often as employees do.  Toxic work environment.  Store is dirty and not a priority, only care about getting inventory on shelves.

Very slow on firing people who do nothing.",1,Former Employee,Team Leader/Supervisor ,"Howell, MI",12/6/21,2021,12,6
Poor training ,With better training this could be a great place to work . Weekend shift is 3  days  a week and which equals 12 days of training mostly alone after 2 weeks . Unable to request  days off you have to fill out a form at the beginning of the year and hope it gets approved . Mandatory  overtime on a completely  different shift while other departments work same shift times.  ,2,Former Employee,Forklift Driver ,"St. James, MO",12/6/21,2021,12,6

"Good Start, but Don't Stay","Walmart is a company where the experience varies from store to store. You'll never know what it's gonna be like until you start working. Even if you're part time, they're going to schedule you for full time hours and not offer you the benefits. So here's my recommendation: Work there for the experience but don't stay for the promotion. If you aren't a favorite of the store manager, you're not getting promoted regardless of what you do. I'm sorry but this is the sad reality.",3,Current Employee,Associate ,North Carolina,12/6/21,2021,12,6

"Auto tech at store 2567, former employee for over a year","Usually I am not one to take the time to write a review on something good or bad, however working at walmart is an experience that I have to share. I started off as a frozen dairy associate. Excelled in that postion and could of had leadership of becoming a department manager, this showed that I have the work ethic and that I cared about my job. Upon the auto center reopening I was offered a position out in the shop by the atm based off of my hard work ethic. I took the position looking for something new and a little pay raise was the sugar on top. From the get go of transferring to automotive, my  work ethic started going downhill. This was not due to the fact that management and the structure of the work environment is terrible.

No Advancement,"Walmart is really good at getting their workers excited for promotions then just giving it to someone else quick. They do not value their employees. They look at their employees as numbers. In my situation it took forever to fire an employee who was doing drugs in the back, always skipping, never showing up, taking 4 hour lunches, getting aggressive but if someone else were to be a minute late then their fired the second.

No room for growth,"when you're not busy, spend your time touching merchandise around the register because they'll yell at you for not looking busy. they'll gladly have you run around the store helping in other departments but when you ask for change in position or a promotion at best you'll get ""we'll see what happens"".",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"East Meadow, NY",12/5/21,2021,12,5

Not All Walmarts Are The Same,"I've considered transferring, yet, the one in Katy is the best. There are some people who make it harder for others, by not caring to work as a team. This, leaving the closing team to clean up even more, which is a real pain in the butt. This in turn, makes a huge difference in our (team's) overall moral. Definitely need more workers instead of pulling people from the store, to help offload product carrying trucks. The automotive techs are specially certified, yet get stopped from doing their job, to offload which leaves the workload for ACC even higher. The managers and supervisors are awesome and have done their best to help people out, by being as flexible as possible for personal needs. When it comes to Walmart benefits, READ! Because people don't use time to read enough, people don't realize how abundantly helpful Walmart benefits can provide. There are WAY MORE than just discounted prices and very cheap education costs. All-in-all, everything in life has its pros and cons. The weight is based on your experience, perspective, and ethics.",4,Former Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Katy, TX",12/5/21,2021,12,5

Fun place to work for a first job ,Love the environment. I spend fairly a year and a half and enjoyed every single day as a cashier. Managers where helpful and understanding whenever we had a hard time.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"La Habra, CA",12/4/21,2021,12,4
Poor management and favoritism ,Would not ever recommend working for this corporation because of poor management and lack of safety. When you get hurt there they will refuse to get you proper help and will just fire you instead of filing a claim. They do not care about their employees or their safety. They also lie about their insentive program and you do what is required and they rip you off. They give away PLE (power lifting equipment) licenses without doing test because they are to lazy to train. All in all this company is a joke to work for and very disrespectful to their employees. Salida Colorado Walmart is definitely not a place to try to make a career. Plus they lower your hire on Pay rate one week after you start. ,1,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Salida, CO",12/4/21,2021,12,4
If you can handle it,"It’s the high pay that ropes you in. They start you off easy and then depending on what time of year, you run the risk of getting overloaded. A lot of the time you’ll find that they’re understaffed, which sucks bc you might end up doing the job of 4 people on your own. Most customers are very sweet and understanding, but those few rude ones can make you consider quitting. Training was also a little spotty, and even though the staff is willing to help, they are so busy that they end up being impossible to find during crucial moments. You might learn things later than people hired after you, like I am. The staff is pretty nice and understanding can’t complain about them. It’s a sell your soul for money type of job, if you’re alright with that. ",3,Current Employee,Digital Personal Shopper ,"Centereach, NY",12/4/21,2021,12,4

Racism,"Ovoid working, assistants manager not qualified. Loosing time when  you work for  them.  Wiring for Walmart is a waste of time. I worked for Walmart for more than 4 years.

Great people and fun team environment ,It all depends on your store manager and senior leadership. I've had good and bad. You basically feed off of how they manage the team and associates whether it be out of simple fear of being coached or motivated to help you become successful.  In my opinion customer and associate focus should be more of a priority since those are two key things to keeping a successful buisness. ,4,Former Employee,Manager ,Texas,12/3/21,2021,12,3

You are a body and must follow commands.,They don't follow their own policies. The customer is always right by management even if they are wrong. Upper management does not have your back. Some team leads talk to you like you are dirt under their boots. They absolutely do not follow covid mandates.

"Good Pay, Terrible treatment","The job is doable. Just keep your head down and do your day to day tasks.

Poor leadership.,"By far one of the most noticable things was the poor leadership. Management/coaches were either not helping, getting on to us for the smallest things, or both at the same time.

Changed the schedules, and changed our duties countless times, then complained when we weren't familiar with the work.",3,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Canton, TX",12/2/21,2021,12,2

Revealing and learning experience,"While working for the Online Grocery Pick up department, I learned that very few people care about your well being and care about doing the work you can't do because you're out sick. Young people can work here, be disrespectful and slack off while others pick up the work for them and it drains you. When I came back from a week leave due to illness, I realized how inconsiderate everyone was and that very few people would share the work load and not even take initiative.

Poor management and impossibly high standards,"Terrible culture with lots of favoritism. The management team had members that were very strict with high expectations. The expectations were impossible to meet within one shift and with the staff we had. For example, they wanted everything in the notes done by early afternoon in addition to everything else that needed to be done store wide (stocking, zoning, etc). We were short staffed in many areas. Management cared more about metrics than the employees. Of course store performance is important but, so is the well-being of associates. I did enjoy working with most people at my store and getting to know them. ",3,Former Employee,Team Lead ,USA ,12/2/21,2021,12,2
Great Benefits. But unrealistic workload for management. ,"So, let me start off by saying in no way do I feel like Walmart is a bad place to work.

It's Walmart,"Since it's Walmart, you get what you expect quite frankly. I got fired over having exactly 5 points and was given no chance to explain or anything.

Ok if you have thick skin,"My co workers were great. They too nerd smiles and encouragement while dealing with impolite, rude, impatient and sometimes intolerable customers. Many Walmart associates are highly educated adults whom the world treats as doormats. This is one of the main reasons for the high turnover.

Management says they can't do anything to hire more people no matter how short staffed it gets and most shifts it seems like only a skeleton crew is around to run the day to day. Best thing about working here is the hour lunch break and that's because you don't have to be there.

"I have work there . They would rather have people who are not friendly, then who doesn't show up because of needing a ride or babysitter.

We worked in personal shopper, people we worked with  just sat on there phones, told management they didn't care! The job pays enough to cover bills but thats it! The point system is stupid. Especially for ones that has mental health issues!   8 have been told several different things when asking a question!  No one trains you to do the job, your just thrown in it!

"Flexible, Realistic, At Home Job for Moms/Parents","I work from home, (corporate/home office) they have a very generous and flexible system for allowing you to adjust your schedule as needed. The benefits are really good, they will pay for you to go to school, and have several online programs to help you further your education, there is paid Maternity, and paid parental leave for dads/ co-parent. And they also connect you to a ton of resources for free help. They actively promote having good mental health and provide free help for that as well. They are a very inclusive bunch, LGBTQ friendly, with a very accepting work culture. The managers are very supportive and upbeat, and provide a ton of great feedback to make sure you are staying on top of your work goals. They try to make work engaging and fun, and ask for lots of feedback. I enjoy the freebies they send you, and the company swag. This job requires lots of problem solving skills and remembering many policies and procedures as well as operating 10+ sites/applications at one time to perform the job tasks. Also have to be good with customers and have patience - everyone who you talk to is there because they have a problem. It also helps to disassociate and not take bad moods personally. The job is really rewarding when you fix the customer’s problem that they thought was a lost cause. More often it’s the latter experience.

Every day, be prepared to deal with rude customers of course. Something about Walmart simply attracts the worst people you could ever meet in your life.

Management told me they were gonna replenish the carts, but after 4 months of waiting patiently for new carts to come into my store,  I decided to move on and pursue another job because the stress of bringing insufficient amount of carts to the customers become to much.

They don’t care about you or respect what your availability is in the slightest.

Most Coworkers are great to work with but some upper management need improvement.,I loved my job as a department manager until the company decided to do away with the positions. There were no comparable positions at the time so I chose the severance option.,3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"New Philadelphia, OH 44663",11/28/21,2021,11,28

Walmart sucks,"They will work you til you drop, and when they realize you have a brain and could possibly advance (even though they dont even try to train anyone) they will either find a way to fire you or will make something up.

Great pay unrealistic expectations ,Had a good career each year has become harder and harder to get the work done. Going from department managers to team leads and coaches was horrible move. They reduced leadership in stores paid little more but not enough leadership. The company recently allowed to add more leaders but too late. Along with headcount the company says you need to run a store is not enough to get job done. This Christmas season we are getting more inventory than we can handle but upper management does not care. Several leaders are leaving company. ,3,Current Employee,Store Manager ,"Austin, TX",11/28/21,2021,11,28

It's fine,"Walmart hires just about anyone who can work, not a bad job overall. Pretty light with the amount of work you actually do compared to my previous job (warehouse worker). Management is the only down side honestly; big egos, down talking, micromanaging, playing favorites, ect. Depending on your region half of the associates won't speak English which makes team work and communication difficult. ",3,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"East Windsor, CT",11/28/21,2021,11,28

Walmart is an excellent place to work.  ,"They have good pay, Good equipment, Excellent offices personnel, great shop employees.

Good first job experience ,This was my first job and I feel like it was a good experience to have had. I believe everyone needs to work a customer service job at one point in their lives so they learn to appreciate the people that work in the service industry. Pay is basic and hours vary depending on things such as time of year and your area. Coworkers become like family.,5,Former Employee,Front End Services Team Associate ,"Clovis, CA",11/27/21,2021,11,27

There is opportunity for advancement but a challenging work environment ,When I started work at Walmart 16 years ago it was more of a family feel work place. As time has gone on it has moved more towards a corporate feel. There always seems to be more work then time there tends to be more on your plate then what can be accomplished in your work day. Which tends to leave you feeling frustrated and no matter how hard you work it's never quite good enough. ,2,Current Employee,Team lead Bakery/Deli ,Bakery/Deli,11/27/21,2021,11,27
If you need a job,"Wal-Mart’s got some of the poorest management skills I have ever seen in my life. From upper management changing rules/policies constantly, to team leads complaining about their jobs/out right not doing them because they have people to do it for them/being hypocrites/being understaffed CONSTANTLY, to receiving countless calls (to the point which could almost be considered harassment) when you call out of work (while using PPTO) because you’re sick, place is NOT a good place to work.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate/Stocker/Ecommerce ,"Asheboro, NC",11/27/21,2021,11,27
What you make of it,"It is what you make of it. You can move up easily if you work hard and Walmart prefers to hire its managers from in house. That being said, it has some cons. See below",4,Current Employee,O/N Stocker ,"Philadelphia, PA",11/27/21,2021,11,27
Fine for a short amount of time,"It was just a boring little job to do that you don't have to think at all. There was not much guidance, just kind of threw me out onto the floor and told me to unload carts and that is about it. I could not stay, it was killing me not to have my mind challenged. If your looking for something short term that's not hard what so ever than maybe consider it. I didn't really interact with my coworkers but they were nice enough, just a little dull.",3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Pendleton, OR",11/27/21,2021,11,27
Poror management,Poor management & not much of a fair working environment. Managers use people who they favor to help level up. Some people never get the correct training & support to grow within the company.,2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,Georgia,11/27/21,2021,11,27

Horrible place to work,"Almost all the training is irrelevant to the position I applied for. There seems to be a lack of order in the workplace. I was supposed to be a cart pusher but workers had me stocking and doing things outside of my position at times. This slowed me down with my work. A supervisor and co worker yelled at me which is unprofessional. Usually, I was the only one pushing carts from the whole parking lot everyday. It was unrealistic to expect me to get it all done by the end of my shift. I couldn't access the schedule or training from home to help me. I had to log in from Walmart to do it. I was told I had to check to see if my schedule changed. I couldn't constantly keep checking my schedule for changes as I had to work. By the end of my shift, I'm tired, hungry, and just want to go home. You're only allowed three absences excused or unexcused before you're fired. Horrible system. No wonder why many of my co workers left after me. Don't work here. ",2,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Apex, NC",11/27/21,2021,11,27
It’s a okay job,"Working at Walmart it’s fun , you get to meet new people, if you a type of person that great with team work , you will love this job. The pay is that all that. They can do better.

Confused and complicated ,To many “managers” including employees that had been there a while that acted as such.

"Great coworkers, terrible management",Not enough workers are hired for what Walmart requires the workers to do.

Not a very fun workplace but can be a consistent source of kiney,"The management has very terrible favoritism, some employees get to free Willy others they are strict about.

Need to respect long time workers more,"After 11 years I am only making as much as an entry level employee, and am not the only one. Walmart claims it pays $15+ an hour, but the reality is that they start at far less and raises are lost when they decide to restructure or change positions. In most evaluations, they will find something to rate as a needs improvement in order to keep your raise, if any, low. Also we used to get quarterly bonuses, but that was removed at the beginning of 2021.I have seen more people step down, than up.",2,Current Employee,PERSONAL SHOPPER/ ASSOCIATE ,"Fort Wayne, IN",11/26/21,2021,11,26
Meh,It's a job that will give you 40 hours and okay pay for what you do. The only real downside is management but if you can ignore them it's not that bad.

No real growth anymore ever since they made a shift with management.,3,Current Employee,Fresh Cap 1 Associate ,"East Windsor, CT",11/26/21,2021,11,26
Fair pay. People are subjective ,I was fortunate to get in with a good crew. It’s really subjective to how well you get along with others. Some discrimination goes on as Walmart doesn’t like to take care of their elders as well. Benefits are good of you fit in their standards. Equipment was good and they try to make pay as fair as possible. ,4,Current Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Havelock, NC",11/26/21,2021,11,26

A continuous downward spiral,"starting in 2020 right at the peak of the pandemic the job was fun but its not devolved into a mess with no communication and abusive behavior. Management only care about themselves and maximizing their bonus(which Walmart has taken out for all regular associates) meaning they work you down to the bone for only their benefit. Management very rarely is out on the floor doing anything that isn't yelling at associates for not doing the job fast enough, its a disgrace. Most of the time you'll see leads and the store manager sitting in the offices laughing and doing nothing while cashiers are swamped with mile long lines.

Management is all over the place; there are those who are extremely helpful while others don't know what they are doing. Your co-workers are mostly positive and willing to help.

Horrible company,"Don't work here unless you like being treated bad and being undertrained, poorly paid, poorly managed and constantly overworked because the turnover rate is so high. Also expect that they will promise you full time and then short you whole weeks on your schedule. Have never been lied to and treated as poorly as this company did. Also wasn't onboarded properly, given any cbls and very little training. Was not issued proper equipment that was standard and usually given by Walmart for the job. I think management was so stressed from so many quitting that they didn't care. Was not given proper orientation because there was no one available at my store to do it and had to go to a store across town where they were overcrowded and unsure of my stores procedures. Employees are miserable, very little team work, its an everyman for himself kind of environment. There is so much more.

The turnover rate is awful and to many call out so we’re always short handed. The managers get mad that you can’t be everywhere at once then won’t do anything to help you. You have to help do other peoples jobs most of the time. It’s mostly the older aged people who start the drama, they get away with everything. Your health benefits and sedgwick for leave of absences are a joke. They barely cover anything and sedgwick is a hassle. The point system doesn’t apply to the managers favorites.

All Walmart cares about really is the almighty dollar they don't really care about their people at all especially management.  A ring for Change and they hardly ever come till you're completely out response time is atrocious,1,Former Employee,Customer service cashier ,"Winnemucca, NV",11/21/21,2021,11,21
It’s just what you make it ,I worked here for a little while and I asked for part time and they ended up working me full time with no work/life balance. They can sometimes make you do other peoples jobs and being a cashier the customers can be particular with how they want their items bagged and etc. ,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Georgia, VT",11/21/21,2021,11,21
Okay place to work ,My experience here was not the best. Management expects you to bend over and do flips for the very little pay that you are compensated. Management was one things now the customers/ guest is a whole other experience.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Mansfield, TX",11/21/21,2021,11,21
good place to work ,the pay is good the equipment is good they get u home when u r suppose to be very family oriented if u hav a kid in sports and u wanna make a game they will do there best to get u a load that way the only problem is the slip seating that sucks i wish thy wud get everyone there own truck,4,Former Employee,Truck Driver Class A ,"Spring Valley, IL",11/21/21,2021,11,21
"Walmart e-commerce,  prepare for no family life.","Management is severely underpaid and they require you to work 6 days 12 hour days . The hourly associates make more than Management annually, if they do 6 days with OT.  You also work Thanksgiving and Christmas day. E-commerce is a terrible place to work if you value family life.",3,Current Employee,Area Manager ,"Fort Worth, TX",11/21/21,2021,11,21
A good starter job,It always depends on the management you have. You can have a great experience here or you can have an awful one. The easiest position i would probablly say is the cashier. From what i have experienced cashiers are the happiest employees there. At the time minimum wage was 8.75 and i was making 10 just starting there with no experience. ,2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Romeoville, IL",11/21/21,2021,11,21
Fast-pace and somewhat toxic,"I've have alot to see in the few months I've been here. A couple of friendly and helpful people but what I can say is there is lots of favoritism, management are debatable. They're rude towards other areas in the store. At the moment they're so short staffed that you will not for sure work in the position you get. They don't care about your weekends, say goodbye to them .

It's a good place to start working,"At the Walmart I'm working right now, honestly, it's not that bad. I work for the Online Grocery Pick Up department part-time, not bad at all, just have to deal with customers when they don't understand the process of their orders being made.

Doesn’t really work with schedule ,When I worked here I was also enrolled in school. I needed more time to stay so I attempted to only make it in my schedule where I only worked 4 days out the week but HR refuse to update my availability and kept putting it off,2,Current Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Columbia, SC",11/21/21,2021,11,21
Not a bad place to work,"Overall it's a good place to work. The benefits aren't bad and the pay is a step above other companies with similar roles. Like with any company management can be hit or miss, where I worked they were all professional and even if you missed some days for the unexpectedly both the management and your co-workers were understanding, don't make a habit of it though haha. All in all it's a simple role with decent pay and benefits with room for both vertical(moving up in the company) and lateral(switching roles at the same level/pay). However if your the one unloading the truck your expected to move fast and if your not tall there's no stepping stool for you so boxes will fall either on you or floor on occasion, which isn't safe. Management does want the truck empty at a set time and on one occasion  reprimanded some of my co-workers, it was my day off and others clocked out as well so there weren't enough people to unload, when they went over the set timeframe for the truck to be unloaded. Wasn't management's finest hour but they're usually not bad, in my experience.I'm typing a whole book over here haha.",5,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Brockton, MA",11/21/21,2021,11,21
Exhausting and not worth it,It killed me from the inside out. I didnt feel like I had a life outside of work and they ignored what I needed and what I asked of them before starting. I was lied to pushed around. Few checks were short because they took too long to put me back in the system. I was part time but had full time hours.i asked for morning/ day and got 3rd shift. ,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Kenosha, WI",11/21/21,2021,11,21

"Decent enough job, bad management and too many employees that don't actually work.","Management will purposefully make you do things you've made clear you don't enjoy. Everyone except a select few stands around. There's about 30 people but only 10 of them are worth anything. You'll be working outside a lot.

Was good at the beginning ,My job was ok in the beginning I was getting good hours and everything was fine. Then as I proceeded to work their there was a switch. Everyone there was constant gossipers especially both of the managers in the front end. Also a lot of favoritism their especially with the amount of hours you get. After about a year of being a cashier they offered me a position in the online grocery pickup department I thought it was going to be good since they pay you about $2 more. You will not compensate for the amount of work you in put in. The manger didn’t really know how to manage all the things going on and she would get really stressed out and take it out on the team.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Vero Beach, FL",11/20/21,2021,11,20

Semi-Productive & stressful workplace,"The store manager stresses you out daily with doing tasks that are not part of the procedure for One Best Way.

Great short term place to work,"As a short term solution, it is a great place to work. However, long term can cause quick burn out.

Unfortunately, you are not cared for on a personal level no matter how much effort went into the output that you produce. ",5,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Kansas City, MO",11/20/21,2021,11,20
Chance for career advancement but No down time,"Walmart has been my place of employment for 9 years now. I have excelled and promoted within the company numerous of times. The opportunity for raises each year,  401k matching, stock purchasing options, and bonuses really kept me inspired throughout the years. This has unfortunately, come to an end. Many associates are not eligible for bonuses or raises anymore under the new base pay and role payment caps. The company is focused on attaining more salaried members of management. Could this be good for the company? Yes, maybe getting new people in the door will change some of the things homeoffice has going on? I’m not sure but I’m not interested. They call you in when they want, you can’t enjoy your off time.

Decent job for the pay,"I have worked every hourly waged position here and I have to say sales associates (especially the general merchandise side) is the easiest going. Talking with customers, mixing paint, cutting fabric, stocking. it's not as strenuous as the back room and not as demanding as the front end. I always had time to go on scheduled breaks and was never too busy to help a customer look for an item. The downside is everyone (managers, coworkers, customers) always walk the store looking for you to help because they think you have it so 'easy' so look forward to stocking groceries, backing up cashier duties, and covering every other department's lunch breaks WITHOUT the additional pay raise.

Job security ,"Walmart is an ever changing company always looking to improve profits and decrease overhead (employees are overhead). Roles change with expectations of doing more with less staff.

The expectations are high and sometimes unobtainable. There is not always appropriate staffing, which can affect our ability to serve customers, resulting in angry customers.

They tend not to fire anyone for anything except attendance and theft. Management will always put blame on you as it's passed down the ladder. The work you do is never enough, and the pay is bad if you aren't a Team Lead or higher. They will always try to over work you if they can, including attempting to make you do work that is against your job code. This has been the same in multiple locations I have worked at.

Bad management ,Management will throw you on the first day no training  expects you to stay over time every time you go in to work. Will be yelled at in front of customers when your no longer on the clock and going home. You'll work the job of five+ people in one shift and still be told your not doing enough not fast enough despite your work. Their expectations are so high its unrealistic you might as well skip all your breaks and never try to leave because you'll get in trouble for doing what your told it the you'll be dammed if you do and dammed if you don't with Management threatening you or saying/doing anything to keep you there longer then your aviability says because they don't respect you or your personal life ,2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Junction City, KS",11/16/21,2021,11,16
"Easy job, but don't make it your career.","Easy work that anyone can do, but if you strive for anything in life it will make you feel degraded after each work day due to being treated as a sub-human and essentially a nobody by management. Working hard has no merit because it is not recognized, and you have to have a strong sense of duty in order to work harder than the next guy who is taking it easy collecting the same paycheck (sometimes more depending on seniority) that you are. Management doesn't care about you even if they act like they do (it's their job after all). All they want are results with unrealistic expectations of what can and can't be done. Put them in the same position and they would definitely do worse or just as ""bad"" as you.Colleagues are a hit or miss and depends on you. While I was friendly with everyone, I could never hit it off with anybody due to me being middle-aged - those who were older were miserable there and mostly just wanted to work and be done with no interactions; those who were younger were just not people I could relate to at all since bless them - they were young'uns who were still interested in talking about middle school topics (how nice of a rack/rear a customer has and whether I would ""hit"" it etc).",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Honolulu, HI",11/16/21,2021,11,16

Big Company with opportunity,Walmart has something for everyone and every skill level.  If you just want to go to work and do the minimum you can.  If you want to advance through the company you can work hard and do that.  The benefits are pretty good.  I have worked there for 23 years so it must not be all bad.,4,Current Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Wake Forest, NC",11/16/21,2021,11,16
It's a job,"Overall, working at Walmart isn't entirely bad. The starting pay is decent and they have some cool benefits. You get an employee discount for everything in the store, except for groceries. (Kind of a bummer but, hey at least you get a discount!) It is very hard to get a full 40 hr. schedule unless you're management, and the only way I've found to get overtime is taking a 30 min. lunch instead of the full hour.

Fun ,it is a fun place to work and pay is fair for the level of work. extremely easy but if you want to advance its not about what you know but who you know. the work is easy but during holidays and inventory it can be too much. asked to do overtime but next thing you know you have to cut it. the people make the job fun and there are cool managers but there are some bad ones also. make sure you get a shift with good workers or the whole team aspect goes out the window. overall a very good and fun place to work. ,5,Former Employee,Cap team 2/Food/Fresh associate Department manager ,"Richmond, VA",11/16/21,2021,11,16
drama,some department heads will block you from moving forward. Also co workers can be great or not so great. Its great if you can find something to like about the place. Fellow associates made it great. You must be able to lift..at least 50lbs at a time. And be able to break down pallets of produce. They stack them at least 7 ft high.. manually pull pallets with a pallet jack,3,Former Employee,Associate ,produce,11/16/21,2021,11,16
I feel like I was cheated a little bit.,I worked at walmart and I absolutely loved it. From working in the garden to helping elder people take things to their cars I loved it all. But I was fired for a reason that I don’t know. There were a couple days where I couldn’t make it in to work due to personal reasons so I tried to call off by calling the sedgewick number but it redirected me to a different number every time! Using sedgewick you’re supposed to give them your pin number to call off but the number I called didn’t even ask for a pin number! I even told the managers that I couldn’t call off and they fired me anyways.

Work here Whither here,Bosses like to treat you like nobody. Roll their eyes and smirk comments. It's ridiculous the amount of immaturity from grown adults on a day to day basis. If you work in front end you suffer with customers who feel entitled and just plain rude. Work life and atmosphere is altogether enough to make you feel sick and tired burned out. No changes in the job culture no matter how well the benefits are it just doesn't make up for the lack the company needs to make up for.

Part time associate # of scheduled work hours disappointing,"Am going into my 3rd year as a part time associate. All my efforts to become a fulltime employee have been in vain.  My hours have been cut by half as my People Lead tries to force me into a frontend cash register position, saying that is the only way I can be given more hours. Because my average hours have been so low, I will lose my health benefits at the end of this year.  This is a very big deal.  And, even though the holiday season is in full swing, I'm being told by my People Lead that only fulltime employees will be offered more hours.  On onewalmart.com, corporate says that they are hiring more temporary employees for the holiday season and some of them will be offered fulltime jobs.

Some things to know: First, the management is hit or miss. Some managers are OK, some I could even consider friends! But others are micromanaging jerks. In fact I’d say micromanagement is encouraged and rewarded within Walmart.Second, having a work/life balance there is hard. I’ve had to fight for decent hours by filling out a form telling HR when I’m available and by transferring departments (which you can do every six months). The work is often stressful and tiring.Third, work hard and do your tasks as best you can. Learn your store and learn new tasks. Management will like you for it and more importantly, the customers will. But also establish boundaries. You don’t have to accept every special assignment management wants to give you. In fact, if you’re feeling spread thin (and you will) respectfully decline. Don’t give Walmart any more of yourself than you have to.I’m thoroughly disillusioned about Walmart.

Not the best overall.,Walmart was very accommodating with my college schedule and I didn't mind working there for the first two years. Once management of the store changed we were down four people in my department and they refused to hire any more people.

No integrity,"Permanently understaffed, even before covid. Too many members of management aren’t on the same page. And you feel like a child being yanked back and forth between feuding parents. Nothing is ever good enough. There is no incentive to do better, and no reward for any work above the bar they set to have a job there. Just lots of gimmicky subtle manipulation to make you think you’re getting something out of it, which works all too well on younger workers. Anyone in hourly management is being set up to fail, and salaried management only cares about their insane annual bonus. Everything is a number and you are expendable. If you want to feel like a human being and that what you do matters, just look somewhere else.",1,Current Employee,Team Associate ,"Easley, SC",11/11/21,2021,11,11
Time flexibility and better pay,"Attendance policy is terrible if you miss 5 full days over a 6 month period you are subject to termination, unless you request a leave of absence. Schedules are difficult to change and take 3 weeks to process and  apply to your work week. The pay isn't comparable to other online fulfillment positions at other companies, and the managers ""request"" that you take a 1/2 hour lunch. Also, they stress speed, but expect you to take the time to find items, which tends to slow you down.Great co workers and coach, but the team leads could use some professional training and  basic manners....PLEASE AND THANK YOU go a long way!",4,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Rockton, IL",11/11/21,2021,11,11

"Most co-workers are nice and easy to get along with, pay is decent, management can be okay depending on who's working.","While I enjoy meeting new people everyday, have some decent coworkers, and make decent money, management and work culture could definitely use work. Depending on which supervisors are working, things either run smoothly, or are a total train wreck. Breaks and lunch are either given on time or an hour late, sometimes not at all for breaks. I've been denied bathroom breaks and have got in trouble for socializing with other coworkers that are also on break, and have been reprimanded for not being back at 15 minutes on the dot for breaks, even when I have to run cold items back, am putting away hangers or security tags, etc etc. Which technically shouldn't be counted towards a break. I've also been made to feel like I am replaceable at times and sometimes feel disrespected by management.

There's always something to do. You are constantly on your feet. ,WalMart offers great benefits and pay. Other than that there isn't anything really nice to say about the giant retailer. Our equipment is junk or is always missing. For a multi billion dollar company that's really sad that they can't provide its associates with the tools they need to properly do their jobs.

Not enough pay for front end services,"Walmart pays a lot for in store shoppers (about $15-17), but they should really give that high hourly rate to the cashiers/front end services, who receive $13 in my state. The amount of stress and complaints, even sometimes having to ignore demeaning/discriminatory comments made by customers is not nearly compensated enough. In my particular store, sometimes management tends to let front end run around like headless chickens with no real sense of direction - it really depends on what manager is coming in. Many associates switch to in store shopping for that high wage, leaving front end to be understaffed and insanely under appreciated. It really makes this position severely unenjoyable.",2,Current Employee,Front End Service Clerk ,"Humble, TX",11/10/21,2021,11,10

Decent place to gain some experience. Not a long term place.,"Maintenance Corporate Leadership is in shambles trying to reduce downtime throughout the network and still haven't learned to train their maintenance technicians. They are constantly implementing new changes that never last. Absolutely no follow through with anything they plan to benefit their employees or smooth out any current procedures. Very rarely afforded any raises once you have been capped off and if a raise does come, they usually take away something in return, like Holiday Pay or Quarterly Incentives, so you don't really get much of a raise in the end.",3,Former Employee,Maintenance Technician ,"Chino, CA",11/9/21,2021,11,9
"Poor local management, lack of support","A day at Walmart in my experience involved little work within your own department, either being called to help cashier, help throw truck, help with carts, or to zone (front & face) another department. This made a typical day at work feel generally stressful and unfulfilling, with very little time to work in your own area's backstock and help customers in an area you are familiar with. The overall work on a day when the store was properly staffed and you could take care of your own area was very enjoyable for me, and I enjoyed learning how to do more advanced tasks throughout the store, including outside of my area, as long as I got to work within my own area often. Walmart has a passable base culture, but a large portion of your experience comes down to the regional, market, and local management. For me, particularly local management was less-than-ideal, expecting associates to meet unrealistic deadlines and goals while being constantly understaffed. The hardest part of the job was very infrequently having the tools or coverage to stay on-process, but still being rebuked by management for being unable to follow the process. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was good coworkers (most of them), being able to help customers find products to fit their needs, and learning more about the processes and advanced tasks throughout the store.",2,Former Employee,Salesfloor/GM Associate ,"Monroe, WI",11/9/21,2021,11,9

A lot of work and poor management but great coworkers,"At Walmart, as an online grocery pickup associate, you were put under a lot of pressure to do a lot of work close to perfection in their small time frame or you were fired. No overtime pay. If you managed to get everything done, they sent you to do even more work not in your job description. The communication between management is terrible and the rate at which people left and got fired was crazy. Only work here if you don’t mind heavy work load and no regard for your worth from management. The only thing I loved was my coworkers and my hour lunch.

Only Work Here for the Free College,Do not work at Walmart! You will lose brain cells because people work off emotions rather than intellect.

I felt sick one day and they didn’t even let me leave early or i would have gotten written up. Your “co-worker friends” actually talk behind your back and talk about you to everyone if something happens or whatever.

You can definitely find better than here,"Now I have worked in different retail stores for 15 years and I have to say this place was probably the worst managed location I have worked at. I started as a temp (and became a full time employee a few months later) when the pandemic really started affecting everything early in 2020. When I first started they had plenty of people in all areas of the store, never really having to worry about being understaffed unless multiple people called in. Then the company decided to go back to overnights after they stopped doing it for a few years. That's when things went downhill. The overnight crew slacked off and never completed their job, blaming the truck being late or the truck being too big. At this point it was just me and the department manager trying our best to do the job of 5 people. I was promoted to a position like an assistant manager, which I appreciated and was grateful for, but if I would have known that the department manager and I would be treated so horribly because our best isn't good enough, then I wouldn't have taken the position. I know I can do the job if I had people to lead but they are so worried about making sure the Online Grocery Pickup had people. And half of them play around instead of work. I know because I'm friends with a couple of them on Snapchat and they always post something of them doing something they are not supposed to be doing. Its not difficult for the hiring manager to bring in new people to work in my department but it seems like its a hard task, especially when the hourly pay isn't fair.

It's a hand held scanning device used to look up customer orders, pick customer orders, price check and a bunch of other stuff... When I arrive at work I spend at least 45 minutes trying to find a TC. I hate it so much. I Ask the store manager who says no and sends me to someone else who doesn't have one, who sends me to ask someone else if they have one, it's awful.

If you wasn't in their click, then they would talk smack about you and made fun of you for being slow and they would even go as far as trying to get you into trouble with leadership for not knowing how to do your job correctly. From day one, it was a constant headache. They expected you to know what product, went on what pallets, when it came off the truck, they expected you to know how to stack a pallets correctly. They expected all of this WITH NO PROPER TRAINING!! This is why they can't keep people and their turn over rate is so high back there.

It's Walmart,"It is a pretty easy job that can be stressful at times. When working the front end, it is a lot of repetitive work. You're usually working as either a cashier or self check out host. Unless you are a service desk associate then you are dealing with financial services (money transfers, check cashing) and returns. Sometimes they will put you on the door for receipt checking if the greeters need a break or lunch. You will be on your feet for 8 hours a day. But you do get two 15 minute breaks and an one hour lunch. If you are working in an area with a good amount of associates, then they are flexible with your hours. Morning shifts are way better than evening shifts. But good luck trying to get a morning shift. The hardest parts about the job are dealing with the rude customers, lazy employees, and unhelpful managers.

On that note as well, the call in policy is awful. 4 occurrences within 6 months and they can fire you.Also because of staffing issues, your workload is huge. You can almost never finish the work assigned to you in your departments because you're frequently assigned 2-3 departments to zone and you end up with 2 carts of returns to put away, and are expected to do this in 4 hours while also helping customers and sometimes covering for people's breaks.At least the work itself isn't boring.",2,Current Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Manitowoc, WI",11/7/21,2021,11,7

The older employees have a strong sense of entitlement and refuse to help train anyone who is struggling, while also chastising them for being thrown in completely new. The work itself isn’t hard and it’s the same routine every day, but it gets to be really discouraging when management scoffs and ridicules you for any little mistake made.

"Great people to work with, horrible people to work for","This company will introduce you to some amazing coworkers, many of whom will stay a part of your life for years and years to come. They do offer slightly competitive wages so it's not an easy job to pass up either. At the same time the management leaves something to be desired, no matter what store or what level you are working on. The training provided to management is sub-par and in return you end up with people who do not know how to properly do their job, or at least do it in a way that remains productive and supportive of its associates. Walmart does not offer much in the way of a good home/life balance and will quickly become your main aspect of life, leaving your family/home life to become secondary unless they also accept Walmart as a pivotal role. The customers are rude and most of the time very condescending no matter if they are wrong or right and most of the time you have to just suck it up and deal with it. This can be a great job for some people offering many advancement opportunities, if you know when to jump on them and understand that what can be given can also quickly be taken away.

"It's Walmart, which is fairly self explanatory","If you want to know what it's like to hold a position at a Walmart. Next time you find yourself in one, if you actually make human contact with an employee rather than self-checking out, look in their eyes.

Awesome work family but too many changes from HR. NO COMMUNICATION.  ,Walmart as a whole is a good job for ppl starting in the work world. There is not a ton of room for advancement.  The training aspect does need some work. There is so many changes coming down with absolutely zero communication from higher up. Raises are far and few. Walmart Corp keeps adding and adding to job descriptions but not giving raises. I have build good strong work relationships with my co workers and my direct leader is amazing. Walmart is very accepting and welcoming. After a year... you will realize that Walmart as a corporate business.... only cares about filling the positions. Not about their actually employees.

A large majority of the team leads as well as the people lead make this workplace an unhealthy place to work.

Everyone left to go to break whenever they wanted to. When issues happened management was not around to help. About 4 months while I was at my new store location…. management started treating everyone not so kind. Screaming & yelling every time we did something wrong or not the way they wanted.

Another benefit of being a  Walmart employee is that they will pay 100% of your educational costs regardless of what type of degree you’re working towards.  Everyone at this location tried to treat each other with respect. I started in Digital (OGP) and ended up working as a Cashier in the Front End, the training I received was excellent.

Needed done before next truck would arrive ,1,Former Employee,GM Manager ,"West Des Moines, IA",11/4/21,2021,11,4
Not the worst place in the world,"Retail in general is a soul-sucking void that will break you mentally and physically IF you allow it. The job itself and the team you have will determine really quickly whether or not you're going to enjoy your stay. COVID problems are still preventing much of the work your team needs to do from getting done, but you will still come in expected to clean up the previous shifts mess and get your required job done as well.

Horrible Management. Can't Keep People,"I used to love working for Walmart. It's not the same anymore! The atmosphere is toxic. Management treats workers like peasants. If associates were treated like humans by their coaches, maybe they could keep people. But their turnover rate is the worst I've seen, despite raising their pay to $15.50 an hour.

Could be good if not understaffed,"I enjoyed the work but I didn't enjoy being responsible for 15 cars in the parking lot because we had 2 people scheduled and the managers were always busy. I know this is a corporate issue. They increased number of orders per day and restrict the amount of people they let work at a given time. I was a part time employee working over 40 hours some weeks because of how chaotic and behind they were in completing orders. Often we couldn't take our 2 paid 15 minute breaks. It was very physically demanding as well, lifting all day, working in the hot sun in the summer and in the freezer in the winter, and constantly rushing and having customers yell at you over something you can't control. We had a brief time with proper staffing and lower orders and everything went smoothly, all the customers got their orders timely. We had great managers too by the way. They went above and beyond for the company. I wish Walmart could restructure their OGP department and make it more efficient for everyone's sake. They need to fix their busted EBT machines too, ours were always down. I hate making customers unhappy but there wasn't anything I could do really. Also be prepared for incompetent Shoppers, that don't bag the deli meat, overfill some bags and underfill others, pick rotting produce, and don't properly store the order so you have to go on a manhunt trying to find it. Yeah, all that stuff ends up being the loaders' problem.",3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Middleburg, FL",11/3/21,2021,11,3

Horrible Management ,"The position it's self is not ""bad"". However, the biggest issue is the management. Team Leaders are children (18-19), who have been employed for less than 90 days. They will tell you themselves that they have no idea what they're doing. Upper management is an absolute joke! My I-9 was never even done before I was placed onto the floor, I was NEVER able to clock in using my badge because I was never given a WIN and when I was due to receive my first paycheck, I was told that my hours weren't put into their system in enough time and I would have to wait but that they ""would let payroll know"" so they could send it out ""immediately"". I didn't receive my check until a week AFTER the next pay date. This place has become an absolute joke! ",2,Former Employee,Stocker/Receiver ,"Littleton, NH",11/3/21,2021,11,3

Everyone is very helpful but the job itself is very tiring especially if you’ve never worked an overnight shift or used to being on your feet 8 hours a day. The only thing I’d recommend is that they do a more thorough training.

Also the company is a great company but it comes down to the store you work at and how that manager runs his store. Great pay in being a Team Lead.

"Good pay, bad management, unrealistic expectations",Overall pay is decent for the work but the managers often expect you to do a days worth of work within a few hours and will tell you over and over you are supposed to have it done by a certain time that is unrealistic.

"Job that does not respect employees, if your mean to others you get promoted to manager.","I have worked at walmart for 3 years now and to say the least i would think very hard on what you are willing to give up for a little better pay. The managers are terrible and dont care one bit about how you feel or your life outside or inside work. If you come to work and do your job it will never be enough for managment. The better you are as a worker the more they expect so work slow so they dont take you for granted because they will fire you if your a nice person.

7+ years and nothing to show for it.,"Management at the multiple stores I worked at could care less. They are very cloak and dagger when it comes to leaves, absences and PTO. They change policies and procedures monthly. The promote terrible people over good wholesome people. They favor profit over everything. The only thing I learned from this place was how to handle high stress with little support. Every year they raise the starting pay so that kids who have worked for 2month make more or the same as people who have dumped 10, 20, or even 30+ years into the company. They push people into their positions, sometimes against their will. Salaried members of management go through a training program that drains them of all personality. Finally they could actually care less about any and all of their associates. If you work here? Look for a better place. Take advantage of anything they offer and move on the first chance you get.

"Its Walmart. Weird customers, weirder coworkers","Management is over expecting 90% of the time, especially when the people you work with are less than normal. That just means Management gets to blame toy when the work isn't done tho...",2,Current Employee,Meat and Produce Associate ,"Lakeville, MN",11/2/21,2021,11,2
Fast-paced work day with overbearing leadership ,"The main issue is they look for someone to blame for everything, so the lead picks people to treat like dogs whether or not they’re at fault. So, the lead will find reasons to say you’re the problem even if you’re breaking a sweat and hurting from working hard. ",2,Current Employee,Digital shopper ,"Humboldt, TN",11/2/21,2021,11,2
Good start for customer service and retail experience,"Every store is going to be a different experience. For mine, the management was excellent. Most of them knew most of the associates by name, and they were always willing to help with questions. This store was in a small town, so turnover wasn't as high as it is probably in bigger cities where there are more jobs.When I worked there, the pay wasn't as good as it is currently. There were always options to pickup hours cashiering, and different departments will need extra help for seasonal purposes.One of the most challenging things about working in retail is the customers. Honestly most customers are great, but it's the impatient or rude people that make the job harder than it should be.This store was really into it's accident free streaks, so we would get free food several times each year, which was nice. Advancing your career here is tricky. I think if you work at a store that has a ton of turnover, you could become a mid-level manager within a couple years, but you do need to pass their assessments.Overall, not the worst place to work, in my opinion.",3,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Iron Mountain, MI",11/2/21,2021,11,2
"Not Bad, not great","Its okay, time seems to fly as a stocker. I just hated working night shift which had nothing to do with the job itself. As long as you do you job and dont mess around the managers tend to not bug you. It pays more than minimum wage and it was enough for me to live off of. If your married it's good supplemental income. As with all jobs there is a level of stress and time management is key. Its a decent job, not great but not bad either.",4,Former Employee,stocker ,"Purcell, OK",11/2/21,2021,11,2

Worst management ever,"This place has to have the most mindless management out of any job I’ve had, it’s not good work environment and most choices are made out of personal interest rather then being work/team oriented. The team leads don’t teach the new hires anything and leave them in the dark to just figure it out. Coaches take advantage of their positions so they can treat the workers like butt. Work scheduling is terrible, they won’t give you what you ask for or are available to work instead they give you what works for them rather you’re able to work it or not. Once again, that goes along with the personal choosing aspect. It’s not a good work environment for anyone who is there to make money and possibly start a career, it’s a who can I be best friends with drama pit. Don’t waste your time at this Walmart and definitely try another one if you’re looking to apply. ",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Cicero, NY",11/2/21,2021,11,2

Miserable place. ,"Where to start. You will be treated like garbage. You are simply replaceable. No matter which walmart you choose to work for they are all the same. Management are useless. There is constant favoritism. Moving up the ladder is simply who you KNOW not how hard you work. They do not give you the tools necessary to complete tasks but you're still expected to magically get it done. They took away bonuses. No yearly raises either. Jobs keep getting taken away because the company penny pinches. So after you've been in a management position for 15 years you become a regular associate. Your constantly disrespected, over worked & under appreciated. Coverage is ridiculous, there is never any coverage so you are very over worked & therefore underpaid.

Started out fun and exciting. Poor leadership,"I do not agree that the open door policy works. The company pushes to save leaders that do not deserve their position.

Almost 6 months in and it's a great job thus far,"Started this job nearly 6 months ago and it's going great. I work as a Cap 2 associate, which is widely considered to be the 'backbone' of each location. From the first day on the job, my co-workers, Team Leaders, and direct Coach level managers have been awesome, which may not be the same for everyone, but I feel extremely blessed for this to be the case. In the short time that I've been there, I've garnered the trust of both my co-workers and managers to have run the team several times now, as well as earned certifications in electronic and 'walkie-stacker' lifts. The team I work with are all dedicated to the tasks at hand nightly, and are an extremely close-knit group, as the first task of each day involves unloading general merchandise trucks containing 2-3K boxes of items within a given time-frame. The banter that goes on between us during this process, as well as the overarching goal and task we're doing tends to be a natural bond-builder between co-workers. Perhaps I work at an 'odd location', and that other stores have different work environments, but again, I feel blessed to have the co-workers and Team Leads I have. The only real issues I have with the job are some of the 'corporate' aspects. Some of the inane 'training modules' and some of the procedures you're made to follow seem to be tedious or nonsensical, or simply a waste of time. The break and lunch schedules are great, with 2, 15 minute breaks and an hour for lunch. It allows me to go home for lunch and splits the shift nicely.

Don’t like it? That’s fine, they will just cut your hours. Vengeful management staff. They will hold a mistake over your head until it is beneficial for them to punish you. Management makes a mistake? They cover their rear end by passing the blame off on the employees. If you call them out on it or try to file a complaint, they hold it against you in your performance review. You end up getting a poor review and therefore no yearly raise. Vengeful, hateful, and disrespectful management staff.

Overall pretty chill,"The job was fairly easygoing and simple to do. My managers/APs were cool and pretty laid back. The other managers and team leads had it out for us for some reason, I guess everyone thought our job was too easy.

Isn’t as bad as it seems,"As a cashier I spent most my time on the register, and self checkout. Both really easy, you have binders with food codes to scan the vegetables/fruits and codes for propane refills, makes it really simple. The registers did freeze a lot, they need to update their systems. The worst part about the job was the random schedules and language barriers with management, if you speak Spanish you’ll be fine. Management is actually really nice, they all worked with me to improve or whenever I had an issue. I wouldn’t mind working there again. Pay is also really good for that work. 2 15 minute paid break and an hour unpaid lunch break if you work a certain amount of hours.

Stable work place but not flexible and not many optiona for advancement,Ive been working at walmart since i was 17. I was overjoyed when i first got the job. It was a big step up from my minimum wage job beforehand. It helped a lot while i was in highschool but as soon as i graduated i realized this was not a place i wanted to stay. You have to kiss a** to advance in pay and they are not very flexible.  Even if you do go up in management prepare to make walmart your life. ,3,Current Employee,OGP Associate ,Claremore Oklahoma,10/30/21,2021,10,30

Draining ,Team Lead position is not bad on days I have support from the management with me.

Awful.,"I’ve never had more problems with the management at a place than I did at Walmart. Which is crazy to me because I worked with staff that was entirely made up of teenagers at other places. Some members of management were so snarky and rude to you it’s crazy. They would make you feel like you were nothing. And, they would assign you multiple tasks and expect it done in a seven hour shift. That’s not including going and helping other departments because you have to. And, they all have obvious favorites. If you were not a favorite, you would not get treated with respect. I hated this job more than I’ve hated a job and I’ve been doing retail for a long time now. Maybe if they fix the management problem it would be a better place, but until then I highly discourage anyone from working at Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Team Associate ,"Layton, UT",10/30/21,2021,10,30

Apples to Apples Walmart is better than many,"Speaking for the individual location I work within, the environment is pretty hectic during this pandemic.The biggest area for improvement could be sourcing new talent.

Worst Company EVER,"I have been with company over 14 years and it has gone down hill. Thousands of changes has happen over the last 10 years and it has gotten worse and stores are loosing so many good workers because of the changes.I feel that the CEO does not care about anyone and wants to get rid of long-term associates.. More and More 10+ year associates are leaving the company because of new hires making more than them... The company has gotten rid of department managers and replaced them with ""Team Lead"" and now the departments look really BAD!Assistant managers are now ""Coach"" no such thing in retail.. The CEO and board of directors approved these changes and now the company has turnover rate that is the highest in retail HISTORY!Company motto for associates ""Great Workplace"" This is in fact NOT a True statement... It is Totally False!CEO needs to wake up and so does the board of directors in which they should see why the company now has a 95.8% turnover rate throughout the whole company!CEO should be fired and replace with someone that knows how to run a successful company.. Walmart has gone downhill since all of these changes and will loose more and more associates as ALL Walmart stores do not have the help at all!

A reliable place to make a little bit of money,Consistent work if you want it. After a small amount Of time you start to earn paid time off.

Terrible ,"First off they treat their employees like disposable garbage if you have any complaints or concerns about your job they tell you that you are lucky to even have a job and they keep insinuating that you are replaceable very easily. They use that excuse on just about everything from pay being low, hours being terrible, family emergencies. They don't make you feel like you matter there and if you need a manager for a customer you will have to wait 30 minutes that is if they are not in a meeting. If corporate shows up they tell you will be fired if you make any complaints about your work in there presence.  Now I don't know if this can be said about all locations but this was my experience over 2 locations and four years.

Overall not worth it and there’s a reason for high turnover ,The overnight shift really does put a damper on your soul. Unless you know you are a night owl and you can stay up until 7am this job will physically destroy your body. The sickly feeling after a shift and wanting to just sleep until an hour before your next shift just isn’t worth it.

We were understaffed most of the time and we would constantly get reprimanded for the floor looking terrible when there were only two people on the floor with no extra help. There was drama between the morning and night shifts. Team Leads were great but there was a lot of favoritism. I was having health issues and I asked management to lower my hours because they would have me work 40 hours although I was part time and I was told that the hours wouldn't changed until the end of the week cycle. The hardest part of my job was definitely my health issues getting in the way of my job and management not understanding my situation along with constant gossip and drama in the workplace. I learned that I couldn't trust anyone in this company and not even management, which sucked because I really would of stayed if they were a bit more understanding and cared about their workers.

Prior Place of Employment,"Customer service was made to handle much of the front end including but not limited to running the service desk, money services, returns, complaints which were many, lottery, candy and miscellaneous check out aisle stocking, self check out with rarely more than 2 or 3 people per shift.  Management nor the district manager cared how it got done just do it.  Management and the district manager were just a joke and intentionally clueless. They were obviously in it for their bonuses which could be obscenely large.  Literally any job is better than this one.

The employees make the job easy to tolerate but the management makes it difficult,The higher management are not good with talking to employees. They talk down to them instead of to them.

"Not for a lifetime, depends on what you like.","Walmart is a very greedy company as a whole. Lots of smoke, screens, and mirrors. You may get a 4 day schedule, but it is definitely not a place for single parents. Work days can start at 4:30 am and still end at 4 pm which is highly inconvenient for kids. If you are a favorite to a manager you will progress just fine. Working hard doesn’t get you rewarded here, yet they do have a lot of courses you can take to advance yourself for $30 a month. I would say it is a stepping stone company for something better. The pay is super decent, but it just isn’t worth the time you will put in and the work in shipping is very hard on the body. Anywhere else in the warehouse is decent, but those same rules apply. Don’t get hurt; it will always be your fault. If you are hurt outside of the job, good luck on keeping the job secured. Also, a messy place as far as the workers go. Super nosey people who love rumors.",3,Current Employee,Freight Handler ,"Searcy, AR",10/27/21,2021,10,27

Online Grocery ,Online grocery had to be the easiest job in the store. It’s just when down time came around we had to stock.

Honestly not worth it,"Walmart has 0 care for its workers unless you’ve been working 10+ years. Management will ignore bad workers (people who take 30 minute for their 15 minute breaks, people who wander the store, people who will go work in other departments while theirs is understaffed) and pound out on good ones for the smallest mistake. They have 0 compassion for injuries or life events. You won’t be properly trained either. ",2,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Kingsland, GA",10/26/21,2021,10,26
Bad management and fired after requesting accommodations,"The work I did at walmart was fine albeit boring, but I ended up working at a store 30 miles away after they flagged me as a hire AFTER I turned down a overnight stocking position, communication was terrible and there no way of contacting the store other than going to it and even then it was impossible to find management and people in higher positions often had a superiority complex. The job was simple but it would be normal for there to be 7-10 people in one area, but maybe half would actually be working. The store did nothing about slackers or people doing absolutely nothing meaning all work would fall upon the people actually doing their jobs. I’ve worked at 2 stores and neither actually train you and instead make you watch ~3 hours of videos which mostly did not correlate to your actual position, the people who were expected to train you were fellow associates who are not paid to train new people and often are not interested in assisting. The main problem I encountered was after requesting to change to days due to taking antidepressants and anxiety medication and ended up being let go after being told to take a week or two off to wait for the request to be processed to be changed. I live in an area that lacks jobs that provide a living wage and now I am forced to find work before my rent comes due next month due to this, while still suffering from depression and anxiety, so thanks Walmart love you ",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Elm Springs, AR",10/26/21,2021,10,26

They do not offer a flexible schedule, you just take what you get and there's no changing it.  The job itself was fairly easy once you get the hang of using the knowledge base.

"Great co-workers, Horrible manager ","Good place to work in general  Co-workers are great, easy to get along with.. felt like a family. The manager is the big problem you get in trouble for trying to learn and ask questions. They aren't understanding if you get sick and can't come in they blame you for not trying hard enough to get better (actual words).  All the people in charge do things differently and you get in trouble if you don't do exactly what the manager says even though other people in charge said you could and other coworkers do the same thing.  A lot of stress especially when the manager won't even let you take a second to catch your breath must always be doing something even if there is nothing to do you'll still get in trouble  (Co-workers have personally mentioned this Issue to me) There is definitely favoritism Select few people get all the best shifts and never have to close but once a week or not at all and don't get in trouble for the same things other people do. If you work here keep your mouth shut, always be doing something and don't ask questions or try to learn anything. Because you won't last long. They don't appreciate employees trying to learn, coming in to help work at a moment's notice or covering co-workers shifts and working extra hours.

No concern shown at all from the Super-center , nor Corporate. They also refuse to send me my pay, which they continue to give me the run around about. Training was very frustrating, due to the fact managers where NEVER present when they needed to be.

The store manager sets ridiculous goals to complete and does not provide the proper tools or support to complete the goals they set out. However, there are decent co-workers that make the day pass by. ",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Woodstock, IL",10/25/21,2021,10,25

Decent if you can handle it ,"Every position gets paid differently, yet it is expected that you work everywhere in the store without the extra pay. You may be hired for apparel, but you’ll be a stocker, cashier, and whatever else they need. Management is terrible. they’ll make you feel not good enough if you can’t work everywhere. HR doesn’t care they’ll side with management. Most work is put onto the lower associates while management just sits in the office or walks around. But hey the pay is higher than most places.

Worked to death and cheated out of bonuses and pay increases,Walmart puts on a front of being a positive company to promote and care for workers! In reality they increase wages for a few so they can say they pay higher! Benefits are discount healthcare plans! Bonuses are based on points and often will add points by mistake but that affects bonus payouts! Pay increases are not given .. 23 cents per year! Worked to death as they are always short staffed! Sedgewick disability does nothing to help a sick employees and although it’s online they want paperwork on top of Drs notes! Walmart uses them to avoid paying employees that give up as the system is so difficult for sick people! Unsafe working conditions! No unions! No security in stores so we are left to fend for ourselves! Spoken to very abusively by certain management! Totally demoralizing job! Worked to death for an unlivable wage!

"The Job was Fine, The Management was horrible","Stocking is simple, but the Managers don't just want you to stock. They want you to cut corners everywhere so you also have time to do things that they're supposed to do themselves. The micromanaging was very prominent, and you'd get written up very easily. The managers won't bother with trying to correct false points in the system until it's almost too late, and they also try to shorten the beginnings and ends of the breaks. Overall not a good place to work, especially since morning shift Isn't made to do anything before we get there. Would've been better if we hadn't shuffled through so many managers because they quit or got fired for misconduct.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"West Memphis, AR",10/25/21,2021,10,25

A really fun and enjoyable place to work,A typical day you have your family meeting the Manager walks around says hey to everyone and checks on everything. The job itself isn't hard at all.

Very basic starter or part-time job,"You’re hired under a certain position but will often help in all positions of your department. For example I was hired as a cashier but helped all of the front end of the store, like carts, self checkout, and others. I assume the other departments are the same. Overall not a bad place at all. There is now a raise to 15 per hour so complaints I had when I was making 11 don’t matter. I didn’t like how I helped all over the front end but was paid the same as people who truly couldn’t care less at all but the extra 4 dollars an hour would have made that feel better.

I was way happier going to work at Walmart because I was treated like a human being and my schedule was more flexible. At Target the pay was good but my quality of life and happiness was not good.

Do work for a position you are not paid for,"Other co workers (associates) are the best part of the job. The management does not communicate with each other. Multiple managers will tell you do do a task at the same time but it's different tasks. Often the task you are told to do is running freight. Sales floor associates make the least amount in the store and often are expected to do the most work. No one on the sales floor gets to stay in their department but does get told how they are not doing their job even though management pulls you from your department to do a different job. It goes on all day every day like this.  The store is understaffed.  The benefits for full time employees are bottom barrel, medicaid is required for a secondary if you are paying for a family. Because they have employees pay 25 percent out of pocket, mental health is not covered, 13000 dollars is a family Yearly deductible. It's cruel.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Rep. ,"Terre Haute, IN",10/24/21,2021,10,24
Not worth your time or effort,From the managers on down very poor productivity and commitment. If your work ethic is outstanding you will be pushed to the point of burn out meanwhile fellow lazy very low effort employees never get coached or even spoken to about their inability to contribute the bare minimum.  Some unprofessional members of management who can't control their emotions/anger constantly harassing you about absolutely small things that otherwise never bother them is one form of retaliation they use against you if you decide you want to speak up about something. 9 times out of 10 your breaks are pushed up more than an hour and a half as well as associate and management alike taking longer breaks than authorized. Health assessments not being done daily before your shifts also a problem at this location so imagine the nasty prize you've won by catching covid or covid like symptoms that you would have to worry about bringing home to your family. ,1,Former Employee,Online Grocery Associate ,"Holly Hill, FL",10/24/21,2021,10,24

Bait and Switch Tactic,"  Getting a job at Walmart is very easy. The employee turn around is extremely high. The majority of management are very inexperienced in their job roles. Some are only promoted to the position due to let’s say Walmart politics. You can pretty much expect to make what you start out at for the duration of your employment.  If you miss 5 calendar days in 6 months without taking leave time that isn’t 100% guarantee you will get approved for you will be terminated no matter what the reason. Example your at work have a mild heart attack and you already had 4 points against you. If you don’t apply for leave and get approved you will be fired.  That being said the job is very easy, aside from the customers that take their frustrations out on you daily.  The only thing you have to do for this job to not get terminated is just clock in and out with a 9min window from you shift and you have no worries of job termination.

Management depends on who you work with, you’re  mostly on your own. Lunch is ok. It’s a very easy job that sometimes gets boring depending on the day. Working in dairy was fun, you sometimes would work in the freezer for the whole day or a few hours. Fill milk, fill eggs, stock dairy. Working at night was fun since no one is around especially in the freezers. You do work, go home, get paid.

"Unless you have friends higher up the food chain, don't","Before you even bother applying, check to see what the relationship is like between managers and the store manager, and then the store manager with regional and market management.  If the store manager is in any way antagonistic towards the assistant managers, that's your first red flag. If the store manager is friends with the market or regional managers, that's another red flag because that makes using Open Door near impossible when you need it because you can't skip levels.While sniffing around, talk to associates all over the store and get an honest opinion of the areas and the managers over them. Find out if they know of anything that required an Ethics hotline call (or 23 in one case I know about personally). This is another place where learning about the relationship with regional and market is vital. If there have been Ethics reports but the store manager is friends with market or regional management, you already know nothing will get the resolution that it requires.If you are somehow impervious to in-store politics (no one is if you want to do so much as become a CSS or department manager) and don't mind still needing government assistance while busting your bottom 40+ hours a week, go for it.  I have met amazing store managers willing to go to bat for their associates against home office, but they really do feel like rare diamonds in a sea of a word Indeed won't let me use.

I loved working for Walmart.,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for Walmart, until my manager plotted to get rid of me until I finally found employment elsewhere.

I never asked for help and my inventory was one of the best in the store. When I left the girl that took over always required help and the inventory became a mess. I know this because my husband still worked at the store. I believe that management shouldn't put their other employees against each other. In the end, they learn a valuable lesson. If someone is doing their job and you are seeing the real results, which they could easily see during inventory, then leave them alone to do that job and it's smart to keep your good employees.

"Good people, part of me wishes circumstances were different, but I'm glad with how things worked out.","For a first job during my last year of high school, I'd say it was alright, but I wish I could/would have gotten out of there sooner. It was nothing against the company or associates, but as I gained experience under my belt, it ground down on my mental health at an exponential rate. It was a very ""its not you, its me"" kind of situation.I'd say the pay was alright at the start, but after only getting (to my knowledge) one raise, It began to feel less gratifying. It started out as a place for me to get work experience and money on the side. As time went on, however, and money became a bigger deal in my life, not seeing any difference in pay started to hurt.However, what really kept me coming back was the human interaction with both customers and associates. After high school, I never got out much, apart from college, but that left much more to be desired social interaction wise, so I relied on my job to get that. However, the job became very grating; I started having to deal with mental health issues, and I eventually had to address them. I decided to leave to work on my mental health with the help of my family. This resulted in me leaving the company.I needed a change of scenery, and Walmart wasn't providing it, so I had to look elsewhere.

The job needed atleast 3 people(according to higher ups, that was how many people were supposed to be working), but it was always just me. I could handle it mostly but I'm not a super hero, they had extremely unrealized expectations, and if I ever had a day off nobody would do ANYTHING so whenever I got back I had to pick up the slack because I had to carry the entire thing on my back. I almost never got to go home on time because they would ask me to stay just overtime almost everyday just so everything could get done. I'd go out of my way everyday to try and get everything done, sometimes staying 10 hours a day, and if I ever left on time instead of staying they'd sometimes understand but other times they would act as if I was just being lazy or something, or as if I just unreasonably quit. And you know what, fine, I'm not that mad about it, but for how much work they wanted me to unrealistically accomplish on my own that I went out of my way to do for months upon months I wasn't paid much of anything. It felt like I was being exploited with how little pay I was getting for something so demanding with no help. If you're gonna leave everything to one person for months instead of hiring new people when the job needs 3 you could atleast pay them more. After 6 months I we're supposed to get a raise anyway, and yet nearly a year of working later and that raise never came. I feel like this job probably isn't all that bad depending - more...",3,Former Employee,Meat/Produce Associate ,"Laplace, LA",10/21/21,2021,10,21

Easy Enough Job but Management Issues,"Workplace culture among associates is fantastic, management on the other hand are very favorited under the store manager and are given too much free reign over their departments. The daily work is quite simple and easy to complete although most departments require constant upkeeping.

It is rarely new and better. As soon as the program is launched the teams are dissolved so there is little support to help you out with issues. The company is very numbers and task driven. Less and less consideration is given to people and staffing is awful. H.O. dictates your hours and headcount. Which is as bad as it sounds.

We also pretty often didn't have the equipment we needed to do our jobs because it seemed to mysteriously vanish. Walmart in general is a disorganized mess. Something was always broken or going wrong, and our equipment was not maintained nor regularly available. I would see managers from other departments stressed out and crying.

Great management that grooms you for success.  There is a feeling of family among co-workers.  There's lots of room for advancement even up into salaried management.  My managers have worked with me in many ways.  I had some surgery and have a lifetime weight limit of only 25 lbs. The only job I can do now is cashier and that's fine w/me.  I'm on a leave now w/a foot issue, not a work injury, and my management has been VERY supportive w/it.  You do have to go thru a 3rd party co. to file for FMLA.  I hope I'll be able to keep working.  I have many friends there and like most of our customers.  The best part for me is, if a co-worker is harassing you, you can go to management and they'll rein them in.

Decent beginner job. Understaffed. Rude customers. ,"My store is usually pretty understaffed, so you’re working with very long lines. Very late breaks and not much concern from anyone else. $11 which is less than stockers make when you are running register, working directly with each customer. Running self scans. Cleaning messes. Paging. And figuring stuff out yourself when a csm doesn’t respond to their handheld. Lots of turnover. Feels like pointless work most of the time. But it’s not the worst.  If you are 18 but still in high school  you’ll be considered a minor and not able to work before 4 pm or after 11 on week nights.

A mixed bag,"I've worked for Walmart my entire adult life, 7 years now. They worked with me through college and I have promoted well through the company. The benefits are actually ranging from decent to good. That all said the downfall is that when you get placed under a poor store/market manager you can kiss any peace of mind goodbye.

Busy,Walmart really only wants their employees to work more than what they signed up for with their team membership policy. They milk every penny they spend to pay you. For example I work in entertainment but I also have to go everywhere in the store helping out whenever asked. I signed up to be a sales associate for entertainment but have had to go to the back and help in receiving. Makes no sense whatsoever.

Stay away ,Advertised as a job where you could pick your hours and get paid up to $20 an hour. I worked about 15/20 hours a week and barely made minimum wage not including gas/mileage on my car. There are always issues with the app making it difficult to consistently accept orders. If you work here you will have payment issues (missed payments or inaccurate payments) and they will not help you get your money. Support is basically people you never see giving you same generic responses that are meant to make you give up not help you in any sense. They keep hiring more drivers even though everyone is struggling to find work. Many other drivers spend 5-6 hours waiting for offers only to get 2-3 orders. Even their incentive bonus program is a sham. When they offer an extra $50 they really mean if you made $40 during that time they will give you $10 extra. Not worth it. ,1,Current Employee,Spark Driver ,"Lansing, MI",10/19/21,2021,10,19

Absolutely awful,"Working at Walmart has been one of the worst experiences of my life. They advertise a friendly working environment and say they accept and help people with disabilities, but when it comes time to promote, they'll take the main symptom of your disability, throw it back in your face, and tell you you should ""work on that."" They will assign you an amount of tasks that are usually supposed to be decided between 2 or 3 people and then blame you when you don't have enough time to get everything done. They won't train you or give you a bare minimum of training (ex. Half an hour of register training when you're supposed to have a full day before you're sent out on your own) and then get angry with you when you don't know everything. And to cap it all, they don't even pay you enough to afford a one bedroom apartment, even with working 40 hours a week or more. They also do not listen to employee input (ex. A new manager had 13 formal complaints filed against him in the first two months of him working there and management did nothing about it.) DO NOT WORK AT WALMART.

Poorly Run,"I worked as a personal shopper when this department just came out. It was extremely hectic and poorly run. Most of the time I was doing 2 people's jobs and there were definitely times when I was doing close to 5. We are expected to have at least 4-5 people in the back helping us. There were several times when it was just me by myself or only 1 other person. Our marketing manager would constantly deprive us to see how much we could do with the least amount of resources. We had a phone that we had to answer when customers were waiting too long on their orders. This would ring constantly if there was only 1 person in the back. This is because that person can not physically sort every order, then locate the items for every order in the freezer, cooler, and ambient locations and finally dispense those orders while answering the phone. Not every department was like this, and I feel like maybe my store's location was an anomaly, but be prepared to leave this place whenever it gets like this if you are offered a job there.

They always claimed we were the “backbone” of the store as we were responsible for unloading all the product from the trucks, sorting the products, and getting them where they needed to go.

Wouldnt suggest working here, good chunk of customers are also rude and look down on you. Only good thing about this job is the other workers who you can become good friends with.

Good first job,"I started at Walmart as a cashier two years ago which was miserable. The CSMs/leads only would check alcohol for minors when they felt like it, and often i would have customers waiting over ten minutes. if you have anxiety or depression, do not be a cashier. The management is horrible to you and dealing with customers with such little knowledge of the store that the train you in is stressful.     Walmart Pickup is probably the best department in the store. Fast past, you work as a team, you get a good understanding of the store and learn so much more outside of just your department, which helps you advance. If i wanted to be a lead or manager, i know it’s in my reach with a little bit of work. But only having one manager that is never around and two leads that only work mornings and end up only doing a regular associates job, the more experienced associates get stuck with the customer service and the stress of getting problems figured out and calling customers constantly. Walmart as a whole is a good place to work for. They’re good about breaks and flexible availability (unless they’re understaffed) the pay is decent but not worth if if you’re a dedicated worker that cares about getting stuff done and doing it well. the harder workers often get under appreciated and underpaid for all they do.

It varies from store to store,"Have been in several stores throughout my career with Walmart and the experience you're going to have depends on your upper management in the store. If you get a good team of salaried managers who generally care about the associates and customers, then it's a great place to work.If you don't? Well, be prepared to slave away and give your blood, sweat, and tears to people who won't even lift a finger to help you.

Inconsistent and non-communicative  ,"First and foremost the job is basically like a roller coaster , it has its good days and usually always the bad. Staffing is always a consistent problem at this location and I was warned that beforehand by the employees. Thought I could give it a go but every time I’m in need of something or have a question to upper management it’s always vague and not responded in a way management should respond. I believe I climbed up the totem pole of the management team minus the store manager and basically am told to go to my night supervisors if there’s ever a problem, but guess what? It never gets fixed. The only thing beneficial about working here is the co-workers you work with and the pay. Even when it comes to requesting off they have to make it as complicated as possible. This is the first employment where I’m always in awe and yet not at the same time. I can give the pointers on how the shift should run and what concerns should be pointed out but when your a lowly employee your words fall on death ears and they tell you to remember your job title. Not impressed and not enthusiastic about anything this company has to offer when management treats you so poorly. I can see why everyone calls out and has no loyalty to the location.

When the top managers state one thing, the “coaches” or department managers and the “team leads” or shift managers completely disregard anything they state or decide and try to overpower their decision.

Over crowded with awful customers ,I was a consumables stocker here for about 3 years. Was good at my job but was never offered a raise or promotion only the suck ups get that. Terrible inconsistent schedule they change daily if you have open availability make sure to not make your availability completely open unless you want your schedule to change every week. Customers where awful for the most part and the main reason I left the company. Be ready to be treated like a sub human on a daily basis. Seriously shame on anyone who treats some one at work like that when they are just trying to make a living. This location is always packed which makes it hard to stock and move around. Another issue is you will sign up for one job and they will have you doing other departments then what's in your job description. Then they will have other employees in your way. For the beginning half of the day you will have to deal with online grocery pickup and morning shift down stocking which gets in the way constantly. The last 2 hours over night comes in and zones the food section we are in every night and gets in the way while we struggle to finish stocking. Who ever decided that's a good idea in management should be fired. Forgot to mention the rude insta cart customers that want you to bend over backwards for them even though they are equipped with a better tools then walmart provides its own employees.

Walmart's desire to drive everyday low prices hurts their employee retention as at their core they strive for quantity over quality not only in employee output but also in entry level employee benefits.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Support Manager ,"Fort Collins, CO",10/14/21,2021,10,14
I enjoyed my coworkers,I liked working at Walmart mostly because my coworkers were like family. We made every day fun. We laughed. Walmart micromanages and doesn’t pay a competitive wage. You can move up if you work hard or are a kiss up.,4,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Winston-Salem, NC",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Its walmart,"Its walmart. you stock shelves and help customers. job is easy nothing that bad about it, but its not the greatest job in the world I guess. you can advance. ",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Powhatan County, VA",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Ok,Depending on where you live it can either be ok or terrible. It's not bad as far as work being done and obviously depends on how good your manager is.,3,Former Employee,Inventory Control Specialist ,"York, PA",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Great place to work,"I was at Walmart as a stocker for 7 months and overall it was great! My managers would often thank us for our hard work and remind us of how much we are needed for the store to operate efficiently. It was a wonderful experience where I got along with my managers and coworkers. Our pay went from $12 to $14, so I could work less hours and still make the same or more amount I made when I worked for $12. ",5,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Indianapolis, IN",10/14/21,2021,10,14
After 2 years I would never work here again,A handful of management actually works. Works off a point system 5 points your fired. Management that do not work just hide in the Ad office. Co-works who do nothing basically get the same raise that others do for actually working. Most management has no clue how to run their department. Most management wont help out if your backed up in your department. ,1,Former Employee,Walmart Online Grocery Pickup ,"Osage Beach, MO",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Always understaffed.,"They are flexible with your schedule. You get the hours you need. However, they are understaffed most of the time. I don’t know how people stay working there for such a long time.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Westminster, CA",10/14/21,2021,10,14
It is very easy to move around within the company but Upper Management live in another reality,"Much of the business is ran with ideals and structure set up at the corporate level that does not work.  Labor hours don't match up with business flow and many Team Leads run without a ""team"".  With the addition to Online Grocery Pickup the hours are even far greater skewed and it often overtakes the store as a priority for hours and workers.  A new teenager hired in online grocery makes more than a cashier that has been there for 10 years and far less stressful.",3,Current Employee,Frontend Zone Manager / Team Lead ,"Farmington, MO",10/14/21,2021,10,14
It's awful,"Please don't ever work here. It's entirely awful. Management does not care about you, they will not listen to what you have to say. They will pretend to offer you a raise or promotion to get you to stay and then never give it to you.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Woodburn, OR",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Poor Management and Training,"In my case, the management was horrible. Orientation was ran poorly — on the second day of orientation no one came to guide the new employees. We had to go looking for someone to come in because managers forgot/the person who was supposed to do orientation just didn’t want to. Little to no training, you basically sink or swim. I was put on the floor without any computer training and my trainer just threw me into my role without proper explanation or guidance.Really just depends on how much you’re willing to bear. I was a personal shopper. Paid lunch breaks, $15/hr, and you can benefit as a college student with their new free tuition program for online school. I just didn’t like the culture and they could care less about their employees.",2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Glendale, AZ",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Flexible schedule but poorly managed,"As a digital shopper, we are often called out on things that are not under our control (such as not being able to pick items due to poor stock). We are expected to perform roles across the store- stocking/cashier. Management are all over the place. You are told different things from each one and the store is poorly stocked and organized. None of the stock is catalogued so when we are looking for things, we can never have a give location for stock of said item",3,Former Employee,Digital shopper ,"Brooklyn Center, MN",10/14/21,2021,10,14
bad job,"it was a good job but the pay wasnt that good i really wish the management was better, I was a cart pusher for so long and they fired me for no reason",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,Texas,10/14/21,2021,10,14
Terrible mgmt,"They fire people or demote people with experience if they are long time employees and replace them with people who dont know anything about the department.

Too much stress,Worked as the apparel processor in cap 2 for five months and the expectations were impossible to meet. The stress of not being able to process every single item before the end of my shift caused me to leave Walmart every night sobbing. ,2,Former Employee,Apparel Processor ,Kentucky,10/14/21,2021,10,14
They don’t respect your hours and time off request. ,"It is okay to work half of the time. Customers are always grumpy because things are done wrong in the back of the store and cashiers usually get the backlash. They don’t respect students out of high school even after multiple times to fix a schedule. The pay is great but everything kind of weighs over it. I would recommend to someone who has a tough head and is willing to give all their spare time to walmart, if not, this job is not for you.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Evans, GA",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Watch your back,"I worked for Walmart in Asset Protection. You are held to a higher standard than the other employees. Which is the way it should be. This position is not for just anyone. Be sure if you stop someone it's a ""good stop"" make sure you read your policies and treat it like the bible!On a bad note the Department Management is horrible at pointing the finger when something wasn't done and you end up doing their job (even if you don't know what the heck you are doing!I would never suggest anyone to work for Walmart. You can ask for open door meeting (only to be shut down) Alot of people are tattle tales and gossipers.",1,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Fort Worth, TX",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Not the best but not the worst company I’ve worked for,"The pay is good, but the management sucks. They all talk bad about one another and if anything goes wrong they blame it on someone else.

"Mindless, repetitive job","Didn't last long because I couldn't bear to spend another day in the same 10x10 area assembling boxes, packing them, and loading them on pallets for 8 hours.

"Easy work, terrible mangagement, low standards for hire leading to petty drama and inefficient work","As a stocker work was easy.

Good work space friendly coworkers but management sucks ,Would work there again if I needed too. The coworkers made the job worthwhile. Managers did at least work with schedules most of the time. Holidays were rough though. Sometimes understaffed. ,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"McComb, MS",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Too many changes,"Great place to work, back in the day. Too many recent changes. Some are good, but mostly it isn't.  It all depends on the people in management and HR. Best place to work in either OGP or in receiving. ",4,Former Employee,Cap 1 ,Texas,10/14/21,2021,10,14
Awful managers,"I worked here as a cashier and management is just so poor, were always understaffed, management doesn't care if you need your break you better keep scanning. Not much room for improvement, tried to switch departments many times and wasn't allowed. Oh also customers are awful",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Katy, TX",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Bad Management ,"I worked at 4 different Wal-Mart stores and only 1 store had managers who actually wanted to see you succeed. The other 3 stores managers lied to me about promotions. They'll tell you they are willing to work with schedules until they decide that they can't. Managers will talk down to you. There is no such thing as privacy if you tell a manager something they will all know. Every person who is a manager believes what they say is best no matter what you say, even when they are proven wrong, they blame you. Even if you are part time they will still make you work full time hours, if you tell them you can't they will cut your hours down to almost nothing.

"Long days, always understaffed ",Walmart has an issue from the top down. There’s not enough support to meet the needs of the customers. If you are willing to work hard they will offer promotions but the pay does not justify all the work expected of you. Things change often and the communication is terrible. Turnover is very high and customers can be unforgiving.,3,Current Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Westwood, KS",10/14/21,2021,10,14
System,"They will play with your HOURS. They do not care about you well being or your reasoning for calling out. Working at a fast food is way better then working at Walmart. They are money hungry, they will refuse to give you enough hours. They will remove/add hours out of nowhere and at last minute too. So you can’t even plan anything until your near that day because they always editing your schedule. Unprofessional.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Lake Worth, FL",10/14/21,2021,10,14
Good company management could be better though ,"Liked working here meeting new people working on conversational skills but management was terrible anytime I would need assistant at my register customers card not working, coupons not working, needing change, etc. it always took them 20-30 mins to come help me did not look good for the company when I’m sitting there telling customers I’m sorry there taking so long.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Amarillo, TX",10/14/21,2021,10,14

Your success depends on who you know as opposed to what you know.,"Most of the jobs here are simple enough to learn. They will work with you on schedules for the most part. Those are about the most positive things I can say. New hires are often paid more than the people that are already there, regardless of experience. If you try to discuss this with management you are treated dismissively and labelled a problem worker. Promotions are based on who you are friends with in the management team. Your ability to do your job is only important if you are not a ""yes"" person. They value subservience as opposed to actual competence.",3,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Radcliff, KY",10/14/21,2021,10,14

It's Walmart,"Everyone knows what goes on at Walmart. The employees don't want to be there, the customers don't really want to be there, they endlessly try to promote a ""company culture"" that no one but management buys into at all. If you want a simple job as a cog in the machine, where it's hard to get fired unless you egregiously mess up, then you can work here. You know what you're getting into.My coworkers were friendly enough, everyone's just trying to put food on the table, but my manager was horrible. She didn't care about me, only talked to me when I messed up in some small way, never gave any positive reinforcement and rarely even smiled. When I went to her for assistance or with a question, she never really helped and always deflected to someone lower on the totem pole. I was fired because even though I clearly told her about my upcoming leave of absence, she forgot come a couple of months down the line and terminated my employment without even a single attempt to contact me.The work itself is boring but consistent. You'll be doing the same thing every day. I never felt like I was trained fully- like there were some nuances of the job they just didn't take the time to tell me. It wears you down if you work long hours like I did. Be selective when you first give your availability- if you tell them you're essentially available whenever, they WILL schedule you for as much time as they can get. I ended up working 40-45 hour weeks as a supposedly ""part-time"" employee.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Saint Cloud, MN",10/13/21,2021,10,13
Walmart could be so much better,"Walmart is one of the most profitable companies in the world.Walmart has an internal slogan of ""do more with less.""  Which clearly translates to do more work with fewer employees and resources.They teach you the proper method of stocking shelves labeling and handling issues, but then they provide you with insufficient physical resources insufficient personnel and hours to complete these tasks properly. They encourage ignoring safety rules, cutting corners and half-assery.With all the money and influence this company has, they could single-handedly turn around the American economy by paying its workers better, and hiring to a viable staffing level.I worked there for over 12 years. Because there is a couple of helpful things that happened, I suffer anxiety and depression and Walmart allowed me to modify my schedule as needed to accommodate my issues. And allowed me to take off the time I needed. Well this was helpful for me, they never covered my position by calling anyone in, so anytime that I took for my mental health, the rest of my team would have to suffer because they would never call anyone in to cover an absence.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Las Vegas, NV",10/13/21,2021,10,13

Walmart @ 2 different facilities,"I've worked at two facilities in the past year. The first one had some of the best management I have ever had for a team on any job. They actually cared about their employees. When an issue arose, they took the time to solve the problem on it. They actually listened to the needs of their employees.The second facility was okay with management. The People Lead was kind of rude from time to time before she quit. She was not the most friendly at times. Several of the managers was not willing to step in to help the department I worked in. We were the top priority department due to our schedule of orders from 7 am to 7pm. There was often fights between upper management and the employees there. We were also changed over management for our department & not given a manager trained in our group. We had 2 other management members who were trained in our department but they gave us someone else. Often lower statured employees had to fix his mistakes when we shouldn't have to. My team lead was amazing though. She was super sweet and understood many of us had lives outside of our job.

No Training ,"I received absolutely no hands on training when I first started (only computer videos/a cashier game). We were always understaffed, and on my second day I was the only one running the department (electronics) until the afternoon shift came in. Horrible management, however HR was nice. Our department had a temporary manager and she demanded me to do things while refusing to teach me how to do them. She would also schedule me outside of what was agreed upon and she said “I schedule people based on when they’re needed.” I was a part timer working more hours than the full timers… Made no sense. I asked if she could cut my hours and give them to some of my coworkers because they wanted them. One of my coworkers would even stay an hour past her shift almost everyday just to get more hours. Needless to say, I didn’t stay long. The only good thing were my coworkers, they were all kind, except for one, but he later apologized to me for his behavior towards me so we ended on good terms. If it weren’t for the manager I had, I probably would’ve loved the job. ",2,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Lawton, OK",10/13/21,2021,10,13

I have good work ethic, or at least I worked hard at it. Had no complaints,until new management came in. Which they do on a regular basis, No one stays for a long period of time in management. This choice  of new management left a lot of us wondering what were they thinking. I left on my own, otherwise I would probably still be dealing with the micromanagement going on. Others are still there dealing with it ,because they need their jobs understandably. Things there still haven't  changed and won't until management changes yet again.

Higher up management expects you to worship them. Lazy workers can stay lazy, but the people that do the most are always expected to do more. When raises were brought up, overnight management would give speeches about how we'd all be measured by time and let go if we weren't deserving of the new pay rates. They always had times quoted for aisles, like ""there's an hour and a half of freight on your aisle, you need to be done by lunch and go help this other aisle."" Meanwhile the so-called hour and a half of freight was like 7 fully stuffed carts and like half a pallet. The inaccurately measured freight times were most nights. Whatever system is in place that calculates length of time for freight is so off. Then the next nights meeting they're calling people out for taking too long to do the freight they were assigned and/or never making it to the next place.

Then I went to deli there was absolutely no direction. Since the managers don't pay attention, we have to pick up all the slack others leave behind. I hear this to be true in most departments. The managers are under trained and expect too much from you. ",2,Current Employee,Deli / bakery academy trainer ,Pennsylvania,10/11/21,2021,10,11
Stressful environment ,"Walmart is a hostile environment to workers who require sick days. Not much training is offered, and employees are often left without relief support for breaks. Corporate employees want front end people to remain at their posts, though sometimes shortages mean it's necessary to do multiple jobs at once, i.e. greeting and cart retrieval, or running messages to the service desk. Poor scheduling is part of poor managerial planning. ",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Troy, MO",10/10/21,2021,10,10

Theres NO set dairy crew and no fresh cap 2.. its a dedicated grocery walmart store and they will legit throw you wherever they feel they need you. Its absolutely chaotic and unorganized!

When it was Jet,Jet was a good company until walmart took it over. I rated this from when I worked for Jet. It was fun and they did special things different times of year. Like for october there was halloween dress up and prizes. they also did a breast cancer awareness event to raise money for the cause.

I've never experienced worse management in my life and I'm generally a very easy-going person. HR was also very clearly there to protect the company and not the workers, every single worker I know who spoke with HR only had complaints to give afterwards. The work is easy, so easy that it becomes robotic and it's hard to enjoy a day at work. The only thing preventing a single star rating was the nice paycheck and the flexibility of scheduling.

I had trouble keeping the bunkers and coolers stocked, I'd fill it and customer's would buy it out not long after it was put out, so holes happened where I didn't have our products stalked although I tried my best to quickly fill the holes but management was never happy with the way the dept looked, my boss would also come in the cooler and throw crates around if he didn't see the entire department well stocked.  I needed more help but couldn't get management to give me much help and they were always mad because they department wasn't fully stocked, that became very stressful.  I decided to find a new job and left Walmart, the pay wasn't worth the stress.

Fun Coworkers and jobs with not so great management.,"Working at Walmart has been one of the biggest roller coasters of my life. The management hasn't been that great, But the people I work with can be fun. The job tasks aren't all that hard, but they can get repetitive. My biggest problem is it feels like not a lot of the overhead managers care about how you feel or what is going on in your life.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Clinton, UT",10/8/21,2021,10,8

Worst management and colleagues ever.,"This walmart has the rudest and untrustworthy management and colleagues. The employees can't even stock or enter items into the system correctly.

"Understaffed and Manager get mad, when you can’t do 3 peoples jobs.",The managers over work you and make you take on every department of the store. They then expect you to have everything 110% done.

Average ,Average in every way. And better than most corporate career positions. People aren't actively looking to bring down your performance or sabotage being valued for your work.

Working at Walmart,"I have been at Walmart for almost two years. The dramatic restructuring and change in management has 100% killed morale. The restructure did away with bonuses, no need for interviews for management positions that are hourly. Salaried management picks their favorite and just places them. If you have been there any length of time, as in decades, new hires make more than you do and do less. The flexibility for a change in availability or requesting time off, denied. There have been individuals forced to give up their FT status due to changes in ""who does the schedule."" Your time off requests denied, but in the same breath salaried management tells you just to use PPTO. Not right. Unrealistic expectations as good workers are penalized as they get burnt out, but new associates are never held accountable. Online Grocery Pickup is treated as a ""extra hands,"" in a sense that they rush you through picks so they can ship them off to other parts of the store. Then when last minute picks fall in, it's a scramble to try and complete them. This is to make up for the lack of hiring taking place. COVID-19 restrictions have become a joke as the temp table often isn't manned and associates that have taken precaution with the appropriate leaves are rushed back to work, at times having not received their NEGATIVE COVID-19 test.

Fun workplace with lots of amazing personalities,"A typical day at work starts at 10 PM and ends at 7 AM 5 days a week. I learned how shelves are stocked from the trucks to the backroom, to aisles and finally to the shelves. Workplace culture is great. You can be yourself and coworkers are mostly cool and helpful. Lots of amazing people here. The hardest part of the job is meeting target hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is working an aisle by yourself listening to music while having a workout and hangout with amazing personalities on breaks and lunch times.

"Management didn’t handle Covid well, caused us to be in a mess. ","Honestly the culture with coworkers and some management was fun but, it gave us heavy and fast work.

The management is all over the place. Better communication would do wonders for store 3192,There is a lot of unnecessary work being done. There isn't a standard procedure in place to allow the different shifts to communicate with each other the information needed so that one shift isn't repeating work done on the previous shift. Favoritism is also there. But they are good about doing little extras for the employees. Like ordering pizzas or having some little thing for you in the break room.

Not all Walmarts but definitely mine..,The managers if you can even call some of them that do nothing and are very unprofessional. They speak to you anyway they want and bend and make up rules as they see fit and if you complain to the store manager little to nothing is done about it.,2,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Stockbridge, GA",10/5/21,2021,10,5

It is a fairly easy low pay job,I worked as a sales floor associate and it was an easy going job but very busy with lots of workloads. Management could use some improvement and bring more diversity along the board but they are not as willing to make a change. pay decreases or increases in different departments as well. Home and Apparel are the lowest payed which is quite unfair. Lots of employees and Team Leads quit within a year or less but they get replaced just as quickly. Good luck working here if you're interested!,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Green Bay, WI",10/5/21,2021,10,5
horrible ,"Forced to work more than a part time employee should with no benefits, no respect for class schedule, lied about my role, no flexibility, severely understaffed because of bad management, on a scale of 1-100 employees needed to be over 120% production as if we were robots.

Good amount of PTO! Pay is below the area average.,Policy changes are not for the associates but how it will help the shareholders. It gets sent to the managers to role out and you are taught to tell the associates that it is for their benefit even know you can clearly see it is not. It’s no surprise that a lot of associates don’t trust management.PS. PTO is paid out for hourly but not for salary. They will take money away from you if you run out of time but will not pay you for unused time.,2,Former Employee,Area Manager ,MD,10/5/21,2021,10,5

Everything slowly goes down hill,Alright at first but then slowly starts to go down hill.  A lot of people don't pull their weight. Managers are never around and if they are they take forever to show up which means that while you're waiting for them you have to stand around looking stupid.

"Pay You Pretty Well, Pretty Much A Stable Job, Management Most Of The Time Sucks","Walmart is a good place to work, teaches you a lot of skills and promotes hard work. Of course there are areas of the store that does less work than others but the pay kinda of reflects that. There is room to move up in the company, they want you to do that.

If you are offered full time they do provide decent benefits, 401K and Insurence, 10% discount on non food/ not already discounted products. This is just a little bit about working there. In my personal opinion it’s not a bad place to work but, it’s retail so you have to be a people person and also be able to work by yourself sometimes. Have to probably do your job and someone else’s job as well.

It's not about the associate; you get paid to work the hours and at the end of the pay period you get paid. Yes, the customer is King! Pretty simple! How you fit in is up to you, the pride in your work shows as does your attitude. It's your job to know your job. If there's a problem, you can file a complaint and say your piece but change doesn't come easily. Persistence and quality work does speak for itself.

"Hard Work, Decent Pay, Lots Stress","I was a walmart stocker at the company and every other day it’s either an insane amount of work or it’d be a relaxing day. But when it was a hard day, it was a hard day. The schedule was good on paper but we’d usually leave late and get overtime. The issue is that, later in the week they’d cut hours to avoid paying the overtime so that would mean we’d have less time to finish work at the end of the week.",3,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Katy, TX",10/2/21,2021,10,2

The worst place to work,Shopping at Walmart is already stressful enough. However working there is suicidal. The employees don’t care about the customers and management doesn’t care about the employees or the customers. Everything is like a click in that store.

Boring not fun workplace,The lower level management is always being yelled at by the upper level managers. So they I'm turn treat the regular employees like garbage. They have a meeting at the beginning of the work shift daily to tell everyone they need to work harder and be better. If they are blamed for something that happened you will feel it that week by the atmosphere of the work place. Never been to a job that I was in physical body pain on almost a daily bases from working at the job. We where told we we started that are position was supposed to have 35 employees working to get all the work done. But they only had 8 to 12 people working daily and new people would come in last for a week or two and then quite. When I was hired in after 3 months I was the only employee left from my hiring group. I moved to another state they told me I was a good worker they wanted to transfer me but the jobs where I was moving was a one to two dollar paycut. I ended up finding a better job that pays more best decision of my life!

Management sucks and never got proper training. I understand why everyone leaves the online ordering position so soon because you aren’t appreciate no matter how hard you work.

Now you just get 2% of your hourly rate.: No more paid holidays, what is that? now you have to request your PTO hours that you have   worked & accured, if you want to get holiday pay.Also almost every day the work environment is very stressful especially when there is a visit from corporate management.

The managers don’t even acknowledge us unless they see something wrong and then it just for them to yell at us for them not telling us what needs to be done. Yeah and that “communication” that makes things work is non existent. If you have an issue, management  will send you running around to other managers and not fix your problem for weeks.  Shoppers are rude because there is non coverage where coverage is needed. so your not only getting treated badly by managers and department managers but also customers. it makes everything more stressful and depressing.

They work with you but you are subject to bad decisions from the top,"A typical day at work can have you working anywhere from cashier, to selfcheck, to pushing carts because we dont have enough cart pushers. Management is constantly hampered by those above them and there is only so much they can do to help with problems. You will run into moments where they didnt have enough people on staff and you just have to muddle through.  I learned a lot about keeping my head down and not making waves at this job. Just be friendly to your managers and you wont have a bad time. The culture feels like you suffer through these bad times together and you do your best to keep the store running against corporates best attempts at destroying productivity.  The hardest part of the job is not complaining when its something that cannot be fixed.The most enjoyable part of the job is how respectful they are of your time.

Its average job,Clocking in and out a minute early or a minute late you get a point. Disorganized and the language they use among each other is embarrassing and disturbing. Management and leads is no where to be found nor care to check in or help out or know how to answer any questions. They don't give you the schedule you signed up for and randomly schedule you. HR just pushes you off since they don't want to deal with you and lock themselves in the office. Pays little for the amount of work you do for them. ,2,Former Employee,Baker ,"Vadnais Heights, MN",9/29/21,2021,9,29
Generally great job,I was a department manager until they changed to a team system. I was doing everything I did as a department manager but was just another associate.

The environment is rather relaxed and the most important thing about my job is helping customers. The main issue is that management has a problem with not keeping their promises and it can be extremely frustrating when you are told something will change but everyone knows that thing will never change and on it off chance that it does it isn't in the way it was promised.

And if you work 10 hours you get ONE 15 and ONE 20 minute. I actually love warehouse jobs this isn’t my first but this one??? Don’t set yourself up! Pay might sound good at first but I promise it’s not worth it!! You also get 1 1/2 hours of PTO for every 32 hours you work. That’s nothing!!

Not An Ideal Healthy environment ,"Look else where I gave my life to this company and they washed there hands with me to prevent me from leaving the company. This company will use you till you can not do anything else, than dispose of you as a dirty used diaper. They prevent you from growing in the organization if they feel you are a threat in you excelling more than them. They will not help when you come clear to asking for assistance. The whole team is a Sham from Market down ti each salary member of management. ",1,Current Employee,People Lead ,"Santa Clarita, CA",9/27/21,2021,9,27
Overwhelming ,Very over worked and understaffed with no care for patients. All the care is for metrics. Most of the time have to start early and stay late just to complete all the tasks. The technicians are not allowed to do mau tasks that other companies allow,2,Current Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,"Taylor, MI",9/27/21,2021,9,27
Many managers have a strong background that gets shutdown or they become burnt out quickly ,"Walmart has the potential to be a great place to work if they would come up with a plan and stick to it, often times hourly associates dictate the flow and circumstance of what happens in the building regardless of being correct or incorrect.

"Good starter job, easy to get stuck","Overworked and underpaid, management expects you to put your family and personal life behind the needs of the company. They pick and choose who they’d like to promote regardless of experience or performance, your best bet is to start making friendship bracelets with management. Using your days off is difficult if you’re a decent employee because they constantly want you there to pick up the slack from other employees. They don’t give overtime, so sometimes you’re made to take extended lunches when it’s convenient for them so that they can make you stay late or come in on your off days.

One day you could work 8 hrs til 1030pm and  be scheduled for 8 hrs starting at 8am the next day, also you can work anywhere from 5 hrs to 8 hrs being part time.

Was good until i was treated like a number,"It was good for at least a month, then I started getting treated like a number. I went through expires when it wasn't my job. I also helped the newer employees when management was too busy. I got injured while working, I put it off for 2 weeks and then I couldn't take the pain no more, so I went to the emergency room. They put me in a stabilizer, Wal-Mart let me keep working, but I kept going to the doctors that walmart sent me to and I missed only two appointments. The doctors told them I went to 2 appointment, I was getting basically jerked around by those doctors and then I was told I couldn't go to work for 2 weeks or if I get my doctors note that I could come back. It took me 3 days to get it, so I took it to them and then they decided to say they don't want me to come back unless my knee is fully healed. I told them it's never going to fully heal because I dont have anymore cartilage in it, but they didn't listen to me and I lost my job because of the work related injury.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Marion, IL",9/27/21,2021,9,27
Proceed at you own risk,"I don't know man, some days are fine, others though... And one day you wake up and realize it sucks. Don't drink the Kool aid, it's an ok company. They don't pay people for what they are worth, and since they restructured, prepare to be over worked and understaffed EVERYDAY.

Physically demanding but good pay,"As an ogp associate they definitely require a ton of manual labor including loading groceries into customer vehicles during all of the elements (snow, rain, extreme heat/cold), lifting heavy item like grills and bags of dog food, and repetitiveness. If you like routines and physical exercise this job is for you. Do not work in this department unless you are willing to lift and carry heavy items on a day to day basis. The pay is good but after a while there is a chance of burn out. The attendance system and leave of absence setup is very strict so if you ever want to miss work make sure you have an excuse or you have paid protected time off (ppto) to cover it.

Not the best. ,"I think it depends on what store you work at. Some have great work culture and morale. The one I worked at bit so much. Some of management was okay, but the majority weren’t so that was the main part that wasn’t great. The actual job is just normal retail. Like I said. Depends on the store, but mine wanted you to do the work of multiple people. The more you worked the more they gave you. I think that’s a lot of retail stores, though. Their attendance is also based on a point system which I didn’t like. ",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Madison, AL",9/26/21,2021,9,26

This job sucks ,They pay pretty average for my area. The management is kinda lazy and they like to blame you for everything.

"Run Don’t Walk, as fast as you can ",Where to start: there is no leadership. Been there 6 years had 4 GM’s. Managers know absolutely nothing and you will be worked to death in mandatory OT. Pay is decent but should be more especially for how many hours you work. Be prepared to work 52 hours a week. A1 shift is the premiere shift and does the most work but gets paid the least out of all 4 shifts. ,2,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Smyrna, DE",9/26/21,2021,9,26

Walmart used to be a great place to work. Now not so much. ,"No one really know what's going on. It's not about the customers any more. It's about staying off reports,  and cheating to do that. They expect one person to do the work of 3 or more depending on the area. There are team leaders with no teams. The teams are so divided that if you needed to hold someone accountable for their actions and they aren't on your team, there's not really anything you can do except get with their leader and that could take days. In my opinion walmart is definitely in trouble. I don't know one happy associate. ",1,Former Employee,Recent Assistant Manager ,"Birmingham, AL",9/26/21,2021,9,26

It's certainly not the best..,"Been working here for 2 weeks and hate it. There's no direction. I get there for my early shift and there's no manager or lead to tell me what's my duty for the day.

Some Employees have the system figured out to do minimal requirements spending the rest of the day in the break room, walking around, trying to make it look as if they are busy.  It has its fun moments when working with the customer. Each employee wants to feel valuable and capable in their job. I just think that Walmart has gotten so big that their entire focus is numbers.  They are loosing focus on the customer and those responsible to ensure they meet the customers needs. In time, if it doesn’t change it will explode in on its self.

Had I been asked nicely, I would have gladly done it, but I have never worked with so many rude people in my life.  There are nice people there, I will admit, I'm having a hard time looking over the shiteheels.  Sitting here debating not going back.

Worst place I've ever been employed in 20+yrs,"They offer no training, raises once per year maybe.  They have no leadership.  Managers sit in their locked offices and constantly pass blame to other members of management.  They are not very accommodating for disabilities other than for senior citizens.  They pride them selves in hiring senior citizens which can't handle the work load, and then they ride the young able bodied personal to a soul sucking level that is nauseating.  The harder you work the more they expect.  The less you work, the less you are noticed and the less management cares what you are doing.  This store is why Amazon is beating Walmart.  Shelves are never properly stocked, and I have found Walmart employees asleep in the bathroom.  Management says we can't do anything about people who have to use the bathroom",1,Current Employee,Deli/inventory control team ,"Paducah, KY",9/25/21,2021,9,25

"Very physical job, horrible management",The job itself was actually pretty hellacious but it was worth the huge paychecks and having four days off every week. Unfortunately horrible management and unrealistic goals line people up to walk out the door. They are offering a $300 a week bonus just to show up and work your scheduled shifts and 50% of the employees call off at least one of the three days every week. This might be right for some people if you're extremely physical and energetic and have no form of ADD. But I can tell you that four out of five people quit within two weeks for a reason.,1,Former Employee,Order Filler/Picker ,"Auburn, IN",9/25/21,2021,9,25

Awful,"I was here for 2.5 years, lots of favoritism. They mess with your fmla and give you points after sedgwick approved them. Caused me to get let go. I had points show up from clear back in June. Had two points when I checked last week and when I looked on Monday I was up to seven. Have heard other employees complain about the same thing that happened to me, but they so far have gotten to keep their jobs. Had two separate managers tell me they would help me move up. The one that is there now decided to bring one of their friends in from another store that was clueless and promote them instead. I used to stay over, come in early and come in on my days off to help the dumpster fire that is OGP. None of it was appreciated. On days when I wasn't able to stay over or didn't want to anymore due to migraines or just no motivation to be there management would get an attitude.

They let many infractions go while at the same time finding excuse to write up any of the older workers or workers who seem to be on a hit list to get rid of.  These are usually workers who have been on the job the longest and obviously make more money.In addition, they have recently given raises on two occasions to bring salaries up for newer workers but nothing for those who have been there for 15 years etc.This store in Arnold, MO is the worst Walmart I know of but have heard other Walmart's are experiencing the same new Walmart Culture which is totally fixated on everything except the employee which is the backbone to the business itself.You get the feeling that maximizing profits is paramount to the owners of Walmart at the expense of their own employees.

Difficult to have days off approved for appointments ,"Very tight attendance policy & difficult to have time off approved for Drs’ appointments, even if requested long before schedule has been made. Most associates are nice & easy to work with, but the few who aren’t are never counseled about their behavior. What you hear upon complaint is “Oh that’s just how he/she is.” That’s not a good reason to be rude or unkind to your co-workers or, even worse, your customers!",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Schertz, TX",9/23/21,2021,9,23
Not why they say they are ,walmart isn't who they say they are. managers are unprofessional and lazy. Denying time off 6 weeks in advance when schedules are made out 3 weeks in advance. Trying to cut LOA early. Yelling to get their point across WALMART IS A SAD COMPANY AND IS FAKE FROM WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LEARN.

"Decent Pay, Extreme stress","Working at Walmart is a big challenge. As a team leader you will be given tasks in all areas of the store on top of your departments. Your coach will constantly pull your employees to other areas of the store to help them complete their duties and to look good for the store lead. Staffing a Walmart has proved almost impossible, most people only last a few months since we are always short staffed (about 80% of the employees we need). The good workers seem to burn out around 6 months and leave, while the people who don't take their job seriously will stay (and continue to under perform). My Walmart won't fire people for calling in sick multiple times a week or coming into work late everyday. Management will make those employees attendance points magically disappear instead of firing them at 5 attendance points. I've never been more stressed out at a job in my life.",2,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Dayton, VA",9/23/21,2021,9,23
It's the people,It ultimately comes down to who you're working under and with. They're the ones who make or break your experience with the company. The time off is pretty easy to get if you've got a good staff. ,3,Current Employee,Digital Personal Shopper ,"Edmond, OK",9/23/21,2021,9,23

Have many departments to workin in case you get tired of one,"My job is cap1, which means we work top stock, what that is, is bringing merchandise down and putting it on the shelves, and updating the sales floor count. I learned that we will be in other departments whether we like it or not. Management doesn’t care about which department you work in, they feel that if they see you without something in your hand, even for a split second or even on your way to take your lunch, they just make you go and work somewhere that has nothing to do with what you are suppose to be doing then, wonder why your own department is such a disaster area. The most enjoyable part is, working with my team at a sense of urgency. (I usually like working by myself) We all get it done quick because it a last minute thing and we want to leave on time and there is no complaining.",2,Current Employee,Early Morning Stocker ,"Atlanta, GA",9/23/21,2021,9,23

Horrible place to work,"Management only cares about you when you make a mistake. We are always understaffed, not only because no one wants to work at Wal-Mart, but because no one in that place knows how to schedule people properly. If you do decide to work there, do not leave your availability open or they will not give a consistent schedule. Have a preferred shift you want to work when you go in for an interview and make sure you tell them what days you want off. If you do not do this, good luck getting anything resembling a consistent schedule after being hired. Do not expect to be trained properly, but don't worry it is not like management cares how well you do your job as long as you smile at customers and eventually learn how to do the bare minimum that the job requires.Oh, and if you have a problem that you need help with my recommendation is to just find a different job instead of trying to approach a manager about it.",2,Current Employee,Walm-Mart Fresh Production Associate ,"Gillette, WY",9/23/21,2021,9,23

","I recently moved about a year ago and needed a job quickly, so I applied to Walmart and they brought me on within a week after coming in to do some paperwork. I was an overnight stocker, and the job itself was not horrible by any means. I've worked hard labor in previous jobs and compared to those, this was easy. My coworkers were great, and they had trained me well enough to where I was doing stocking on my own within a week. Managment was not so great. They were hostile at times and did not seem to care for their employees or their well being. Morale was not great within the workplace, and I only stayed around for about 3 months until I could secure a more lucrative job. You do get a 1 hour unpaid lunch break and two 15 minute breaks.

"Customers are rude, hard work is never recognized and instead just abused. ","Not a good place to work. Worked there for almost 2 years and dreaded coming to work. Managers don't care about you and they will not recognize you if you work hard. Instead they will always take advantage of it and make you work hard while everyone else could slack off. I worked at one of the buesist Walmart in the U.S and we got paid barely above minimum wage.

Our store went from having one in all sections of the store to just four overall cutting the management to a third.

They never made me full time even thought they trusted me to do anything they asked. I was often pulled around the whole store from the truck to the floor and registers. It was an unorganized mess.

The tough part is working with the crazy public. You get to see the worst of the worst people at Walmart and pander to them.

Love my Co workers but hate the entire management system,Hourly workers are great to work with and customers are great as well. You always have amazing co-workers but the management can be lacking at times. Some managers are great but most suck. The few good ones make it worth staying at least for awhile till it turns more worse than it was before. They are the ones that understand the issues at hand and do what they can to help. They expect you to get 10 plus hours of work done and then some after that. When you don't get it done they get angry and use scare tactics to enforce you to get more work done which ends up back firing because they bring down the moral and cause people to call in more frequently. Most people complain that they're going to lose their jobs constantly because of management threatening to fire them if they don't get the work done even if it is 10 plus hours of work and your short staffed. They don't say it but they expect you to miss your required breaks in order to finish. Most people tell me they don't take there last break out of fear of not finishing and getting in trouble. I usually don't take a bathroom break the 9 hours sometimes 9 hours and 20-30 minutes I'm there and cut one of my breaks short usually. Also over time isn't aloud so you have to cut it out during lunch which turns into a constant cycle of barely finishing the work your given or not even finishing it at all resulting in getting you in more trouble usually. It's like this in multiple areas to. Even the elderly workers/ workers that have been with the company for 10-17 years fear losing their jobs. Some even had to quit because management - more...,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Norman, OK",9/19/21,2021,9,19

Pay isn’t the best considering management do not care for employees ,"They only care about money, so if you lock your keys in the car by accident, they will make you wait till your done with your shift and not help. They will fire any despite it being a good reason why that person couldn’t come to work, even if you tell them on the phone they won’t care.

It could've been great,"Walmart isn't an awful company, but the constant restructuring and changes to policies make the job so difficult. The parental leave policy is very unfair, especially to mothers. Unless you are full-time, you're expected to take up to 12 weeks off UNPAID. For fathers, this isn't such a big deal because the time off is not medically necessary. But for mothers who are medically ordered to take at least 6 weeks off, that money is needed. Walmart claims to allow flexible schedules to encourage work-life balance and to work with student schedules- but this is not the case. Management hassles you if your availability does not meet their needs. Also, management also cannot seem to get their story straight on how scheduling works... One manager will say open availability gets you more hours, another manager (and the training at the time) stated those with set availability would be scheduled first and open availability associates would fill in the gaps... All managers should be on the same page with any policies. Paid time off/ PPTO- They reduced how much you earn and if you've been with the company less than 2 years, you earn nothing. One Best Way- what's that?! Sometimes you'll have a store manager that follows it, but the rest of the management goes off the rails. Again- management is never on the same page.

Adults should not be treated like that!!! It's all about making management look good!!!Another thing I didn't like about Wal Mart was that they gave some of us associates a $2 raise, but they took away are quarterly bonuses. You do not get holiday pay and you do not get paid more working on a holiday. They use to have paid holidays but now when they close on Thanksgiving Day & Christmas Day they automatically take 8 hours from your PTO time.

Everyone is in a rush to meet there times so everyone is constantly mad and rushing around ignoring safety and procedure. If you are a new hire and slow people down they will be angry at you and most likely won’t help you (in my experience) Its back breaking labor, every time I come home I can’t barley walk in the door and you only leave when everything is done and most of my shifts I have to do 14 and a half hours. Everything is time down to the way you walk, when you go to the bathroom, get water, literally anything you do that isn’t your job counts against you. The aisle are constantly clogged with people reducing your times and if you are sick you better have PTO other wise you will get a point for as many days as you miss and if you miss all three days you work you get three points and at 5 you are automatically fired.

Trying to get leave for an extended period of time is terrible because you have to file a claim with a separate company. You have to do it months in advance, the communication is horrendous, and they don’t have a clear phone number to call if you have any issues with your case.

Outsourced or Replaced,"Starting in 2014 Walmart started to downsize its store office associates. These jobs were being outsourced to outside compan(y)ies.  As seeing this as a way to save money, Walmart then started remodeling stores to add more self check-outs and removing regular registers so they didn’t need as many cashiers. Now they are doing away with Managers and other positions, giving associates higher stating pay, raises, paying for college, yet only a certain amount can be full time in a store, which means they are the eligible ones for the good health benefits. The part time associates they will work you 34 hours for a couple of weeks and then drop you to 25-30 hours. Just to keep you under 34-35 hours a week. That would put you in to full time.

They do not supply the tools necessary to be successful.

"Fast Paced Job that Goes by Fast, But Easily Taken Advantage of","Overall good place to work, but you do get taken advantage of. Good teamwork as long as you are working with an experience coworker. We got a lot of new people recently before I got fired. Don't go above and beyond, because they might not really notice especially indirect management. I always try not to overwork myself, but it's just a habit of mine. I really put in quality work and rarely took my breaks because I felt bad and I knew we would fall behind if I took my break. At the end of it all  I was fired because I made a mistake and my points went over the attendance policy. I was their best worker, even when ill and with an old wrist injury, but my direct managers could not help me, due to previous issues that were not my fault (I was still held accountable)  and the indirect manager did not care to consider that we were already short staffed and that I didn't really need to be fired. I believe I should have been coached instead. Coaches are rarely around because store manager is having them work at other departments. Team leads tend to be taken away every couple of months also, so the experienced ones get left to take care of the dept. sometimes.

Good pay working in the Deli ,"The manager I had at the Deli was very nice and easy to talk to. I was able to increase my hours whenever I wanted to. PTO was based on the amount of hours worked, I was able to take a day off while working at the store for only 2 months. Lunch breaks are a full hour if needed. I didn't need to interview or get drug tested for this position. ",3,Former Employee,Deli Team Associate ,"Albany, NY",9/15/21,2021,9,15

Pay is not great for the work you do ,It’s not a job that you can have forever. It is not flexible but if you are in need of work they will hire you. Management sucks and the work can be annoying however it’s mainly the pay that make ppl leave,1,Former Employee,Several Positions ,"Houston, TX",9/15/21,2021,9,15

"It's retail, Walmart","Management is subpar, they expect you to be perfect when the rest of the store drops the ball on every facet. Morning crew is alright, you miss out on the highschoolers that don't know what hard work means in any way. High turnover except for the obvious lifers. Even with the new pay raise (yay livable wage, thank you corporate overlords) people wont work for what they're paid. Nobody wants to do the bare minimum, such as picking up product from the floor so its not getting kicked around, or helping customers in the department they're supposed to be working in.",2,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Sioux Falls, SD",9/15/21,2021,9,15
Tries to Keep Employees,"I have no criticism of the Walmart I work at, the managers are fair, the pay is decent for what I do and they gave me the days and hours I requested. The main problem in my department, deli/bakery, is big turnover and chronic absences.  Some employees are unreliable, calling out frequently.  Others take the job expecting to loaf around while everyone else works hard.  This leads to resentment.",4,Current Employee,Fresh Production Associate ,"Clayton, GA",9/15/21,2021,9,15
You don't matter,"As a former Walmart associate I can confidently say that while it's certainly not the worst place to work, you have very little sense of worth and you're easily replaceable even if you've been there a considerable amount of time. Also, there is no such thing as seniority. You're either a favorite of management or you're not and that's pretty much the only way you can move up in the company. If you're fine with staying at the bottom and doing repetitive work day after day then Walmart might suit you. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Huntingdon, PA",9/15/21,2021,9,15
It's alright,Wasn't too bad for something temporary. Don't go in there if you have expectations of promotion or raises. Can get pretty boring at times but the coworkers make it alright.,3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Wichita, KS",9/15/21,2021,9,15
1/10 would not recommend ,"They work you like a dog. If you're a hardworker, they will absolutely take advantage of you. Oftentimes I found myself doing a manager's job as a sales associate. I consistently had to run FIVE departments all by myself, meanwhile most of management walked around doing nothing. Management couldn't finish their duties or didn't want to so they'd all just pile it on me. And if i didn't finish an assignment one of them gave me, they'd reem me, despite the fact that i was running 5 departments by myself on top of having assignments from 4 different managers. Expectations were absolutely unrealistic. There was only one good manager there, and he was a support manager. He would help me when he could and was the nicest person I've ever met. Scheduling is inconsistent, you could have 40 hours one week, and 4 the next. Benefits are awful, the only good one was vision, and they will average your hours out so you don't qualify for health insurance, even though you've worked there for years. A majority of the staff is toxic, with a few gems. ",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Virginia,9/15/21,2021,9,15
Not great ,Would only work there if I had to. Walmart does not care about you as an employee or human at all.

It’s okay,"I really enjoyed the job when I first started in 2018. Overtime I did notice how unorganized, and unprofessional Walmart is. Walmart used a point system.  They make it such an issue to remove a point, (like if you came in early for your supervisor, the system will think you didn’t come for your original shift.) they make you go through these loops. Management themselves get a bonus for cutting our hours; this happens 1-2 a year. The pay is decent and every once in a while we get bonuses but bonuses are based off attendance points. The low your points, the higher the bonus. If you go over 5 points you’re fired. ",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Atlanta, GA",9/15/21,2021,9,15

Decent training and very productive place to work,It’s an okay job for growth. Low pay but you get to work from home. The training is 5 weeks. They help you preform your job but it’s hard to retain the knowledge because they  let you leave training without going through all the necessary applications to do your job,5,Current Employee,Benefits Specialist ,Remote,9/15/21,2021,9,15
Easy but stressful,"Since i did online grocery, it was pretty easy.

Could find better work,"I really enjoyed my job in maintenance when I started out but my manager mad me do EVERYBODY'S jobs. I didn't get paid nearly enough, was injured on the job due to faulty equipment that the manager knew about and still made me use. And was also asked to work holidays for bonus pay, but when payday came I made nothing because I wasn't passed my probationary period.

"Benefits were good, everything else was a joke","I worked with the company for eight years, so I saw a lot of turnover, and a lot of change. I felt the benefits were good, but the pay was very low for the work they wanted. Management didn’t really have anyone’s back, so if a customer was irate or unruly, it was usually just me being left to deal with it, unless it got really out of hand. I was trained in a lot of different jobs, but they didn’t want to promote me because they didn’t want to train someone else in my job. Lack of positive feedback, or even constructive criticism, so most of my fellow employees didn’t strive for better. The constant restructuring made people fear for their jobs, which would be eliminated but then brought back a year later. The company only cares about money, definitely not a family environment. Most of the time it felt like I was back in high school with the amount of drama and favoritism that was allowed. When concerns were raised to management, nothing was ever done.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Overnight Stocker ,"Medford, OR",9/14/21,2021,9,14
Not for part timers,"Working at Walmart was OK. I love my team however I went from having  32 hr work weeks to 8 hours.

Starting pay $15/hour!The management at my store has unrealistic expectations. Just about every night I am given 10-12 hours of freight to work during my 8 hour shift. The GM expects the freight to get done, top stock to be worked, the entire department/departments zoned, returns to be returned to their departments, trash to be thrown, and overstock to be binned. Things get added every day. If they can see you can manage your workload, they will add more and more until it's too much. It isn't uncommon for people to quit on their first day.

Looking back at all the mental and physical damage it caused me I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy. But if you really dislike someone and really want them to suffer. Getting them a job at the dc is great way to make it happen. Everyone there hated their job with a passion but some were too prideful to admit it. Can’t be a big shot about making good money if you hate your job so they pretend to like it while looking for any job possible that they think they can justify leaving for.

Not my worst job ,"I quite enjoyed working at Walmart, my coworkers were fantastic and while reluctant they moved me to a position where I could actually thrive. The pay was great and something I miss dearly. The only reason I left was because I moved 3 hours away. Be warned though, their point system is strict and somewhat unfair as you can’t bring in a doctor’s note (as someone with a chronic illness it was a problem) and because I forgot to officially state that I quit (I got busy with the move and I ended up not calling) I ended up getting a 0.16 cent paycheck when it should’ve been close to 200 and that went unresolved so I basically worked for free my last week.

Protect Your Sanity - Find Somewhere Else to Work,"If you are looking for a workplace that cares about the employees... you should look somewhere else. If you are a college student... RUN! Management will act as though they care that you are pursing your education. They will lie and tell you that they will work around your school schedule. However, as soon as you let them know that you have to have a certain amount of days off for school activities, they have an issue. The leadership/management is beyond horrible. There is no positive communication between the team leads. They constantly degrade one another. They don't seem to realize that bad management affects the entire team... to the point where no one wants to work with them because they have negative attitudes. They try to degrade and talk to you like you are a child... and then get mad when you stand your ground and confront them about it. It's a way to talk to someone. They fail to realize that everyone is an adult and you should treat people as such. There is a lot of unnecessary micro-management. Everyone wants to be the boss and it causes confusion and frustration with other team members. The team leads and management constantly want you to pick up the slack for others and then get mad when you don't complete your own tasks. This place is a constant headache.

It's walmart.,"Walmart is the biggest retail chain in the US, maybe the world (haven't checked). It has a high customer flow, even in the ""low traffic"" stores. 7000 pieces of freight on average (varies by store) gets shipped to the store daily and you can expect customers to be in every aisle. I would recommend working at a different retail store. Walmart is very, very busy and home office makes it so every store runs a skeleton crew. They reduced the amount of managers and now are stating all employees are mini department managers. For context, I've worked at walmart several times, my most recent stint was 2020 and my s/o still works at walmart. He is at his 4th store since we've moved cross country a couple times.It's very common to be talked to about productivity if you can't stock 4 pallets in 2 hours by yourself. The size of a pallet doesn't matter, a half pallet and a 6 foot tall pallet are expected to have the same completion time. Similarly, a box with 4 of the same lipstick in it is expected the same stocking time as a box with a hundred different individual makeups. And while there are freight times, they don't actually matter because there's not enough people scheduled to get it done but it has to be done regardless. Now, I'm not saying that a specific location or manager is the problem, I'm saying that the overall company policy on how many people should be scheduled and how long something should take is borked. And they can and will write you up for it. As someone who was pulled into the office and talked to about productivity for not completing 10 hours of freight in a 8 - more...",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Clanton, AL",9/12/21,2021,9,12

Wonderful... If you have the right management,"I love working at Walmart. There's always something to do and never any downtime. I think in general, most employees do a good job and want to see their areas succeed. I think the only downside is when there is someone in a position of authority that has lost their drive to succeed. If you end up working for someone like this, it's hard to stay motivated to do well. Management will make or break your experience working at Walmart. I would suggest asking questions on your interview to determine where you want to work and who you want to work for. Most likely they will need people, so you might want to decide where you want to work before accepting the position that they want you to take.

Repetative work but not physically taxing.,"As long as all employees of your department are present for the shift, you should have an easy time. Most days will be uneventful and you often will be chosen for the same task multiple times per week regardless on personal preference.A typical day would begin with the all maintenance associates preforming a ""safety sweep"" of different departments, in which you are required to remove products from the floors and use a dust mop to remove debris. Then the associate who was chosen to use the floor scrubber sets out to begin filling and operating the machine. The remaining associates either split to join the crew who strips and waxes floors, or does general store cleaning (such as cleaning restrooms, the vestibules,  the break room and offices, and  making cardboard bales). Depending on the store itself, sometimes the associate doing the of daily cleaning tasks has to spend half of their shift buffing the floors after they have been scrubbed. At the end of the shift the associates in maintenance preform a final ""safety sweep"" to prepare the store for its morning shift crew and customers.The worst you will have to do is use a propane floor buffer, which could possibly cause hearing damage without headphones. The buffer also vibrates, so it will leave a lingering tingling sensation in your arms when you stop. Often times you also end up breathing in some of the exhaust during work or propane itself after you unscrew the tank.The most preferential task is waxing and stripping the floors, as they often do not require you to physically exert much effort and have long drying times - more...",2,Former Employee,Walmart maintenance ,"Murray, KY",9/12/21,2021,9,12

Ever since I started working at my store 8 months ago, 30 people quit in the front. Of those 30 some were csms and a manager.

On Christmas eve the head of the store locked the doors and wouldn't let anyone leave, even if there shift was over, until all the returns had been put away! Some people were over 2 hours late returning home.  In the deli there was a bath with special soap we should have been able to use to soak the extremely oily and grimy cookware from the rotisserie but the manager wouldn't allow it because ""we'd just throw everything in"", so we had to work much much harder to get thing to look clean but they wouldn't really BE clean.

Over Stressed Lack of Leadership Direction ,"Management insists in a work timeline for the role I'm in but gives unrealistic time frames and no help or clear concise direction from leadership.

"Love the job, hate the management","The entire store is understaffed and ODP’s overloaded with orders; they’d still try to steal us to help stock other departments, which isn’t an issue if we’re done, but when there’s basically ten people to pick 6k items first thing in the morning and they want to take half of them? Almost never have a team lead in the morning too so you wouldn’t have anyone to tell them no. We wouldn’t even get the employees back some times and we’d be drowning with the drops that would come in. Even when retaining our pickers, we’d still fall behind because it’s just too many orders and no one higher up seemed to give a single care about it and chalk it up to us being lazy. The SECOND we’re an inch ahead, they love to pull us to stock, and then act surprised when we fall behind again. I loved the our department’s team leads, all things considered, but it was immensely frustrating to be lowkey expected to take 30 minute lunches and then asked to stay late. If you work ODP, be prepared for a majority of the store to hate you for no real reason. It’s everyone’s favorite scapegoat. Regardless, it’s a job at Walmart, so your managers probably aren’t going to care about you. The pay is great but genuinely isn’t worth the stress a majority of the time.",3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Meridian, ID",9/9/21,2021,9,9

Good pay/ management never on the same page,It’s a good job with good pay if you are good at dealing with the good and bad people that come in. They have good benefits if your able to get on full time.

Just No,"Most of the faults in the day to day at Walmart come down to the fact that it is a retail position and those are notoriously unpleasant jobs to work.

They don’t offer paid holidays, or sick pay, you have to earn pto, but they will give you “occurrences “ when you take time off.  So make sure it’s approved. I have watched so called “team leads” giggling like little boys in the back with young girls who are not dressed in Walmart specified clothing. I’m sure belly shirts are not standard.

Then after unloading we had to stock pets, food, paper, beverages, and hba items that came off the truck. All of this we had to complete within 7 hours.

You will work long 12s on your feet with high levels of physical labor and some stress to meet your loading times. You get a break about every 3-4 hours and will receive anywhere from 1-4 lanes to manage depending on your level of experience, knowledge, and how much freight is coming into the warehouse that day. Management was very nice, understanding, and a great resource for guidance on the job or even seeking further positions. The most enjoyable part of the job was the good pay and the people you work with are usually helpful and great to be around. Easy to make friends and connections.

Fair pay for slave labor,"Working at a Wal-Mart distribution center will give you competitive pay and benefits. You will work long, and hard for it. Daily individual work assignments will not adjust for changing freight flow, so you may often end up with an unreasonable workload with no leniency.Mandatory overtime will exist almost every week of the year. There is zero work-life balance. You will be told while clocking out that you must work overtime tomorrow morning. You may work 60 hour weeks for months at a time. Your hours may be cut in half without prior warning.Upper management is comically arbitrary. You will arrive for forced overtime to replace several people having their work hours cut. New workplace rules will be rotated in and out monthly without your input. Most of my direct supervisors have been great people, but they're rotated out often, and have no real power. They are the voice of upper management micromanaging everything in arbitrary, often senseless ways.When I began 7 years ago, it was a great job in all aspects.

Wonderful employees and 1 hour lunch some lunches provided on holidays ,The job is very stressful and the pay is not worth the stress. The management jobs are to demanding and unrealistic on the amount of time to complete. 1 person doing the job of at least 2 people. Being responsible and owning things you have no control over and to many hands in the pot. To much of fudging papers to make everything look good and acting like the store is doing better than it really is. The pay scale makes no sense as far as what position get paid the amounts based on the level of work and stress. For example someone with no stress gets paid the same as someone with the stress of running almost the whole store operations. While someone that is stocking the shelves and pushing carts gets paid way less than them. ,5,Former Employee,HR ,"Fort Worth, TX",9/8/21,2021,9,8

I would work for Walmart again. Just not as a cashier. ,"I would say that I had a fair experience working at Walmart. I do have a few points that I want to make about working there for those who are thinking about applying for the position of a Cashier. Working as a cashier at Walmart is a very demanding and stressful job at times. Especially when our department was short staffed or when the holidays rolled around. When either of those incidents happened, the WHOLE department went down in flames. If we were short staffed, we had to spread ourselves thin in order to provide the same quality service that customers expect from us. When customers don't get what they want, we tend to be the ones who they take it out on. The cashiers and the managers would get all types of unpleasant comments of disapproval for doing the best they can to meet the customer's needs and it not being enough. As far as management is concerned, I would say that I was treated fairly by management and was supported when I needed assistance. I just had to get used to my different team member's work styles. I really wish that Walmart would change their attendance policy. That is my main complaint about working there and feel that that is the reason why their retention rate for employees is so low. I feel like their policy is unrealistic and doesn't show an understanding of the fact that life happens and we have a life outside of working there. People were constantly stressed out and praying that their employment didn't get terminated because they surpassed the maximum point accumulation. Especially for those who had kids, and sick relatives that were in their care. - more...",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"West Palm Beach, FL",9/7/21,2021,9,7

",4,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 1 and Bakery Associate ,"Leesville, LA",9/7/21,2021,9,7
Could be better,Schedule is not very flexible for newer employers. Wage needs to be more competitive. Management should be promoted from the right departments for the same instead of choosing any random person for that task. Better HR practices need to be made who actually help you instead of being the company's pet. Company does support you when it needs you too and your work life would depend on how your management is.

Good job fresh out of highschool. Not ideal for a long term career.,"Management typically is never concerned with the physical or mental wellbeing of the associates depsite what they claim. All of the outgoing managers that everyone seems to enjoy being around are 9 times out of 10 driven out by the store manager because of her unrealistic standards and goals, constantly adding on to the pressure put on to the managers, which gets pushed down to the associates, thus making it unpleasant for everyone. Since walmart is constantly getting more and more sales, the store is, in result, getting more and more freight orders thus less room to store overstock. This issue is not being addressed in any ideal way, resulting in the same overstock freight to be run every single day until it all goes on to the shelves. The backroom is CONSTANTLY cramped and full because of the amount of freight they have, making it increasingly difficult to work in. No efforts are being made to find a better way to organize the freight, make more room or anything to make the lives of the associates and customers easier. It has reached the point that the store manager does not show any concern to whether or not the One Best Way is being followed. Nothing is done the way it should be done.

"Hard work, mediocre pay","Held three positions while I worked at Walmart and they all sucked in their own ways. As an associate, if you’re a hard worker, management will give you most of the work/the hardest tasks and your lazy coworkers will skate by.As a supervisor, new hires are often positive and hard working but the Walmart environment (plus workers who’ve been there longer) will soon discourage any of that. You’ll have to pick up the slack if your team doesn’t get things done, which management will yell at you for.And you can’t even fault the lower workers that much because management expects you to work yourselves to death, getting jobs done in half the time that require double the people. Of course they’d feel overworked and under appreciated.I would work so hard that I’d leave work limping. I often cried after work, sometimes at work in the bathroom. Covid was an especially terrible time and we all felt even less appreciated.*IF* you manage to find yourself working at a Walmart that isn’t understaffed and the management is actually supportive, stay and move up, by all means. But if your Walmart sucks, don’t think for a minute that it will improve.

Lack of leadership.,"Walmart overnight stocking was something I enjoyed.  It was very fast paced and they always asked for 120% performance minimum.  However, there were senior co-workers that were up in age, they couldn't move as fast as they use to.  On top of that Walmart shifted most responsibilities on overnight.  We were also understaffed.  No matter how big the freight was, it was expected to be finished.  Management never tried to balance out the production by moving people around knowing that we were not stationed to be in one certain area.  They just kept saying we needed to move faster and getting the same results.  They didn't change it until I tried to transfer to Dallas.  The transfer didn't go through because the two Walmarts couldn't get in touch with each other.  No one answered the phone, and no one was trying but me.

They would give me 4 hour shifts during the week, and for the whole weekend Friday, Saturday and Sunday i was scheduled too work 8 hour shifts, leaving me too not have quality time with family/friends let alone have a life outside of work. $12 an hour, being paid bi weekly, being a cashier is an obstacle and your checks are really not that good. Management there is by far out of line, they don’t care about you. All they care about it money, if you take a sick day you’ll get pointed immediately.

Great job if you like repetition.,"I worked as a cashier for 2 years, and I can confidently say that it was the best job I've personally had. The work isn't hard at all, though, can be stressful if you're doing front end work like cashiering. I've worked at multiple stores, and management and work environment can vary from store to store. You hear horror stories about working at Walmart, but I've never experienced them. However, I have met rude and poor managers that I believe could make those stories real. Thankfully, transferring to another store isn't too difficult, though with the caveat that you have to work at a location for at least 6 months before you can transfer. The same applies for benefits, so if you need health insurance immediately, you'll have to stick around for a while. I personally really liked working at my store, but there isn't much variety in a work day. Every day is the same thing, over and over.

It's walmart. make it good or make it bad,"There is a lot to say about Walmart. They hire everyone and anyone. The pay is good. It's been above minimum wage for the last five years or so and was ahead of the game in that sense. It's the only job i personally know of that you can work part time at 18 and get paid time off and bonuses. It was easy work, but just like any retail job, it was draining. The freight never ends and customers can be horrid. At the end of the day, if you go to work expecting to actually work and find people you enjoy talking to, then it's not so bad and it's what you make of it.

Always understaffed and overworked,"While Walmart offers good benefits and good pay, it is almost not worth it because they are always lacking staff.

Easy job but it was a mess,"I worked as a personal shopper for a couple of months and it was a fairly easy job with a lot of hours. Most of the time you'll be doing your own thing and you'd rarely get questions from customers other than locations for certain items which you could look up on your phone if you don't know. You would also get breaks pretty often which was nice. Unfortunately a lot of the time orders would start piling up and we'd be in a huge rush to finish them because we'd be short staffed on certain days while on others we finished too early and then didn't have much to do. Working in the back preparing orders wasn't any better. Certain parts of the orders would often go missing and it was hard looking for them when there was so many people back there with so little space. One other thing I remember being a problem was the lack of decent carts. The people who had an earlier shift always got the light ones which were super easy to push around and made your job way easier, there were others who were a little bigger and heavier which were bearable but it could take a toll on you on a long shift (although I only had this problem when starting out), but a lot of the time we wouldn't even have enough carts for all of the people that were working that day. The management was good, they would answer any of your questions and help out sometimes but one thing I did notice was that they either didn't notice that certain people were just plain lazy or they turned a blind eye to it but not with others. It felt like there was some favoritism there. Overall it was a decent job where if you keep to yourself - more...",3,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Tucson, AZ",9/4/21,2021,9,4

When you do everything right, your wrong.  If your in the sights at all of management, prepare to be yelled at while they unload their work stress on you. They were so understaffed that all management would pile more work load on everyone left that they could handle. Management finds ways to jam you up, even if you smile everyday. It doesn’t matter. Don’t rely on this place if you have a family to support. Unless you walk in with a bad attitude and keep it, they will find a way to get rid of you for being positive.

overnight stocking nightmare,"a typical day of work would be getting temp checked when entering, then going back to find out that all the devices to find products for stocking were checked out and the necessary job tools are not available to get the job done, management gets mad when you have an impossible work load to do and many more. The overnight shift is consistently 20-25 people short because turnover is I believe 85 percent or so. Management constantly tells us that the store is 100 hours over every couple weeks. How does that makes sense? I thought the store was short handed. where is the money going and who is lying?

If you have another job (s) , they say it's not Walmart's fault and they expect you to quit it so you can work their hours.

They cannot keep associates, most people quick after a good solid week or so, only a few stay. They show favoritisms to some associates, they have their least favorite associates do the hard work.

"No fun, too much favoritism ","There are some managers that would work with you if there are personal issues in your life, not the company. They expect you to attend to their needs, not yours, and take away the benefits that can establish a better life. They don’t wanna hire you back because of personal problems surrounding in your life. They just kick you to the curb to find someone else to fire in the future. They pick their favorites and treat the workers like they don’t exist. 20 year associate and when thinks fall apart in your life, you’re gone. Not worth it.

The company’s the problem. They put programs in to effect to cut payroll costs but chasing away experienced help. Then can’t fill positions that have been vacated. They like to say they are raising wages. But only for some. All your money comes at the front end when your are hired. Raises are low or nonexistent.

Your customers become your good friends . It seems to be changing throughout the past 2 years. It's become less personal. Personally when you see a regular customer,and you just know your probably the only one that spoken to them and really cared. That to me is the most rewarding feeling.Regardless of company expectations, that should never change . Showing the customer your appreciation and respect . I feel it's moving away from that. More than likely bc of the hiring of young kids. Maybe a moral assessment taken everytime you watch the shooter video,Honestly I'm trying to have a complaint ,but all I have are wonderful blessed days. overall I say that Wal-Mart is the best job I've had.

They'd give you about two days of training and then throw you in the deep end with no help at all, not even someone there in case you have questions. I worked the service desk and the lines would be to the door. The service desk gets paid $12 an hour while stockers get paid $15. The cashier's bring all full carts up there so we'd have to sort and go through them when it wasn't even our job. The computers hardly ever worked.

Productive Operations,"During my short tenure , I didn't feel connected due to multiple matters. Mixed thoughts on leadership direction & acceptance.

"Coworkers are generally great, Management sucks, benefits are okay, overall terrible","Overall, i didn't enjoy my time here.

Don’t work here,This company cares nothing for its employees. Have totally unrealistic demands on employees. They expect brand new employees to perform at the same level as veteran employees.

Essential to Disposable ,"Being called an essential worker in 2020 , to getting poorly treated after having covid from said job. The knowledge that 13 hourly is barely enough for all We do holds heavy in my opinion of this company. Only 4 unpaid sick days. One PTO week a year. Insane lack of support for disabled associates ",1,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Navarre, FL",8/30/21,2021,8,30
It’s boring and repetitive ,It’s not terrible in the beginning. But once you’ve been there awhile it just becomes repetitive and you don’t feel appreciated at all. They are very under staffed and can’t keep anyone for very long.,2,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Neenah, WI",8/30/21,2021,8,30
It's not bad as long as you have a good direct manager,"Store management, market management, and corporate management are only out to help themselfs for the most part. You might get lucky and find that one in a million manager that cares and makes all the rest bearable, but generally you will be stuck at the same job for decades.

day goes by fast because you are always busy.,Management is always working beside you if you get blasted with work.  They are always there if you need help.

Horrible ,"The worst job you can ever get m. You’re replaceable; They will treat you as such. They have said things to me like, “Do you know how many ppl apply for this job a day ?” Really poor professionalism. It’s like high school honestly. Ppl say mean things about you behind your back. Really a low vibrational setting. Pay is awful. No hours are available. PTO is awful as well. & you only get a 10% discount on things that’s it!  You don’t get your brakes on time. You’d be in your 5th hour without a lunch break. ",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Palmdale, CA",8/30/21,2021,8,30

Very friendly co workers ,A typical night at Walmart first consisted of a 10 PM meeting. At that time you were assigned an aisle to work a freight pallet. Sometimes you would have a lot to stock and other times it would not be as much. Then there were scheduled break times and scheduled lunches. At the end of the shifts the last hour was spent zoning. ,5,Former Employee,Bakery/Deli Associate ,"Lebanon, VA",8/30/21,2021,8,30

It’s a good place to work if you desperately need a job. ,"You’re guaranteed a job at Walmart, which is good, but a some store locations it’s hard to advance to higher positions without knowing someone. Training is mediocre and for what the front end has to put up with: customers, not so great management, unreliable associates, it’s not worth $11 an hour.

Walmart is a corporation ,"I like working for Walmart. It has insurance with 401k&perks like the discount. The thing is that the corporate structure doesn’t allow for individual growth as much as I would like. I have a bachelors degree and speak 2 languages, which didn’t affect my pay at all. I get paid the same as some of the 18 yr olds with no experience. This is my qualm with the corporate structure. I feel that my skill set, although advanced as it is with many years of customer service experience, is treated as disposable.

Productive,"Working at Walmart was a eye opener, started out good but as time past you see and learn alot, most importantly make sure you put days you can not work if you don't you will work harder than you suppose to work, Trust yourself only and make sure you cover yourself, if not you will be thrown to the wolves (Mangers, Shift Leads whoever over you).

Typical retail job with decent benefits,"Typical retail job that has drama among workers and middle management that are completely out of touch with their employees. The benefits are pretty decent and the pay can vary from decent to terrible depending on what your job is.The job isn’t hard and you’re always busy. The customers can vary from pleasant to absolutely rude, but you get used to dealing with them.

Overworked & underpaid as usual ,"Been working at this specific store for 3 years (2 yrs as an hourly manager,) my store was always considered one of the nicer store in our market. Salaried management is ok, only really care about themselves at the end of the day, you can go to them with questions and concerns but they don’t strive to make a difference within their associates, just looking to take credit for what they delegate to their people but never getting their hands dirty. They’ll always ask their people to learn everything on the floor but won’t take the extra step to teach them or do it themselves. Company overall is just worried about how much money they can make off of the people, not thinking about the expense of their well-being. I’ve met a lot of great people working here but underpaid and overworked is the usual complaints. ",3,Current Employee,Front End Team Lead ,"Buda, TX",8/29/21,2021,8,29

Horrible,"Management only cares about their numbers so they get a bigger bonus at the end of the year and they don't care how bad they railroad the employees to get it by running way understaffed and running more cases per man hour than they should just to further boost their numbers. The more cases they ship out in the least amount of hours with the least amount of employees makes their productivity look way better than what it should be just so they get a better bonus and in turn the employees lose out on money due to not getting as many hours in a work week and the employees bonus is a $60 bonus that is taxed separately so it comes out to be like $37 or something like that while managers and supervisors get thousands of dollar bonuses and they just get bigger the further up you go in management, when they wouldn't even receive a nickel if it wasn't for the employees they totally crapped on in order to get it. Feel free to work there if you love being lied to and treated like garbage just so you can get railroaded over even more and they can get a bigger bonus. That's all they care about and they don't care who quits cause they have a stack of applications as tall as the sky because people don't know what its like to work for the gestapo",1,Former Employee,Laborer ,"Woodland, PA",8/29/21,2021,8,29

Refuses to Work with School Schedule,"Working at Walmart in a college town, I expected the managers to respect my class schedule and the hours of availability I had posted.

Good place to work and a bad place to work.,"I’ve worked at Walmart twice now and both times were completely different. The very first Walmart I worked for happened to be beyond an organized and truly unprofessional. There was minimal training and management never cared to help nor assist in training. Personnel was nowhere to be found. And the store was always shorthanded on staff. My second time working at Walmart, a different Walmart. Things were the complete opposite management cared, personnel was available, the store was always staffed. Unfortunately in the part of the store where I worked I worked alone. The most enjoyable part about working for Walmart was the benefits and everything I was able to accomplish while working for the company.

It's pretty bad most of the time,"I gave this 4 stars because it's 100% dependent on the store. My store had great managers up until the time I left because they started micromanaging even though we had phenomenal stats with wait time, issues with pick up, etc. The new ""team lead"" system sucks since management decided to give the OGP team a team lead who never had done OGP before. PPTO is the best since it accures since day 1 but u access it day 90 and you don't have to get permission to use it so you can leave mid day without any issues, the attendance system is really relaxed as long as you have basic work ethic and show up for your shifts (10 tardies or 5 call offs unless it's a holiday, and the point disappears after 6 months). The pay was raised and it's alright. 10% discount is actually trash but Black Friday you get access to a 23.5% off one time your entire transaction. Every 6 hour+ shift you get 2x15 minute paid breaks + 30-1 hr lunch (up to u to decide how much u want). Also they pretty much let you chose when you want to take a break/when you want lunch unless it's really busyThe job is really fast paced usually during the start of the hour when deliveries come in and management opens up the gates to how many orders can happen in an hour and they'll make the hourly reservations go up to 35 so they can boost their sales but ends up putting you in an overworked position. Management does mass firing and during off season (March-September) they'll just make you take in so much work.The schedule is based around your availability and they do a really good job of making sure if you want 20 hours they'll - more...",3,Former Employee,Digital e-Commerce Shopper ,"Chicago, IL",8/28/21,2021,8,28

The 401k is good though…they match up to 6%. The other issue I have is the sheer scale of Walmart. There are WAY too many tools, sites, resources to navigate.

The school program that's in place for employees ,It could be a great company to work for if the management team was better and they didn't show so much favortism.

Great to start but not long term,"Started off enjoyable, Walmart the company itself is good.I was with the company 15 years. I’ve been noticing if you make it past the 10 year mark it seems like they look for anything to get rid of you. It’s just the people that work there that can make it uncomfortable. Whenever seeking promotion I recommend transferring to another store. Management needs training with communication they talk too rude especially on the radio I couldn’t stand my ear piece some managers constantly yell into the radio. If you have any problems I highly suggest using open door policy. ",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager/ Digital Team Lead ,"Dallas, TX",8/27/21,2021,8,27

Incredibly stressful,"The pharmacy is always short staffed. The training is almost non-existent, which makes extra work and stress for the seasoned employees.  The scheduling is erratic and unfair.

"Easy job, lots of deadlines","A typical 8 hour shift would consist of you filling about 10-12 batches of orders depending on the sizes. It's non stop on your feet and walking, I never got to sit down and take a break which was the hardest part for me. It was easy and simple to just shop all day. The team leads were nice, but it every day was crazy hectic and stressful because of how many orders and deadlines there were. Upper management is obsessed with the stats and numbers of the job, and not all of the number are our fault due to stocking issues, computer problems, etc. Liked working there, but couldn't handle to pain in my feet.",4,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Orem, UT",8/27/21,2021,8,27

Worst workplace ,The pay isn’t fair whatsoever. A cashier makes less than anyone starting out and they’re the ones who deal with the most stuff. I’ve been here for a little over three months and got moved to a different part of the store. A promotion basically but there is no pay raise. I was told we only get a 2% raise annually so if you do a great job you won’t get what you are worth. I was only told some people can be there for 5+ years and barely get a raise. I’m currently going to college and the manager in charge of me will not give me the days off that I need. Managers are two faced and can treat you like absolute garbage. They do not handle things well. Some employees in my department will take an extra 15 minutes on their 15 minute break and no one will say anything. There’s a 5 point system but people always call in and you can’t help but wonder how they’re still even employed. Employees who have been there for a while will also treat you like garbage. We are so short staffed it’s ridiculous. ,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Iola, KS",8/27/21,2021,8,27
I really enjoyed the schedule I had 312 hour shifts a week and that allowed me to still take care of my children and have time at home with my family.,Loved this job and was so sad to leave it but I was pregnant with my youngest and had health problems that became a safety concern. The management at the location that I was at was not very good they were I’m not very positive managers and we had a lot of different ones a short period of time. I mainly just kept my head down and did my work I was always leaving very sore but feeling accomplished it was easy to go in and get my stuff done and just go home but having 312s as my shift affected the rest of my life in such a positive way while still getting good pay.

Keep you on your feet.,It’s started off fun like any other new job will be but after a while it’s like the team leaders of course have favoritism. Then they would have a meeting with the store manager to see how we did overnight crew of course some days will be great then they will give us the results at night and would say we absolutely did horrible.

Terrible company,Walmart is not a good place to work unless you are an assistant manager. Starting pay is not very good for the amount of work required.

"Average grocery store, but unrealistic expectations ","I work on CAP 2 Stocker full time, which means we have to unload a truck starting at 2pm, everyone has to rush and sort everything as quickly as possible from stuff as small as a box of crayons, to huge grills and things of cat litter. Usually we finish at 4:30pm or 5pm and there is no AC. After that we stock shelves with a time we are required to do it in, otherwise our supervisor and management will start to get irritated, to the point you can be ""coached"", which are like strikes, 3 strikes and you're out. However, management and some supervisors hand them out like candy, to the point where several of my team members got coached for taking an extra 3-5 minute break.

"They only care about production, not employee well being. ","I worked here for almost 2 years and it absolutely sucked for the most part.

They expect you to know how to do the job perfectly with little to no help at all for months before your actual training. Even after I was trained for my new role, I got back to my home store and they were against doing almost everything that are walmart’s actual standards. They overwork you and have extremely high expectations while simultaneously treating you and talking to you like garbage. I’ve had several mental breakdowns in the bathroom and they do not care AT ALL. This is the most toxic work environment that I have ever worked in honestly..

Its who you know at the store I work they talk to you any kind of way, it's dreading. They say some to the ones they want to while others still do as they want. No help you basically on your own because the head managers don't know anything but wants you to do all these positions with less pay",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Columbus, MS",8/26/21,2021,8,26
It's ok ,They push you too much. You have to play the corporate games to move up. Management is not friendly.  They think we can work like robots. I will never work there again,4,Former Employee,Cap team 2 ,"Clinton Township, MI",8/26/21,2021,8,26
Worst management I ever worked for.,"Team leaders yell at workers the whole shift. They don't tell you when hired you get no sick days, if you call in sick 5 times in a 6 month period they fire you.",1,Former Employee,Night Stocker ,"North Highlands, CA",8/26/21,2021,8,26
Very productive ,If you like a job that keeps you busy but does not work with you for your life situations.  Then this is the job for you. Not really a good place to work.,3,Former Employee,Department manager of electronics ,"Blair, NE",8/26/21,2021,8,26
Great Pay = Long hours ,Great place to work for but long hours in order to get the job done especially if you have visitors. Walmart is what you make of it. If you suit up and show up you can definitely move up in the company with the opportunity to transfer almost anywhere in the country. ,5,Current Employee,Front End Coach ,"Indio, CA",8/26/21,2021,8,26
Productive and fun,When I first started there it was like family. The management team really did follow Sam Walton beliefs threat employees right and they will reward with hard work. ,4,Former Employee,Claims Manager ,"Marcy, NY",8/26/21,2021,8,26
Quick to advance but horrible work life balance,Pay is good but once you switch from hourly to salary your hours go from 40 up to 60-70 and eventually outrun your hourly rates if you calculate it out.,3,Former Employee,ASM ,"Plaquemines Parish, LA",8/26/21,2021,8,26
Good benefits but poor work/life balance,Benefits are great and easy to advance to higher positions but once you switch from hourly to salary your hours go up to 60-70/week depending on the condition of your store.  Bonuses are 25% of your salary but only if your store meets sales thresholds.  Company often implements massive changes with little to no training and expects the job to be done with fewer people given more responsibilities.  Add on top of this the very generous LOA and COVID policies you end up with high absences on teams and can't replace missing associates while demand skyrockets.,3,Current Employee,Coach ,"Baton Rouge, LA",8/26/21,2021,8,26
Very tough and hard to get used to ,Tough and hard to get used to and was a lot easier after the first couple of weeks when I got everything down. I was very used to everything after I was there for a while ,3,Former Employee,STOCKER WALMART ,"Yukon, OK",8/26/21,2021,8,26
Favoritism by managers ,Well for me Walmart was a fun place to work with friends but if you didn’t kiss up to management well sorry you aren’t going far in this company well at least at my store. Only the favorites were ever considered for promotion and if the supervisors don’t like you for whatever reason maybe they think you’re weird or something I don’t know any reason they will give you hard task with impossible time limits to do it in hopes you don’t finish and they Write you up for “lack of productivity” and they will keep doing this until you are gone.so I suggest not looking at someone the wrong way but if you can suck up to the right people you might do well just remember favoritism is the key to this place maybe get in a secret relationship with a manager if you want to that will get you above your station real quick well I’m kidding don’t do that but at my specific store it has worked…Good luck,3,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Jasper, AL",8/26/21,2021,8,26
Okay place,"It was a steady pay check to make ends meet and take care of my daughter. The discount program help during the holidays.

A lot of hard work for sometimes little to no rewards,"Retail Pharmacy is hard- don't let anyone tell you otherwise. If you want to work hard and like a challenge then retail is for you. If you expect everything to be handed to you and always told thank you and how good a job you're doing... Well, this might not be the career for you. The patients and associates vary mostly by area- some places you have a higher caliber of either at any given time. A lot of the time, I think you'll find lazy and ungrateful people in both ends of things (especially associates) but every once in a while you find that diamond in the rough. That one person that is truly thankful you went above and beyond for them. Upper management can be hard and unrelatable/unrealistic. They love what busy work- anything they can do to nit pick you. Be that % on adherence, messaging adoption rate, or promoting of flu or COVID vaccines. Don't let them fool you- they might say that they are doing this for the sake of the patients, but to be honestly WE are the only ones that truly care about the patients. Upper management only sees a big, hefty bonus and dollar signs- they could care less if these people take their medicine or die. Keep in mind that the pay is great. Schedules are flexible for the most part. It's a thankless job. But somebody's got to do it.",4,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Marianna, FL",8/25/21,2021,8,25

Stressful / rude management ,Some of the shift managers were nice but most were rude. It was stressful because they were always telling you to do more and more even when you are clearly working and getting your area done or as close to it as you can.  Favoritism runs big time in this company. ,2,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Fenton, MI",8/25/21,2021,8,25

very fun and chill,"Working as a csm is stressful at walmart if you dont have a good manger who knows how to schedule for the front end and if they dont give you enough cashiers to work with... The customers always upset with you even when its out of your control and poor management is the real reason behind the lack of customer service. They make it hard for you to do your job properly or provide good customer service. Mangement throw you out to the wolfs and you have to learn pretty much on your own, they never provide you with enough workers for you shift, and they dont pay you enough for the stressful work Load they place on you..but it can be a good starter job until you get something better",3,Former Employee,Self Checkout Host/Cashier ,"Katy, TX",8/25/21,2021,8,25
Decent job for teens or older people,"I worked on the stock team. Stocking either produce, meat or bakery. The job is very simple to pick up. Although it does take some time to memorize where everything is. Very rarely do you lift anything more than 20lbsPay isn't fantastic, although its decent if you're a teen just getting into the work force.

Wishy washy environment ,"As far as work load goes plenty to go around, due to  there lack of organization and constantly trying to fix something that isn't broken, and by trying to fix or change a procedure all it creates is more issues. Associates are cool but 95% are fake and wishy washy and only seem nice when they need something. Pay was good, culture very misleading. ",2,Former Employee,Loader ,"Brooksville, FL",8/25/21,2021,8,25
Has its days,"Was stressful but also fun, well at least coworkers were. Never a dual moment. Transfered stores to different states and was happy I was able to do that and still have a job.

",5,Former Employee,"Sales Associate, Department Manager, Support Manager ",Multiple locations,8/25/21,2021,8,25
Has gone downhill ,"Started off okay, management wasn't great by any means, but you could get the job done and go home. Halfway through 2020 they decided to change the entire structure, including management and job responsibilities. Many respectable managers who had been with the company for quite some time were suddenly demoted to regular associate, and they ended promoting mostly younger people who were, to put it swiftly, not cut out for a management position. A lot of them were not willing to put in the work, instead relying entirely on their associates, and just very obvious in that they felt they were better than everyone else. Front end is definitely the worst: they went from having maybe six or seven managers (usually two or three on a shift at a time), to 3 front end managers. They were all scheduled to work different times so that their shifts would not intersect as much as possible. Most of the time I would see them basically rely on the former CSMs to do their job for them because the job couldn't get done without the help. Upper management is even worse: a large majority of them do absolutely nothing besides tell other people what needs done, and then take out their frustrations on associates when someone above them holds them accountable for not everything getting done. Thing is, nothing can get done. They've cut down on associates, whilst giving every position even more job responsibilities, and on top of that, they don't even let associates get what they need to get done. A lot of the time, they will pull an associate from one struggling department to another, and expect both departments - more...",1,Former Employee,Entertainment TA ,"Elyria, OH",8/25/21,2021,8,25

Working hard and making minimum money,Walmart has taught me that the less people there the more your work and hard they make you work. They do have hour lunchs and breaks. But the work is just too much for one person to handle.,3,Current Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Indiana, PA",8/25/21,2021,8,25

"Pretty decent place to work, but it just wasn't my type of job to work.","I had some days I could tolerate and some I couldn't, but overall, I did not enjoy the job I did.

Needs more janitors,"management expected the entire store and all bathrooms to be kept clean, despite only having two janitors for days.

The Management and Associates are terrible to work with.,Talk about a workplace nightmare. I am currently a customer host and I can not recall a single time I was ever trained to check tickets. The management is never around to help regulate break times or answer questions that you have. The only time they ever pop up is when you are the only person at the door when there is supposed to be two people and they ignore it but will hunt you down to tell you that you are doing something minor wrong. They always under schedule and never call anyone else in if there are call offs so you will always be stuck by yourself dealing with nasty customers who spit in your face for asking them to show you their ticket and honestly I hate my job. Not to mention the fact that I’m unable to apply for any other position until I’ve been here for six months. I was late one time and the management decided to talk about it like it was the worst possible thing I could ever do but the same person calls off for an entire week and they don’t here a word about it. It’s a terrible place to work if you don’t like poor management and no teamwork.,1,Current Employee,Customer Host ,"West Monroe, LA",8/25/21,2021,8,25
No support for employees,"There was many times I was left by myself to run the deli cause of a call off; and management would not off any help at all. I was fired cause of an argument,but the other person I was arguing with did not even get in trouble. Walmart is a very disrespectful place to work at. There are no lead people that can pitch in if help is needed.",1,Former Employee,Production Associate II ,"Decatur, IL",8/25/21,2021,8,25

A good place to get your feet wet,"It was okay. The ""Walmart culture"" is definitely a very real thing. Lots of grumpy customers, huge orders, people upset over expired coupons, and some less than cooperative managers. My non-meal breaks were 15 minutes long and it took a solid 5-10 minutes just to get to the break room (they wouldn't let me have my break at the front end). I know there are some people who had a better experience than I did, and it's a shame because I could see a lot of potential in that job. ",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Oneida, NY",8/25/21,2021,8,25
Good position horrible managers,"My position as a digital shopper was actually really easy and fun itself but my management team and team leads were horrible, they harassed employees constantly. Atleast 30/40 people quit within the 6 months I’ve been here due to unfair work treatments. Getting days off or vacation days was an issue for me every single time even though I worked 40+ hours a week they will still not approve you or even medical leave you will have issues with. The company needs to re-evaluate their management staff seriously. I came to personnel, HR, and management with issues several times and I would receive no help at all but then they will turn around and expect you to stay late or come in on off days.

It's ok,"I do online grocery at a neighborhood Walmart and it's ok it's most definitely not for everyone its hot right now really fast pace and super stressful we either have not enough people or too many people called out it's the easiest job in the world and if you don't mind being hot when you go outside to take out orders its for you or if you don't mind walking around the store to get items it might be a good fit however you gotta learn fast and must be able to get stuff done independently because you might be left alone taking out orders for periods of time the pay is okay to we should definitely be paid more because more often than not we have a lot of down time and they want our department to help stock, cashier, price changes, and what not you basically have to do your job and you're expected to help every other department in the store",3,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Montgomery, AL",8/25/21,2021,8,25

Nightshift stocker ,The pay was okay but it can be tough especially when they tell you have an hour to finish a whole pallet regardless if the boxes are big or small and sometimes they will send you to different departments back and forth and expect you to finish them by the end of the day. Sometimes i had to stay overtime if I did not finished my deparment. Also I did not felt appreciated when I was there I was in so much stress that I had to quit for my health. One thing is what i hated the most if by any reason and god forbid that you have to attend a funeral and if you need more time to grief and if you do not have enough PTO time or PTTO there is a chance that they might fire you but if you get accpeted to LOA they may not pay you.

Extremely productive not very understanding ,My time at Walmart was spent covering others shifts just to please managers who don’t appreciate the employees.

You are simply a worker drone.,"You’ll never have enough people to get the job done 100%. Walmart’s business plan is to squeeze as much work as possible out of a small group of people until they are burned out and quit. Managers are like drill sergeants. You will be screamed at to work faster constantly and your hardest efforts will never be good enough. If you have to work here just show up, do your job and leave. Don’t do more than you’re asked because I promise you it will not be rewarded. You are simply a cog in the machine. ",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Conyers, GA",8/24/21,2021,8,24

A mediocre job,If your time is important outside of work  not too bad of a place to work. The company never forces hourly associates to work overtime. Benefits are average. 401k matches up to 6% of pay. The biggest negative is the constant changes the company makes and the low moral of associates working in the stores. Of course if you don't like working weekends don't bother. PTO time is good once one has been there long enough say five years.,3,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,Indiana,8/24/21,2021,8,24

What a nightmare ,"Worst company to work for. Was told during my 6 years there I could move up and do a different job. What a lie. They never let me, and when I asked what I could do to get another position at the store I was told change your availability. So I filed out multiple forms and they were always denied. One time I had 11 days off with no pay, was told never to show up or call for more house. I then asked if I could use some of my vacation  and was almost denied that (that was after 11 days off with no pay.) They then tell me ""well you should have told us, we would have given you time to work."" They told me that multiple times, and when I ask for time I was denied. It's a company that panhandles to customers but never their employees.",1,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Mesa, AZ",8/24/21,2021,8,24
Literally  the most soul sucking workplace there is. At Walmart  you are not a person to the company or management.  ,"Working  at Walmart  is very confusing...you will be miserable but hard to justify why. The managers are Almost always horrible and treat employees like tools rather than people.  The company itself has gone increasingly to automation and that affects how they treat the workers. On the other side of things....its extremely flexible and fair with missing work, the wages have skyrocketed,  and it's nearly impossible  to lose your job.

"As a Pharmacy Manager,","It's all about your direct supervisors, the market health and wellness directors. Some can be really tough on you, and some can be very supportive. I think overall, Walmart is less harsh than other retail pharmacies but as of late 2021, metrics are being pushed harder like flu shot goals, text messaging enrollment, adherence % and other items. Some of these are hard to influence and impact your bonus and other facets. ",4,Current Employee,Pharmacy Manager ,South Carolina,8/24/21,2021,8,24

Company has gone down hill.,"Over the past few years and especially over the past year the company has gone down hill. Fast. Walmart no longer values employees above all.

The negativity stands out more then the positivity.,"Some of the questions on your survey, I don't know anything about. But I will tell you what I've seen so far. In most situations, there is no such thing as team work here. It's like each shift is against each other. And some of the people who are in management either don't know their positions well or choose to put it on another team member. In management, a lot of people don't check whether or not if the job is completed correctly. It's like they want the position of management but some of them don't want the responsibilities that comes with it!!! They don't teach new employees how to do their jobs so that they can be productive and from what I see on a daily basis,  if I could, I would rather work for another company!!! But since Walmart is paying more, I'm here. Peace",4,Former Employee,Stocker ,I will not tell you!!!,8/22/21,2021,8,22

"An ""Okay"" Place to Work","Great for those looking to make a paycheck, go home and routinely repeat. However, if you are looking for something more involved such as a fun and engaging work-culture, management that is appreciative, cares about you and your growth/improvement—this is not the place to be. For a company that makes billions in revenue each year, next to none of that is spent on improving employee happiness. Maybe if they worked on that, turnover rate wouldn't be so high and the company would have a better reputation.I worked at Walmart for over a year in the cosmetics department and the managers barely knew who I was. We had to largely supervise ourselves in our section because front-end leads would never come by to check on us. Overall, if you have high patience, are self-sufficient and are tolerant of rude customers and unhelpful management....you'll survive.

Don’t care about their employees. Not worth the higher than average pay,"I worked in the Online Grocery Pickup department. Management is terrible, has no control over the employees in their department. Half the employees do whatever they want and hardly work, while the few who work hard are constantly pushed to cover for the slackers. If you’re lucky, you’ll be like the ones who never have to go outside in their entire careers. If you’re not, you’ll be like me, and have to work outside every single shift. You have to work in all weather no matter how dangerous. 100 degrees and deadly sun, bellow freezing temperatures and inches of solid ice in the parking lot, hurricane rain that soaks the groceries and ruins equipment, everything. Management doesn’t care if you get hurt. The management only cares about wait times, even though we’re constantly understaffed and overworked. They started raising the number of orders taken in a day, and promised to hire more employees, but never did. They gave us a raise, but if you’re not full time, you’ll sometimes have two weeks with no shifts. Poor management, awful customers. The job itself is ridiculously easy, but the awful management makes it as difficult as possible. ",1,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Johnson City, TN",8/22/21,2021,8,22

"Great Benefits, Hit or Miss Management ","The good of being a Team Lead at Walmart strongly depends on the area you're over. Being over Apparel is awful though don't do it. But it's also hard to be a Team Lead when you don't have a team to lead. This is largely due to being severely understaffed, and at my store that was because the way management speaks to you and associates is terrible. The store I work at has this recurring issue of no structure and unrealistic expectations that are followed by degrading and stress. It's just not a great environment to work in under the team lead structure. On the plus side you get free college and it pays pretty well. But to me, not worth the hassle and stress.

Hit or Miss,"While attending college I have been in-and-out of Wal-Mart since 2013 and have worked in four different positions in three different stores. So here is the truth:Honestly if you are NOT going to show up don't even bother applying to work at Wal-Mart. Locality determins the quality of the work enviroment i.e. managers, coworkers etc. I can honestly say that in the three stores that I have worked at, there are better stores out there in the U.S. So yes transfers are possible, but costly in time and patience.Yes it's possible to move up at Wal-Mart. I went from customer host (greeter) to Department Manager (aka Team Lead) in a matter of months for simply greeting the store manager every morning with a smile. He was very nice man.But after experiencing a sample of the corporate climate, I would not recommend moving up any higher. The demands of corporate and reality do not often mix well and the pressure between the two is enough to strain even the most commited individual. But once you get an overview of the land, then you understand why the pressure is so extreme. As a result of this ""extreme pressure"" I stepped down as a DM and became a Personal Shopper for Online Grocery Pick-Up (OGP). Which truly is the best department to be in, with regards to pay and work quality. OGP you have two simple tasks: Picking up the items or Dispensing it to the customer's vehicle. So if you are serious about showing up to work then apply at Wal-Mart.com/Careers.  ",4,Former Employee,Customer Host ,"Charlottesville, VA",8/22/21,2021,8,22
"Very poor management, short staffed ","It would be a great job, as I like fast paced and keeping always busy, but lack of staff make it impossible to keep up with the demands of my department.

I skip my breaks and take the minimum lunch you're allowed and work my butt of and I still can't get it all finished because I'm either by myself or one other person in my department.

Some manager fail to follow through with what they say they will do consistently, others are great. Pay is improving, however not for all areas of the store. Benefits are decent, for now.

Being nice to customers and making conversation is what sets certain cashiers apart. Management was okay, didn’t see them often unless there was a problem. Hardest part of the job was long lines being a seasonal worker and working Black Friday and throughout the Christmas season. After holidays hours are cut back. When there’s an occasional error due to system or pricing, waiting on a supervisor to come help can sometimes upset the customers.

Only work here if you absolutely have to.,"There are very few good things I can say about working at Wal-Mart.  The best part of my job was my co-workers.  We were there to help each other get through the day.  We all knew how bad the job was and were all really supportive of each other.  And I will say that there were a FEW customers who were nice and who were what you would call regulars who liked me to wait on them.  The job itself was very, very hard on the body.  I left every day with my feet just screaming at me.  Customers at this store were demanding and unappreciative.  So were the managers.  They did not appreciate you and loved to play the ""gotcha"" game. meaning they loved to catch you doing something wrong.  The only reason I took this job is because it was suggested to me that I get a job ""with benefits.""  Well, I never signed up for benefits because they don't really give you the time to do that.  You are either on the floor or on break.  And you cannot, per company policy, do administrative tasks such as sign up for medical benefits on break.  Speaking of medical, I had to get a DOCTOR'S NOTE to go to the bathroom.  Yes, folks.  I was going to the bathroom a lot because of a medical condition I have.  I was not able to go to the bathroom as many times as I needed to without a doctor's note.  So they work you so hard that they even track your bathroom breaks.

I am against forcing people to do things to there own body’s they are not comfortable with by threatening there livelihood.Don’t get me wrong I am not a Walmart hater or anything like that.

Job security to a certain extent. ,They never really want to fire you but mid level management takes the blame for upper management and usually takes steep pay cuts if the store as a whole can not meet standards.,1,Former Employee,Walmart supervisor ,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",8/21/21,2021,8,21
Good entry level positions ,"Not recommended for hard workers that want to be recognized. Be prepared to work hard unloading truck s pulling pallets, working the freezer and refrigeration dept, and wear comfortable shoes. ",2,Former Employee,STOCKER ,"San Antonio, TX",8/21/21,2021,8,21
Takes a certain kind of person,"Fast paced. If you're hired for one area, be prepared to be cross trained for 3 others. On the front end, we are perpetually understaffed and morale is abysmally low. Upper management tells you to do one thing, but then changes their mind to the exact opposite 30 seconds later. Most of them either micromanage you until you break down or just don't care at all. I've had to fight to get my corporate mandated breaks so often I've given up. Trying to get coverage for lunch is a war in itself. I used to love it here. Now I almost have a panic attack walking into the building. ",2,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Blair, NE",8/21/21,2021,8,21
"Over worked, inconsistent scheduling, rude management ",This is not easy work. You will be on your feet all day other than during breaks. Wear comfortable shoes. They offer different shifts but good luck actually working your set schedule. They often make overtime mandatory depending on demand (especially with COVID) and will give you short notice. They go back and forth about schedules and start times. Management is ok besides some bad apples. Temple is rude and accused me of leaving work early one day when she actually changed me from one area to another and didn’t transfer my badge over (I was new and didn’t know how to do this). It’s a fast pace work environment. I worked in the module picking orders. There are different departments you can be assigned to. I would not work here again. Great way to make good money fast but not realistic long term job for me. ,2,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Atlanta, GA",8/21/21,2021,8,21
The customers because they mean everything to me I love customer service,Management is in good. But customer service is great. If everybody put as much time as I did in the caring about the customer and the well-being of the associates then I think the store would be a better place.

Dont expect a life if you want hours,"If you are not available 24/7 they will cut your hours to under 20. They will expect you to do jobs you don't have training for, any way to do or even telling you you were expected to do a managers job, then deny you a raise because you didn't do the job. Very clique. There's always a couple queen bees and if they don't like you, you will never advance. You will be written up for anything so their friends can advance.

will work you to death,"They don't care about you at all, unless you're their favorite. They have 4 point system for calling out, the points last 6 months, you get yelled for using your ppto. They'll cross train you in different places but will never give you a raise. I worked in an area making 11 an hour, I was crossed trained for unloading the trucks, online grocery pickup, cashier, jewelry, and electronics they don't ask you if you could help out in the areas you're crossed trained in, they make you. I wouldn't waste my time here, you have no time to yourself, management constantly criticizes you, and they never give you positive feedback. You'll notice the same people call out yet receive zero points, but if you reach 5 points and you're on their favorite list they fire you.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Hurricane, UT",8/20/21,2021,8,20

Nothing ,"Decent for a first job. However, if you work as a cashier, you get the minimum wage of $14 in California.

Walmart used to be great but the changes are going down hill. ,"After being at Walmart for 11+ years I can say it used to be a great company. There is always something you can do to be busy and feel accomplished at the end of the day. The benefits for full timers is good, the pto ratio is amazing the longer you stay. The yearly pay increases ($.20 -$.50) that we used to have was more than enough incentive to stay with the company but that’s something the company has moved away from. Walmart is NOT for the faint of heart, it is hard work that is certainly not appreciated by the customers and management is not always good about saying something, but that’s a person by person issue and not company. Now the changes from the company over the past five years is just digging it own grave. Market management and CEOS are cutting away their own support tree. They’ve thinned out management and leader positions (some have been good decisions and some have not) but as the pay increases have stopped so too has new fresh recruits wanting to work at Walmart so slowly more and more tasks are pressed down onto everyone in the store level. There is not enough support nor overall management that they can actually meet company expectations nor hold anyone accountable. There is no follow up and follow through anymore because the company has slowly neutered their management. It is not the company it used to be and it won’t get better for a while to come….",3,Current Employee,OGP/ODP Online Pickup Associate ,"Sioux Falls, SD",8/20/21,2021,8,20

It's the company's fault,"The coworkers were very friendly. Cashiering was great as it is busy to make the shift go fast. However Walmart is more worried about self check out then having actual lanes open and the customers don't like that. (Most of the workers don't either) you get an hour lunch which is great. The pay is not enough to deal with angry customers yelling at you about no lanes being open. I'm not sure If it was just short staffed, but I'm pretty sure it's just walmart.

Mostly-relaxed workplace with only a few cons,"I have enjoyed working for Walmart for the most part. The one thing I dislike most about the job was the limited availability of positions during the hiring process and then I feel stuck in my current position with no way to move to a preferred position. They do offer financial assistance for classes at an online university to permanent employees that are eligible. I feel that's truly the only way to get ahead in the workplace by putting in the effort to attend one of the many courses that they offer—at least for me anyways. I do enjoy working with my co-workers as they are uplifting everyday and I feel comfortable coming to work and while I'm at work every day. As per my personal experience, it's a relaxed place to work for most but you won't be earning all that much unless in a well-payed position, which can be very difficult to even reach. It's definitely a better job than working in the fast food industry and the pay is better too.

They raised our wage to 16 an hour, but they cut hours down, leaving us closers (6-7 people tops in those closing shifts) with horrible pay that is not enough to live on. As well as that, we do not receive bonuses now in result of this raise. Some of the other employees are fine, but most don’t care about their job, put the work on others, and use derogatory language.

I got pretty good at the job pretty fast, but with that came work overload. they would overwork me to compensate for not enough workers/workers that didn’t meet their daily quota. I was exhausted physically and mentally every day. Also none of the workers are welcoming at all. Everyone is just there to get their $ and leave. So if negative work environments would negatively affect you, I would not recommend this job. I would recommend this job if you want to make decent money, but are willing to do hard work and move at a fast pace for 8 hrs, and don’t mind overtime.

Low pay,I like working at Walmart but they pay is pretty darn low even compared to most retail places and no matter how hard you work you’ll be expected to work harder,2,Former Employee,Stocker ,Wisconsin,8/19/21,2021,8,19

They don’t care about their employees,"Employees are given expectations that far exceed ability, time allowed, and workforce. Management is negligent and is always too busy to help when needed. Corporate allows stores to take on more online orders than they can handle given the workforce, which in turn negatively affects every other department in the store.

This job is definitely a good one," I thoroughly enjoy working here! I love my hours and schedule, I love my pay rate, my coworkers are awesome and my managers are the coolest people in the world, they are laid back but funny, understanding, personable and treat you like a friend or equal! You get Discounts AND you get to see what is back in stock bc you stocked it. ",5,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Spanaway, WA",8/19/21,2021,8,19
Walmart is actually pretty average,"To summarize it Walmart is an okay company to work for, but certainly not the best. A lot will depend on how the management handles the day-to-day. My Walmart has a very good team.Benefits are average at best for someone with children. However, for young people, Walmart provides a very cheap, almost free college tuition for selected courses. I think this is probably the best benefit that they offer.Walmarts healthcare is not great, vision is decent though.Also, only part-timers at this point have access to flexible schedules.",3,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Rochester, NH",8/19/21,2021,8,19
Walbrook #2065,"This Walmart #2065 has a high turn over rate and I’m starting to see why people have been putting in two week notices and just not showing back up to work.It also doesn’t matter what you apply for, they put you where they want you, and they will talk down to you if you ask to move to different departments etc.Granted there are a handful of good team leads that genuinely care about their people but they can only do so much because at the end of the day upper management and personall don’t care about their employees. Ohhhh and they keep the air turned up high so it’s extremely hot in the store. For the pay, it isn’t worth it the stress. Look elsewhere.",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Knoxville, TN",8/19/21,2021,8,19
Unprofessional atmosphere with tyrants in management. ,"Walmart is the Worst company I've ever worked for in my 40 years of work experience, they treat employees with no respect,  constant shouting and narcissistic behavior seems to be the norm.",1,Former Employee,Temp Associate ,Ocoee Super Walmart ,8/19/21,2021,8,19

Coworkers make the job fun. ,"Like most jobs, Walmart and its management has favorites. Although you are part-time, sometimes you make 40 hrs, but no full-time benefits.

Fast paced work environment,"I loved working here. It was fast paced, & they gave me more hours than I expected. Employees were nice, & management was helpful & friendly. My only complaint is the work/home balance. It was so hectic. My schedules were all over the place. They were always short staffed, so always needed the extra help which was great when it comes to money, but stressful for family time. ",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Atwater, CA",8/19/21,2021,8,19

Could work 8 hours one day and work 13 the next. ,4,Former Employee,Unloader ,Mississippi,8/19/21,2021,8,19
Terrible,Walmart doesnt care about its employees at all. I was treated terribly constantly. Only good thing out of being an associate is the pay. $11 an hour was great besides the fact they gave you so much to do constantly and gave you time limits. Coworkers and team leads put all the hard work and blame on newer associates. Most stressful time of my life. They also suck at training you and expect you to just know what to do. ,1,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Pasadena, TX",8/19/21,2021,8,19
It’s just ok,I honestly learned how to do this job through reddit. I mean they give you around two days of supervised training then you’re on your own. The hour lunches were nice. There was no ac in the store only in the break room. I would ask for things such as change if i ran out in the register and depended on whoever is in management you won’t get it. Taught me a lot about working under pressure and patience. ,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Macon, GA",8/19/21,2021,8,19
They give you time off from calling out without being penalized.,"The company requests excessive amounts of work from one individual for very little pay. Unless you have tough skin, I strongly would not recommend a job with them that requires being around customers constantly; being you will frequently come across rude customers. Majority of their stores are consistently and underwhelming understaffed and there are a lot of services that require employees to be attentive. The management at most stores typically are lazy, and can be difficult and frustrating to work with; but get paid pretty well while the “subordinates” do all the hard work for minuscule pay. I wouldn’t recommend working for Walmart long term unless you need to get your foot in the door for other jobs.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Kansas City, MO",8/18/21,2021,8,18
It’s okay,"The best thing about the job is the vacation and pay. But the hours are stressful, especially if you have a family and not enough help which we currently don’t have. I may get to see my daughter 2-3 hours each day before she goes to bed. And I put her to bed late just for that reason. Usually between 9:30-10:30. I work 10 hour days IF I leave on time.

No Work/Life Balance,"This may be a great place for someone single, no kids, or don't mind spending most of their time at work vs. home and family. It IS a nice place to work....very easy. You just have to get in a zone to tolerate the excessive changes that might occur. At times there is a lack of communication. MY biggest issue is the 10 and 12 hour shifts. 3-4 days off seems great, but would be greater if the hours could be 8. There is no option for full or part time.....only full time. HR makes it difficult for associates to handle business through the week. Really no way to avoid points because most businesses open at 8am and close at 5pm, but you're at work...so you're screwed regardless what you need to do......missing a day, coming late, or leaving early. You're doomed to lose your job.",3,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Union City, GA",8/18/21,2021,8,18

Not terrible for the starting wage,"Only worked here for six months. The job was pretty fair and doable for most of that time, but eventually we got new management.

Under-appreciated work and poor management ,The work is easy and can be done without having to really think at all. Pay is not that great.

"Hard work, no pay",Team lead=higher ranking cashier. I had an amazing coach but grossly understaffed and all are underpaid. Constant circus with never enough cashiers or cart pushers. For a company that made a killing during the pandemic they have some of the lowest wages. Cashier start at $11 and rarely get significant raises where is Aldi starts their cashiers at $14 an hour. As a result team leads often end up cashiering and rounding up carts and cleaning in addition to doing their supervisory jobs,3,Former Employee,Team Leader ,Southwest Florida,8/18/21,2021,8,18

I was denied my breaks after working a long shift. I had to use the bathroom and was told by my manager that I should have used it before working my shift.

We are severely understaffed, meaning we constantly miss breaks/have late lunches/have to do extra work. People are quitting in waves for better paying jobs, and management seems unwilling to offer better incentives to bring in new workers. There is usually little or no communication between managers and regular associates, with us non-management being consistently left in the dark and forced to suffer the consequences of not knowing what is going on.

Nothing  ever gets done after a report is filed, your coworker can literally tell you that they hope you die and once you report it, nothing gets done.

"Used to be great, giant shift in past year","I bleed Walmart blue.  Used to be a great place to work, family atmosphere, we felt like we had a purpose and we would come together to achieve our goals.  It used to be about 3 core beliefs.  Since new CEO and COO were installed, company has drastically cut back salaried managers and hourly supervisors.  Has made it nearly impossible to deliver what is being asked, during a pandemic,  with zero regard for our physical/mental/emotional well-being.  Used to have solid work-life balance, now your job is threatened constantly.  Market level leadership all have own agenda, too much politics.  Constant fire drill executive visits.  Used to be able to just take care of associates and customers; now everyone just trying to 'not get fired'.  Really disappointed with direction of company.

The task of repairing most things is contracted out. We were part of the Customer Service Dept. They are very busy. We get neglected, except when something needs cleaning. We did not have a supervisor that had any cleaning experience. Our work was not inspected very much. You receive your in services and training on computers that Walmart has set up in the building.  You need daily check the computers to receive your inservices and training. I didn’t and it was a problem. There is no advancement in this field, but you can transfer to other departments where the sky is the limit!  I loved my co-workers!  Great people.

The Good and Bad,"I'll start with the good. When FT you can request what shift you'd like to work and have the same days off. A couple coworkers and managers are nice. You can take breaks when you want to (if not dispensing) and you won't usually be yelled at if you are unable to take your hour lunch on time.Sadly the bad outweighs the good, but this is a Walmart after all. Most coworkers have cliques and seem cold. Some are straight up rude. There are a LOT of lazy coworkers who will do absolutely nothing, like sit down and play on their phone or talk to their friend on their phone with earbuds, even if we are slammed with 10 cars in the parking lot. The managers don't care and are even 'friends' with them.A few managers are micromanagers (one is extreme) and will scold you for things you have not done, but will not scold people who have been there longer for doing the same things. You will also be bossed around by coworkers who think they are managers for some reason, but there are only like two of those.Good luck getting even one Sunday/Saturday off. HR is NEVER in the office and the coach is always impossible to find/busy, so if you need help with anything it's like a game of finding Waldo. HR is not very nice and can seem condescending, as a cherry on top.The stocking team seem to purposefully block aisles with huge pallets, making it difficult to get around them and get what you need while you're on a time limit. This happens even when customers are in the store. Things on the shelves are commonly not in the right place due to the stockers being lazy or we will be completely out - more...",3,Former Employee,Order Picker ,"Shelbyville, TN",8/17/21,2021,8,17

Optician,"I love my job working as an optician, but the job does have its stressful moments. We have the trickle-down system of the higher-ups holding up high expectations and making changes that don't always benefit the staff and the patients we take care of. Communication seems to lack between management, which affects others in the store. I will say during the height of the pandemic, they utilized us in other parts of the store so we didn't lose our jobs.

Not to mention you’ll feel like a number more than like a person. There’s this constant feeling that you are replaceable and there’s always a lot of turnover which just feeds into that. Management either cares too much about rules or too much about their own job to really go out of their way to help you. Oh and make sure you keep track of how many days you’ve had to miss because no one warns you when you’ve missed too many.

Management has high expectations for those who show they are hard workers, but will be quick to reprimand if those expectations aren't met.The attendance policy has a balance between helpful and ridiculous, it depends on how you use it. You get fired after 4.5 points, but they will secretly take off points for people they don't want to lose. You get PTO and PPTO if you are full time and have passed the probationary period. PTO can be for scheduled days off or to get paid if you have to call in but it will NOT remove the point for calling in. PPTO can be used to go home early, come in late, or take off a point if it is put in within a week of the occurence date.

Alright if you need money,You don’t really get weekends off even when you request them sometimes. You will spend most of your days working a non set schedule. Hours vary depending on the position you’re in. The management is alright depending on the people there that day. It’s not always calm it’s usually hectic because everyone goes to Walmart. You get a 10% discount card 3 months after working for them. All cashiers still get paid the same while everyone else gets paid 15 or more. Cashiers only get paid 11 and didn’t receive the raise they were told they were going to get. We only got 22¢ raise. It’s an alright job for the summer or for a student. Stock and other positions is where you'll earn $15. In store shoppers get $12. Overall if you are late or need a day off you can put in pto if you have it. If not then you probably won’t be able to take a day off. Unless you call off and choose to take the points. You only get 5 or 6 before you’re terminated. You cant accept tips or you get in trouble possibly lose your job.,3,Current Employee,Host ,"Houston, TX",8/15/21,2021,8,15

Productive and Fun place but management could use some work,"Some of the managers are top notch people and talk to you and listen to what you have to say and they help you with whatever you need. But there are some who don’t know what they are doing. And therefore just making everyone frustrated since they tell us what to do, seeming unsure about the answer. Just need more listening and learning how to communicate like most great managers that work there, so we can all be on the same page and energy. Otherwise there’s some great people there, others just trying to get the work done, and we help each other out.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"La Quinta, CA",8/15/21,2021,8,15
Everyone is overworked with unrealistic expectations.,One's job is threaten on a regular basis.  Managers are overworked and fearful of repercussions from upper management. Only the pharmacists feel secure in their positions. Most of the folks who have been there two years or more have a great work ethic. I witness some of the hardest working people on the planet leave because of burnout. Virtually everyone on the store level is on edge constantly. My immediate manager is toxic because she has unrealistic expectations forced upon her which spiral down. It has affected the moral of our whole team.,3,Current Employee,Associate ,"McDonough, GA",8/15/21,2021,8,15
fast paced environment with always something to do,My day usually starts out by grabbing a scanner and a shopping cart & we then go “pick” (shop for customers). We are timed when we go pick groceries & have a timeline while doing so. For the most part all of my team leads & managers are pretty cordial & easy to talk too.

Management doesn't care about the customers let alone employees,"They no longer care about the customers safety. They no longer care about the customers convenience. Their goal is to make the store as hard to find things in as possible so the customer has to wander around aimlessly in an attempt to make them buy more things. Only, they also grown on employees taking time to try to help a customer locate what they want. If they are this bad for the people whose purchases keep the place in business you can guess how they treat the leeches looking for a pay check.

Decent workplace,A typical work day was alright depending on the day. As for what I learned was nothing really. Our management was terrible after our stores management change with one amazing manager. The work culture wasn’t terrible but it wasn’t great either.

What you put in is what you get ,"You're fairly compensated for the job you perform. Being a Team Lead can be difficult if you have thin skin since most customers have no respect for the employees. For some reason, they don't believe that the world has a staffing shortage and wants us to go through mitosis in order to open up more registers. Once we move from the 90's era of ""The customer is always right"", we'd probably get more respect from the shoppers. The co-workers are fantastic and the Coaches try their best to shield junior management and associates from whatever storm is brewing within the upper echelon of the store.

"If you do your job, you have to do everyone else's job aswell","The only good thing is that as long as you show up to work you will get paid. Half of the employees don't do their job and no one says a word to them about it. Management just goes ""well, I guess I just wont expect as much from them."" If you're a good worker though, you are expected to get your freight ran as quickly as you can so that you can go and do everyone else's job for them while they play on their phone, gossip, and walk around like they forgot they're at work. If you do your job they will let you know when you're not doing good enough if you're having an off day.  The more work you do, the more they expect you to do. Each week there is a new extra task that they want you to complete on top of your normal job even when it's clear that their previous goals aren't being met. If you go to management about the unfair balance of work, they just say they're looking to make a change then they do nothing and say nothing to anyone. Even when they do write people up, the employees do even less in spite because they know for a fact that they wont fire them or even cut their hours. Upper management expects ridiculously unrealistic goals for certain shifts while other shifts just come in and walk around like they're just being paid to show up. Also, nothing is ever completely done by the end of your shift. So they want you to stay over and help do extra tasks even if you have other responsibilities outside of work. If you don't stay they try to make you feel guilty about it. The next day they will be sure to let you know how long they ""had"" to stay over their normal shift even though - more...",1,Current Employee,Stocking ,"Greenfield, IN",8/15/21,2021,8,15
Great First Job and That's It,"As a sales associate it's a pretty easy job unless management finds you to be a hard worker then they will leach the life out of you. From jus tidying up, helping customers and putting up returns you end up starting to do your managers job and more if they can. You MIGHT get a 10 cent raise every year but that's a big maybe because if you have too many points at the time they're doing evaluations you wont get it. Management is terrible. You can barely call them management because they do NOT know how to manage. HR can't even get schedules right. Coworkers can be chill though. Additionally the company/management doesn't take complaints about harassment seriously. They say they'll address it and then swipe it under the rug. I did enjoy the job for the first year as I was in high school and it honestly kept me busy and they would be REALLY flexible with my schedule. But as I was there longer and longer they kind of just started not caring and overworked me. Also a good thing to note is that they do not take doctors notes. TLDR: If you're a teen and want a job that pays pretty good and can give you some good stories. You'll wanna work here. If you're an adult looking for reliable benefits and growth opportunities? Run.

"Fast paced environment, but unhelpful coworkers/management","I worked at Walmart for a few months as a Online Grocery Assistant; and at the start it was wonderful. A week in, however, Walmart started to show its true colors. The work was very fast paced, which I liked, but when business REALLY started to pick up, as in people arriving to pick up their groceries, I would be left in the room alone to deal with multiple customers at a time, each with potentially humongous orders. This was happening in my first week as an employeee there, before I was fully trained. The Team Leads in my department did not seem to care about any of their employees at all, as half of the day, they would be missing, smoking cigarettes out in front of the building. Half of the employees that I worked with did not seem to care about their job either, especially one who would go missing for two hours at a time, SLEEPING in the break room.Also, the management did not seem to care about when you were available to work or not. You were either scheduled your full available hours, or given less than 20. No inbetween.

Great co-workers and cool culture but bad management,"Most of the time things are alright when you have the right people around you and running things.

You can be the hardest working person in there and it still can be your downfall when others don't pull their weight, leaving you to do everything with not the best pay.  Proper management at this store is pretty subpar when they lack communication skills not only with associates but with each other, solve their problems with short-term solutions, and don't lead by example with certain rules/policies.  While the good people in management often leave/move stores or are never around enough.  Otherwise, the culture ,while not as good as before, is decent along with the many benefits Walmart can offer and the customers aren't all bad to bring service to.  Its mainly clashing with management decisions and bad communication/speech skills.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Emporia, VA",8/13/21,2021,8,13

Management comes and goes as you stay with the company and I've had good managers and bad managers.

"Pretty Good Pay, Decent Management, Decent Job Experience. ","The pay is good. If you can put up with the constantly rising expectations, you can make a fair bit of money especially during peak demand or if you come in a lot for overtime. During the holidays it is not unusual to have to work 6 days a week, and the time and half adds up quickly.  In terms of job performance, the rate my department shot for when I first started nearly a year ago was 200 units per hour with a cutoff usually between 160 and 180. Now the ideal is 260 with a cutoff of 228. The same thing has been going in for every department as far as I know. There’s a lot of variance among the managers and leads in terms of how good they are at their job and how much they are willing to work. Some are really good, others just spend the day jerking off. Sometimes their poor management leads to poor performance by the associates. While this can be frustrating, they are generally good at taking responsibility for these incidents. Overall if you come in and work hard you’ll be fine 90% of the time. ",4,Current Employee,Packer/Shipper ,"Pedricktown, NJ",8/13/21,2021,8,13

We are rewarded with snacks, pizza, free soda when we have a heavy workload and I have been personally thanked for doing a good job which is something I never heard at my last workplace-all I got was criticism at the last place.  There is one lead I dont care for, but there's always one in every workplace and my overall experience has been good.  I am full time and would like to switch down to 4 days a week, but I'm not sure that will happen-and I'm ok with that, I will do this long as I can.

Prepare for the worst. Hope for the best! ,"I worked here for about a year as a high performing freezer order filler. I made some really good friends while I worked here. Some to this day still. The workers here are very hardworking, and for the most part a joy to work with.Unfortunately.... In my year working there I went through more manager's than any other job. 9 different shift managers in that time period. I've been a manager before, and im not saying that I could have done way better. Although who Walmart hires as their managers, and the training they go through is absolutely ridiculous. I have never felt so unappreciated at any job compared to this level. I have experienced being berated by a head shift manager on a loud speaker with at least 60 coworkers around me. On multiple occasions. That may not sound like a big deal but when your co-workers treat you different. It does. I tried to report the incident to HR, and is there was no follow-up action.Prepare your self to hold in your bathroom most of the day. It's an inside joke between many people there. Not kidding.... You will be harassed by management. There's only a 15-minute break, and a 20-minute break. So you have to fidgure out what you need to get done in that time.I'd recommend working here if you need good money for a litte bit or for a long time. Just be prepared to go through the gauntlet. I wish things at Walmart were better, because i didnt want to find a better opportunity. It's a good place to start yourself in a warehouse, because they hire just about anybody.

Depends on your store honestly,"Walmart can be a great place to work but it literally ALL depends on who you have as your upper management and what type of Walmart you’re working at. Super Centers are easier when it comes to some of the stresses simply because there are so many employees. Neighborhood Markets can be great but they’re limited to staffing hour availability SUPER harshly so especially in certain departments there will be only a few employees at a time. It gets very stressful because there simply isn’t enough people to go around. Each store is told how many hours they have to schedule people so it gets difficult for HR because if they go over it’s a huge deal and a big no no. Neighborhood Markets are also filled with lots of drama because of the smaller amount of staff where as in a super center you will not even be able to learn everyone’s names because there’s simply too many employees. Walmart has also completely changed their management in Neighborhood markets. There are only 2-3 salaried members of management which is very stressful on the other managers who are hourly because no overtime is permitted to complete a lot of tasks so it makes the whole situation way more difficult. They discontinued quarterly bonuses and went to one bonus a year which isn’t even guaranteed to be as large as the amount of all 4 quarterlies. Benefits are TOP NOTCH and don’t cost very much at all to cover medical, dental, and vision. Walmart needs to definitely pay closer attention to the associate surveys. Corporate needs to do better on testing new ideas or policies in stores before launching it company wide. - more...",4,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"Wylie, TX",8/13/21,2021,8,13

good stability zero interaction,While it's next to impossible to get fired without obvious err on your part the job involves next to no dealing with coworkers and aside from coaching (writs ups) absolutely none of your coworkers will speak to you. Almost every single coworker won't know more about you than the name on your badge. Rising through the ranks is next to nonexistant. Every new manager is an outside hire and old managers just transfer out or retire. Worse the upper management does not hold meetings and any employee unfortunate enough to not hold an extremely niche job handled by a single manager will be buffeted about by their individual blind actions that create scenarios impossible to resolve. As a cashier I had seven managers and among them I gained enough attendance infractions to be fired without my knowledge as they shifted my schedule without my knowledge. Also while they do offer training and even paid training you cannot take it off the clock and if you are on the clock you must be scheduled for it or you will gain infractions for stealing time.

Bad company ,Treat employees terrible. Too many managers tell you what to do and conflicting with each other’s orders. Pay is low. Would not recommend a career here.

Revolving Door,"This place is a warm body mill. New batches of trainees are cooked up every week, and by the end of their 2 week training, half of them are already gone thanks to the brutal hours and productivity expectations. EVERY move you make is tracked to ensure enforcement of these quotas, meaning if you need to use the restroom, you generally have to wait until break or risk being written up. During my work week, my life becomes a blur of eat, sleep, work. By the time you factor in getting ready, driving to work, and doing the shift then driving back home, it's almost 15 hours (Weekend shift 5am - 530pm). Having 4 days off is nice though, but beware of mandatory overtime. Admittedly, when the end of the day comes, I do feel somewhat satisfied walking out the door, but in my opinion, it's not worth the stress and headaches, not to mention too the HR sometimes messes up payroll, many of us did not get a cent of our promised bonuses recently. If you're a tougher person than I and need decent pay with overtime if you choose, this is the place for you.

Major issues,"General treatment and behavior towards every employee, regardless of position, is toxic 98% of the time. There are exceptions, few and far between, who understand proper communication and basic management skills. Extremely toxic place to work. No clear direction. Everyone is stressed and often taking their own frustrations out on those under them. It’s just a chain of miss placed anger. They tout about their Academy training, but there is seemingly no follow up to uphold said trainings. Voiced concerns seem to be highly important on face value. No repercussions or any action seems to take place, but they will try to sooth your worries with affirmative language. In all seriousness, working for Walmart has taught me sometimes it’s best to shut down and grind out a paycheck. The pay and flexibility are the only reasons we stick around. Gotta do what you gotta do.",1,Current Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Fayetteville, AR",8/11/21,2021,8,11

"""Quantity over quality""","It seems as though management cares more about how much an employee gets done in a short amount of time rather than the quality of work done.

For example, i work overnights and as an overnight stocker i am mainly responsible for stocking the shelves/racks.

Will be appreciated if you do your job. ,I have worked for Walmart for over 10 years. I enjoy being able to accomplish my tasks that have been given to me and make my area look nice. I really enjoy the people I've worked with over the years and have never had a problem with that. Management care about you and will listen to your concerns if they know you are a hard worker. The downside is recently throughout the whole store there has been to much freight coming into the store so the employees are not able to clean up the backroom and make it look nice even if there are more employees. ,4,Current Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Latrobe, PA",8/10/21,2021,8,10

Bad,"""I was hired as a “new manager” during COVID and really wanted to love it because it was my dream job out of college. Unfortunately, I realized quickly how awful this company was. They put SO much pressure on new managers to the point where they are overworked and basically working 3 jobs at once. The hours are terrible, too. You come in thinking you might have a 50-60 hour work week once in a while but they actually put pressure on you every week (even when you’re brand new) to work those hours (6am-4pm) because a lot of the leadership are hourly employees who get paid overtime when working 50-60 hour work weeks anyway. On top of that, they make you feel completely unappreciated and there is barely any real recognition. Giving your employees and umbrella or something because they are “2 years safe” is not the same as individually recognizing an individual for work really hard on a project or working late into the night trying to start up! Also, they make new managers feel completely disposable because they were constantly hiring new engineers out of college knowing others will quit so they didn’t care about you until 3 years in when they realized you weren’t going to quit. It’s an awful mentality and constantly hearing from operators and others that “oh I’m sure you probably found another job already” or “are you sure you REALLY want to stay here” 100% drives people to feel underappreciated and ultimately want to quit. I think pretty much everyone hated their job there which made people say things that they would never say in a good environment. They boast about how “competitive” - more...",1,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Chicago, IL",8/10/21,2021,8,10

Get a Good Therapist ,"This company seemed to be on a good track to improve. But ever since they started Great Workplace, it has been a nightmare.

An excellent career choice. But be sure to keep moving within the company!,"My last position before leaving Walmart was Customer Service Manager (CSM) in the state of California. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond my control, I am no longer employed with Walmart. Before reaching the Checkout and Front End departments, I learned about and worked in Grocery, Seasonal, Photo Lab, Pickup, Sporting goods, and Electronics. To this day, no other company has taught me as much as Walmart. In my experience, keeping a positive attitude, working diligently, and being supervised by a manager who supports you and who cares about you will make all the difference. It is easy to fit in, no matter who you are. In my experience, you are guaranteed to meet tons of great customers and fellow associates alike. Amongst other things, Walmart offered competitive pay, great benefits for full-time associates, and stock options. And if our store performance met company goals, my store also offered store-wide bonuses for hourly and salaried associates. Plus, considering how many Walmart stores and distribution centers there are in the United States, it is easy to move almost anywhere in the country and keep your career going. In my honest opinion, working for Walmart offers fantastic job security in most sectors and in most states. Looking back, it's hard to think of myself wanting to start work anywhere else, my Walmart experience was definitely worth it.

"Overworked, unsuitable standards, high amounts of favoritism ","Management has tunnel vision, they have their favorites and that is who gets promoted. Unrealistic in their goals and expectations. You're expected to finish otherwise you're a hindering the team. You express your opinion, you're hindering the team, you have other obligations, you're a hindering the team. To Management, their company is the one and only and if you have something else going on you're hindering the team. Once you have hindered the team one to many times they will go out of their way to make you quit. For example: not scheduling staff on purpose to make goals harder to accomplish or leaving you on a heavy aisle alone with 3 or 4 pallets worth of work. Asking you to always cut hours because they don't want to pay for over time. Then asking you to finish the same work load with less hours puts even more stress on you.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"El Paso, TX",8/9/21,2021,8,9

Management,Walmart is a great job truly but your management is really the determining factor in how much you can/will enjoy the job. My experience with Walmart management has been nothing but sub/par. They play favorites and moving up is impossible and they will hold the “moving up” offer over your head to try and guilt trip you into doing everything they want you to do for the same pay rate as the weakest link in your associate chain. I have management responsibilities for regular associate pay and I am able to run 2 departments successfully by myself. ,3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service & Online Grocery Pick-up ,"Lexington, KY",8/9/21,2021,8,9

Great place to work during college! ,"I worked at Walmart while I was in college. The manager who was over the clothing department at that time was fresh out of college herself and was very understanding when I would ask off in order to study for finals, write a research paper, etc. Her ability to empathize and be flexible was greatly appreciate by me and by other college students in that department! A typical day for me included folding and sorting clothing, organizing merchandise, and assisting customers. I really enjoyed that type of work, to the point that coming to work was almost a stress reliever. I liked coming in from a long day of school and getting to take my mind off of the day's studies by organizing and setting things straight in the store. Of course, every job has some negative things about it. One thing that frustrated me about working at Walmart was that certain departments (grocery) had precedence over others. What that meant was that if the preferred department was short-handed that day, you would have to leave your department to go work in that one. It caused things to get very backed up in your own department, but upper-level management never seemed to care. This wasn't something I couldn't deal with, though - just an annoyance. Ultimately, I left Walmart in order to focus more intently on my senior year of college. I was honestly sad to go, as I had made several friends and had had a really great experience working there.

"Poor Management, No communication ","Managers don’t care about their employees. Anytime you would try to resolve issues you were having with work environment. You were punished instead of trying to resolve any of the issues. Certain co-workers were allowed to stand around, shop, walk the store, instead of being held accountable for their job, while the employees that actually showed up and done their jobs, were basically treated badly. Was hired on for part time, yet worked more than full timers. Ful-timers were told they couldn’t get their hours, hmm, so pretty much if u want full time put part time, and if u want part time put full time. To sum it up, whatever u want, they will give you the opposite,  never make the mistake again. ",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Alexandria, LA",8/9/21,2021,8,9

Good pay and hard work,"I'm in college and Walmart has the highest pay for a first job. I'm in loading so the work is physically tolling especially because of my build and flat feet. I'm learning quick after only a week being there. There's department numbers and locations that have to be known throughout the store and in the loading area. Unloading the truck is easily the worst part. Sometimes seems like we're one person short. Your stress/work level depends on what your pulling off the line and how much of its coming off the truck. Working around the pallets and carrying boxes is a great way to end up falling. But to succeed at the job you just need to be in decent physical shape, willing to learn, communicate, and work fast. Speed is key especially when there is a big load on the truck. 3200 item trucks(which are close the biggest we get) take around 4 hours for  6-8 people to do. My team has been really helpful at teaching me and assisting me, but my grace period is already over after a week so now I have to speed through everything which I'm not a fan of. I prefer doing things right over fast but honestly you'll end up getting nipped about something either way.",3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Eunice, LA",8/9/21,2021,8,9

It's not a job for wimps, but if you can make it through the probationary period then after that, it gets better. You get used to the warehouse atmosphere and learn to adapt.

Management does not care about the workers.,At the Walmart I work at I was subjected to lies and sweet nothings as I did my job. I was told that I would move up in a month. After the month passed nothing happened and then they continued to ignore me.

It's a typical retail job,The regular customers were better than the people I worked with. They were my favorite part of the job and the only thing I miss. I will say though they are always looking for managers so the ability to move up is constant. They are also always looking for employees so take from that what you will. They are also pretty flexible for hours and days available and you can pick up shifts as you need. ,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tampa, FL",8/8/21,2021,8,8

"Good people, okay job","I worked in a smaller store so the culture was a little closer and I saw people I knew in my community regularly. The people were the best thing about this job, but could arguably be the worst. Management was okay, the higher levels of management don't seem to care about about the low positions. Management was always hounding you about meticulous things. The work wasn't hard, it could be very stressful at times, but also very slow. The customers are the hardest part of the job. Because they do not see you as just an employee, you need to be a bit thick skinned. Also the discount was so little, not worth it to use it most of the time. Sometimes it wouldn't even take anything off.",4,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Arlington, WA",8/8/21,2021,8,8
"Not amazing, management dictates on how enjoyable your work life is.","Extremely easy job, however the management is consistently bad, and most of the time extremely lazy.

This is a good job for someone who needs a quick job. The best part, but also the worst are the people who work there.

Do Not Work Here!,"When I first started, it was fine. It started out as an easy job. But then after half a year, things went from great to horrible. And I mean a good solid 8 immediately down to 1 on a scale. We scanned bins and purged, but that we kept getting piles and piles and piles of freight, and a good majority wouldn't go out. So because the bins were always full, backstock was left on pallets. Everyday, we got in all the same stuff we had no room for. I can't tell you how many times I day in the past few months that I've broken down in the bathroom crying because I was so stressed. Worst part, the managers don't care. They won't do anything about it. I don't feel safe there and I suggest no one works there. ",1,Current Employee,Associate ,"Wisconsin Rapids, WI",8/7/21,2021,8,7
Management can be terrible at some locations ,"I worked at a Walmart for a year or so and I can say that management was terrible. They wouldn’t listen to the workers and continued to change up the ‘rules’ each time that a management change happened. We weren’t able to work freely and comfortable and was always getting written up over the smallest situations that weren’t that big of a deal or issue to people, The management held grudges against people with disabilities, pregnancies, or anyone suffering with mental issues, An HR even leaked personal information about a worker who went to him to seek help. Our front end coaches kept stepping down because of the stress that was out in them by our front end manager.

Schedules were all over the place with no chance of a work/life balance, and being scheduled outside of your availability- got a legit reason to only have certain work hours?

Busy and positive crew on nights,"  Sadly, I had to leave this full time maintenance position and have regretted it ever since. My tasks were clearly laid out for me every night and I was able to just go at it for the entire shift with little interruption/multitasking.    The manager and shift leads on nights are positive, easy to get along with and know how to train you to get the job done right the first time around.  Night maintenance team pays well and is a perfect example of a 'drama free' workplace.

It's only fine for 3 years,"So, I have been at this place for a decent amount of time (3+ years) to understand how this particular company works. It is the most unrewarding job to have. If you have no prospects and no real goals in what you want to do, this place is fine. After a while, you start questioning what it is that you're doing and if anything you do has a purpose or a point. This place is a revolving door of employees and the management just could not care less. It is disorganized and the people who we are expected to trust (HR and Management) just shows you why that is a bad idea. There is no such thing as flexibility at this job, they literally expect you to prioritize being a cashier over your real life. When you actually try to ask and do the process of changing your availability; HR will give you every excuse in the book as to why you can't even if that isn't your problem. Also, PTO and asking for days off is a nightmare; they act like the computer is the sole responsibility for approving things but when you ask for time off in ADVANCE they'll deny it and come up with every excuse and they'll try to make you feel bad about asking too. Moving up in the company is a joke; I've literally witnessed people who deserve the promotion get shot down for reasons like attendance but give it to those who are well over the limit of the point system. I do not recommend this place to anyone because it's becoming a negative place. ",2,Current Employee,Front End Service Associate ,"Bakersfield, CA",8/6/21,2021,8,6

Worst Company to work for,"If you would have asked me in 2017, I would have told you that Walmart is a fantastic company with great benefits. Within the last year this company has SPIRALED out of control. I was an associate on cap 2 and worked my way up to Team Leader of Apperal. The management did not guide me and give me any support. I was promised a fixed, set schedule that they lied to me and then after I repeatedly asked when i would have a set schedule they told me they just couldn't do it. I never touched apparel, I was forced to clean up after everyone else then go begin my job which I never had time to. This job comes with a lot of stress if you plan on moving up which it's not worth your time because it doesn't matter how good of a worker you are, the management is going to bring in their friends every single time and if you do wanna move up you gotta know somebody because they won't pick you unless they know they can use you and take advantage of you. Management is rude and lazy, they will never support you or follow up. They will throw you under the bus for their own mistakes to save themselves. They do not care about you, they look at their associates as bodies, you are replaceable. Ethics was called multiple times and interviews were done but no further investigation or anything was done about the unethical manor of this establishment. I wish you all the best.Also we had terrible benefits, we use to have great Healthcare coverage and then which switch company's which, for example, I had a tonsillectomy done which i was then billed for 7 different services medically and the insurance covered - more...",1,Former Employee,Team Leader ,"Middlefield, OH",8/5/21,2021,8,5

Good temporary job due to benefits and time off but avoid as a long term career.,"One of the most stressful and demoralizing places to work. Management gets criticized when being hands on and working in their department, for not meeting deadlines with projects, not helping other departments such as cashiers and online pickup, not stocking their department, not cleaning their department, not having an organized backroom.....and the list goes on. Horrible culture due to the bull**** that trickles down from the top. Departments are understaffed and employees are expected to be trained across completely different parts of the store. You may have been hired as a produce stocker but you will be thrown in extreme temperatures to push carts or dispense for ogp.You do get health insurance, sick days, paid vacation time, and bonuses so its still better than many retail/food service jobs but don't make it a career if you value your physical and mental health.",1,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 2 Supervisor ,"Weatherford, TX",8/5/21,2021,8,5

Management is terrible ,"Back when I first started, I was a full-time worker and got my 40 hours a week, and while it was third-shift menial labor (stocking), it was a solid paycheck. I was cool with that. But as the years rolled on, Walmart found that hiring two part-time workers instead of one full-time worker is much more profitable because they can deny benefits to any part-time worker and cut that person's hours to zero if they feel like it. They have done that to me, and they will do that to you if you work for them.",2,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Suwanee, GA",8/5/21,2021,8,5

Very flexible and great employee benefits/compensation with fun relaxed atmosphere.,"I loved working as a sales floor associate in TLE (Automotive.) My boss and coworkers were all very helpful, nice, and encouraging. Only thing I did NOT like was always having to do the job of at least 2 service writers over 50% of the time, due to high turn around and always being short staffed. Mainly because the pay rate for the service writer position (very stressful, complicated, and restrictive) was no higher than the much easier, way less stressful, fun, and enjoyable sales floor associate position (which I was hired for but only got to do half of the time.)

Nobody trains you to learn the systems and half of them are pointless.  Nobody wants to work there and its awful.  You very quickly realize your talents and skills and college education mean nothing and you better fall in line and follow the boring process or get out.

Ugh. ,"I worked at Walmart for 3 years, I loved my job at first I was always early, stayed late, my crew was my family. But management keeps changing, the rude ones stay the good ones go. I got a promotion a year and a half in as the ACC DM, loved it till management was screaming all the time. My assistant manager was never back in my department so I had to cover his paperwork alone with mine and the shop. Couldn’t be mad at him, because someone had to run the front end, had to unload the truck, or this or that. The schedule (which later up I ended up doing because my boss didn’t have time for) was a mess I had to stay on my counter most of the day, because there was no coverage. My guys, thankfully helped me with freight or covering the counter when we’re slow because I got pulled up front to run register or I got pulled work in another department while mine was falling apart. And I would get yelled at for that !",1,Former Employee,Automotive Department Manager ,Ohio,8/4/21,2021,8,4

Most of the co-workers I had talked about me behind my back and the managers were terrible. If I was shopping there on a day off they would ask me to work.

Doesn't care about employees,The management is terrible and doesn't try to build up the employees or make sure they have the equipment to do their job properly. The hours for all the employees are always being cut especially around bonuses which is taxed so by the time you get the check with the bonus it's the same as it's been. With cut hours the store becomes short staffed but the same amount of work is expected of the few individuals as a full staff. When bad managers are put over certain departments and it causes a high turn over in that area they don't see that the new manager might be the problem.They don't make the employees aware of their rights within the company or legal one's so they can't exercise them. When people ask for more hours they force them to widen their availability and making the times inconsistent it makes it hard to work a second job around. They offer health insurance that can only be used when a certain amount of hours get worked but when used hours are cut again and can no longer use it. Raises are supposed to be given every six months based on evaluations and they don't give them. They just say they were bad. They are supposed to be signed by the employee when done but aren't. Some managers get the associates numbers and harass them about work on their days off. When they aren't cutting hours the employees wanting full time will get full time hours but not the status so that way they can't get certain benefits. On top of all that they let the customers treat associates poorly and get away with theft.

"good for first time working ever, bad for long term","the work i did was fine and i got paid for it. the only things i didnt like was clear favoritism, and over working. but that was at my walmart as there is barely anyone working (for a good reason) and your almost always doing a job that clearly isnt what you applied for.",2,Former Employee,Walmart cart pusher ,"Plano, TX",8/3/21,2021,8,3
Walmart sucks since Sam Walton died.,Management sucks. They work you to death and you only get an eleven cent raise a year. They will lie in your face about everything.

Stability ,It’s a good company with advancement if you want it. Can get crazy at time but it is never truly terrible. Everything depends on what store you are at. The most frustrating thing is the customers. They can be rude and it can be hard to keep your mouth shut. ,3,Current Employee,Team Lead ,Arkansas,8/3/21,2021,8,3
Very negative place to work,Productivity is all that matters to management. Very negative atmosphere with poor management. You get reviewed and its always about how you need to be at 100% always leaving the office depressed and unmotivated cause they never give any encouragement.

"The managers and employees are worse than the customers, especially the managers","The managers never seem to care about you as long as the work is done. They overwork you and never show any type of appreciation whenever you stay later than your scheduled end shift time. Managers/Coaches/Team Leads are constantly talking trash about the employees all while they stand around and do absolutely nothing in a group. I’m one of the nicer associates at this store & have never gotten a complaint from a customer, but I’m surrounded by employees that have the worst attitude ever. Avoid Walmart on 190th and Normandie. Extremely unorganized and all the associates there are overworked and no one is able to receive any equipment or scanners. The worst walmart ever, in my opinion.",1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Torrance, CA",8/3/21,2021,8,3

"Most days are filled with hard work, co-workers are great but upper management were not great.","Most days would be a 3000 piece truck, unload that and stock. The leaders would help and even our manager would help us out while still doing her manager tasks. My co-workers were always helping each other as upper management would sometimes kick us down, not literally but they gave us many grueling and almost impossible tasks. Such as unloading two 35000 trucks and still stocking all of the pallets on the other truck. ",4,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Dawsonville, GA",8/3/21,2021,8,3

At least it’s a job,"I honestly could care less about this company. I only work here to pay my bills. The management is pretty much non existent. There is no type of rewarding feeling for working for this company. You are literally just a number working for a massive corporate that could care less about you. There’s hardly ever any overtime offered so you’re pretty much stuck making the same amount of money every 2 weeks which by the way isn’t very much.  Coworkers are rude, disrespectful, and judgmental. There’s a lot of young people that work here and the atmosphere reminds me of high school. I wouldn’t suggest working for Walmart if you can find something better. If you’re anything like me and you just needed a job during a difficult time then it’s decent. I have no plans or desires to work for this company long term. I don’t hate working here but I plan on leaving soon. ",2,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Bradenton, FL",8/2/21,2021,8,2
Short of staff and not great management,"The biggest problem in this Walmart is that they are understaffed. It is too crowded and that is why it's always lead to late break or lunch.

A Company That Is Trying to Rise (Somewhat) with the Times.,"I have been in many labor-intensive occupations, and this order-filling job is no exception.It's not a terrible occupation, but if you're not accustomed to working consistently hard and well per all protocols, you will not be a happy camper! You will always struggle. **It is most certainly not meant to be a cake walk.***You need to set your mind and body to the task at hand, for 12 hours per day, Consistently. This is a mental and physical level that management will give you 12 weeks to rise to.I will say this: achieving production goals can be very, very difficult and trying because of all the work **variables** present. You will get stuck with work others have no desire to do: switching empty pallets out for refilled ones, ducking and reaching over, under and around the module bays to grab and tag cartons, many extremely heavy that will seem even heavier because of the awkward and off-balance positions you will find yourself in. All of this and more affect production goals, as well as your stamina. Variables that you won't necessarily get credit for as you try to attain corporate goals.**If you want to challenge yourself in this particular environment, try it. You may indeed rise above the rest  with plenty of hard effort, due diligence, and paying good attention to corporate and industrial protocols.**",4,Current Employee,Order Filler/Picker ,Freetown Road,8/2/21,2021,8,2

For starters, I am a regular sales associate, but I am given tasks that are above my pay grade and am not compensated for the work I put in.

The people that survive at their jobs are pretty good.,"Not a bad job - keep active and keep moving - the time goes by quickly.  Antiquated policies and procedures can make you shake your head.  The defined objectives for the job are only 5% customer friendly.  The goals for the tasks asked upon you are low and repetitive.  This means doing the same objective over and over again because the standard is so low.For those people who are not younger or have physical limitations, this involves doing a repetitive task that neither helps sales or makes anything more efficient.  It also hurts.  Your back, your knees, all of you will hurt from the inefficient process that Wal-Mart employs.No training, no support... with an exception:  The co-workers that tough it out will be the best people you meet at Wal-Mart.  They will give you great advice but also predict your doom.  Management won't waste their time trying to help you because 80% of new hires will quit out of frustration in the first month.

Management was rude, petty, underhanded, unsavory, atrocious.Only good thing was a fair chunk of my coworkers.Also during the Pandemic they did not care about people getting out of their cars or not wearing masks, ect.",2,Former Employee,Digital Personal Shopper ,"Mesa, AZ",8/1/21,2021,8,1
"Easy, relaxed. They will hire just about anyone. ",As a sales associate the job is easy enough. It should be for the ridiculous $11/hr they pay. You can expect to work outside of your department and also expect to do the job of higher paid employees ( like unload the truck). There are opportunities to advance but you have to be willing to not care about what hours you work or what they make you do. I know at my store they made a team lead go out and push carts 90+ degrees.,3,Current Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Richmond, VA",8/1/21,2021,8,1

Productive bit unnoticed ,"The most enjoyable part of working here is probably going to be your coworkers. They will understand you better than anyone else and you’ll form lasting friendships.

Walmart Speaks For itself,"As an employee I learned that the people around you, your coworkers are the best to have. I had an Assistant Manager who listened to us and always defended our back at all Costs. Ever since they switched Management it’s been very rough, they say they would have help and until this day majority of our hardworking team have left and started hiring new workers and pretty much gave nothing beneficial about being motivated to work. Our Assistant Manager left and pretty much we had to run our own department. Not to mention for Job Code. If you were specifically to be assigned to one department I would assume to do that Job only. They made us do all their work (without at least instructing how to do it correctly) & you would be in trouble for not doing it on time. All I can say to this specific Walmart is to listen to our people! We are humans too & if you hear our voices just maybe we could all be a team player but for now. You guys would have to suck it up and don’t expect a bonus if you guys can’t help our people out. Forgot to mention if you just started don’t expect you can go on a vacation your PTO takes a long time to increase . Calling out is an option but they have up to 5 points once you hit that mark your out. ",1,Former Employee,Digital shopper ,"Tampa, FL",7/31/21,2021,7,31

"OK Job, especially for high schoolers","Work was okay but repetitive, got along great with my coworkers and you start accusing PPTO/Sick time from day one. The worst part of the job was dealing with the salaries management who thought they were better then any hourly associate and would tell you that something is a policy and we can’t do it but would then come up when a customer complained and break the policy and tell you that it’s okay and you should’ve done it for the customer in front of the customer and then tell you that you’re wasting their time. They were always adding more orders to be fulfilled even as the department got understaffed which created more work load for everyone else, they did offer OT because of this however. Salaried management only cares about their metrics not their associates. Pay was decent, for the job, $14 to start but no raises and no bonuses. No opportunities for advancement since they restructured management. They hire anyone that has a heartbeat. ",2,Former Employee,Digital Team Associate ,"North Huntingdon, PA",7/31/21,2021,7,31
New updates to warebouse ruined culture,"When I started a year ago I loved my job! When the company rolled out a new computer system 3 months ago it was not ready to be implemented on the distribution level.  The resulting ""training and implementation"" turned quickly into a nightmare of numbers where labor costs skyrocketed and production was nil.  The company then restructured its attendance policy and people began losing their jobs... The company changed again introducing a protected form of PTO for ""When life happens"" but kept changing the policies around when or how you could use it... more people lost their jobs.  There is no stability, no sense of job security, I go into work with a ""any mistake could be my last"" mentality and I now dread my job.",2,Current Employee,Packer/Picker ,"Haslet, TX",7/31/21,2021,7,31

Even the Coached an Team Leads will favor employees an have there points removed from the days they call out.There's still so much more I could say, more personal an deeper situations but just know this at Walmart as long as the job gets done they don't care.....if it's two people or just one an no matter how hard you work, if they don't like you they will coach you out.",1,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Palatka, FL",7/31/21,2021,7,31

Work at Walmart if you are desperate ,The management will attack you for their own mistakes and the company is constantly short staffed. Prepare to repeatedly say yes sir or ma’am and keep your head down to avoid stress. The work is boring and there is almost no way to move up without having all responsibilities and blame placed on you. Despite all that it is very easy to get hired so if you are in desperate need of money or need to work and gain some experience this may be for you (though there are probably other better companies you could shoot for),2,Former Employee,Stocking Associate ,"Clovis, CA",7/31/21,2021,7,31

It’s ok as long as you have a good manager,"The work was fine and made time pass quickly, but almost all of the department supervisors were horrible. More often than not I got pulled to other departments and later caught an earful because of it. I wasn’t taught much of anything and had to learn from coworkers, and was often left alone to do tasks I’d never done before. All in all it wasn’t terrible but if they actually trained everyone correctly and had someone that can make set schedules it would’ve been a lot less stressful.

People who are lazy stay there and get off scott-free when they putz around all day, while people who actually work are pushed to their mental and physical limits and taken for granted.

They request too much from a single person and expect it to be done within your 8 hour shift. They do not want to give over time and will send you home if you have any. They gave us a pay raise, but cut everyone’s hours and fired half of the employees that worked.

Good pto. Bad cell phone policy. 6 ten minute calls during 11 hours of driving time. Hard to have a relationship only talking 60 minutes while driving, even with Bluetooth. If you have an accident and you're over the minute limit, it's automatic termination. Automatic termination for texting while driving too, but that's understandable.

You mostly get out what you put in.,I’d say Walmart taught me that if you’re a great worker with a can do attitude that you’ll get taken advantage of and underpaid/overworked. If you barely do anything they won’t fire you because you’re a better employee than not having a worker.

Management can be disorganized and you often feel like just a number,"Overall good for someone who needs flexible hours but can be stressful. It ranges from boring to fast-paced, it really just depends on the day. Stay on top of management if you need to use your pto or you request dates off. They tend to “forget” about these things and then make you feel as if you’re inconveniencing them if you speak up about it.

Great place to work,Not a bad place to work. Life and work balance could be better but being that no one wants a job currently the staff is very short in stocking. This job is more suited for younger employees.,3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Forsyth, IL",7/30/21,2021,7,30
Not the best environment. ,Managers are power hungry. I’ve witnessed upper management press for good hearted managers to be mean or rude to their team. They want upper management to bully their teams to “get the best” out of them not realizing this creates the exact opposite. It’s sickening. ,2,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Pineville, LA",7/30/21,2021,7,30
Priorities can be skewed ,"In my experience with 3 stores, the policies in place hardly support associates with disabilities or medical problems, and management ignores any serious medical issues without a disabilities claim through their system. Very ableist ",2,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Aurora, CO",7/30/21,2021,7,30
The perfect High school job; but that’s all.,"This job was perfect for having to attend school and wanting to make some extra money on the side. But as you mature, you realize that you are surrounded by children. And suddenly $600-$700 isn’t enough to move out with anymore. They can easily over work you in a heartbeat.

overall good job,I worked in Walmart pharmacy for a year and all of my coworkers were like family to me in the pharmacy. you had good days and you had some bad days like any other job.

Wouldn't recommend working here,"Long hours or no hours at all. No training. Lots of higher ups complaining but never telling you what your actually doing wrong, so you can't fix it.

Overall good job besides the managers,"This job was good in the sense of pay, hours (most of the time), and the people there are cool. But when it comes down to the managers they’re very very strict about a job that isn’t that strict. They yell at you for the little things and expect you to be perfect all the time.

It was nice at first..,"The store I worked at had cash registers when I first started then they switched to full self check out. I hated that because you had to stand around until someone needed help. Customers complained about it all the time, like just imagine you have a cart full of groceries and only able to use self check out. Also, the store manager was rude anytime you had a question she’d blow you off and say figure it out or ask your TL even though the TL wasn’t there at the time.

"Good place, just not a good fit for me",I'm biased because I have issues with light and noise but the pay at my store is pretty good for my position.

There is no drama, everyone knows their expectations, you just do the work and get it done.

Pretty much what you would expect ,A job at Walmart is pretty much what you would expect. I was a cashier and it was pretty Mandane. Not very exciting or enjoyable but it was a job straight out of school and it was the bare minimum what I needed at the time. You will get paid appropriately for your work because you are not doing much work and it is an entry-level job. Do not expect a middle class salary because you are not working for middle-class wages you are working the job that a highschooler should get after school. Don’t expect much because it isn’t much. Do you have to be there 90 days to get the discount card benefits and PTO so if you’re in it for the long game then you might enjoy the benefits but I was not there long. All in all a good transition job,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Liberty, MO",7/29/21,2021,7,29
Miserable work life,The work sucks and they work you like a dog but the pay is pretty good for what you do. Really depends on what walmart you work at because they are all different.

It’s Ok,Was ok place to work. Management was okay. Sometimes they’d handle things and sometimes they wouldn’t. There were a lot of new people hired almost every day.

Okay company depending on location. ,Management can be very uncaring and even talk about bad about other associates. I’ve done all three shifts and for the most part it’s fairly easy to learn. Benefits and pay are very good and is probably the best part of working for them. If you get a store with great management the jobs are worth it. ,2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Denver, CO",7/29/21,2021,7,29

Walmart's Company Culture Is Psychopathic,You are a cog in a machine and you will be reminded of this with increasing levels of sadism as you are promoted in the company.

Bad pay,I’m currently a cart pusher and was promised a raise but still have yet to see it. They get after us for taking a break after being in the hot sun.

Good place to start working at if you have no retail experience,"I've been working at Walmart for 4 years. I've gotten along with all managers and co-workers so I rarely ever had serious issues with anyone while I was at work. I worked part time because I'm a college student, so I was given the opportunity to work a certain shift a few times per week while I get my assignments done throughout the week for my online classes. You're able to speak to your managers about any issue or concerns you have. Sometimes your hours do get cut for some weeks, but the managers will take that into account and fix your schedule, especially if they know that you have good work ethic and are responsible with your job. I always got the chance to talk to my managers and I was given the help when I needed help. You are also able to learn about various departments while working for one department as well.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Secaucus, NJ",7/28/21,2021,7,28
I didn't  like  it ,No training  they just yell  and  order  you  to  do  the dirty  work.  Co workers  take  extra  long breaks  and  disappear  for  hours.  Its not  a  good  environment. ,1,Former Employee,Production Worker ,"Rock Springs, WY",7/28/21,2021,7,28
Terrible place to work for,I have worked for walmart 4 times only thing worth it is the paychecks. They fired me with 3 occurences after a job protected leave after having a fever and being sent home for COVID-19 precautions...only had 3 occurences/points have to be at 5 to be fired. Was also paid 3 dollars less an hour than I was supposed to. Management is poor... Could give zero care if you're hurt on the job or sick.. they make you do work that's not your responsibility including management jobs... they over work you and there is zero work life balance. I recommend not to work here even with it sounding good for the money per hour.,1,Former Employee,Overnight Team Associate ,"Johnson City, NY",7/28/21,2021,7,28
Good Stepping Stone,"The management isn't the best, most of them are hypocritical and two faced. Favoritism is huge here, and at times it really plays out for the best to be ""teachers pet"".  There's no clear communication anywhere in the store and a lot ends up ruahed last minute which puts strain on us regular employees. The few things that make this worth while is the LiveBetterU program for full time associates and the 10% general discount. ",3,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Port Charlotte, FL",7/28/21,2021,7,28
Great??? Expectations ,Walmart demands way too much from each person.  They move a person from job to job within your dept & expect a person to cover work far beyond what one person can handle.  I did not like working there at all!!!,3,Former Employee,Part-time Fresh Dept Employee ,"Mason City, IA",7/28/21,2021,7,28
Underpaid while new hires get more $$$,"If you've been working with the company for years, you only get a tiny raise compared to the new hires. There's no advancement in management because Walmart's new structure does not allow for growth. No incentives. Walmart itself needs to change. Their system is totally backward when it comes to taking care of people who've been with the company for years.",1,Current Employee,Associate ,"Denver, CO",7/28/21,2021,7,28
Could be good dependent on store location and department hired for.,"During my time employed it was ok, and I worked in the produce department. They kept changing how inventory and product rotation was done hoping to employees processes and procedures with less employees on hand. Now you will have employees that work multiple fresh food departments throughout the day due to shorthanded shift even prior to the hit of Covid-19 pandemic. Have to use 3rd party to approve any call outs due to illnesses or emergencies, and can be very difficult to get that company and doctors office to work together to make sure all needed paperwork is completed and turned in within set in frame. Can point out easy with small attendance point system, but can earn pilings back every six month. Everyone is part-time unless in management, and they will make sure monthly worked/scheduled hours average out below 35 hrs to ensure no change in status from part time to full time so that health benefits are not offered. However, health benefits that they do offer are not worth the money wasted, and better to get from the market place.",4,Former Employee,Fresh Produce Associate ,"Talladega, AL",7/28/21,2021,7,28
"Good pay for new job hunters, terrible management ","As a high schooler, this job was great because I was making $13 an hour in ogp and my hours were pretty consistent. However, my boss/store management was something I don’t wish on anyone to deal with. If you put in certain availability they ignore it and when I would request off for school functions (prom, graduation, etc.) they were all denied. I eventually almost pointed out because I had to keep calling out when my manager wouldn’t give me the days off I needed (which is also why I needed up quitting). Ogp is the only place I would recommend working. Stocking is thankless, cashier is drone like, cap 2 is exhausting, and overnight anything will mess with your head. Nothing about Walmart is worth working there unless you get into grocery pickup and also have a good manager. Management really can make or break your job and Walmart has a track record of consistently bad management. If I were you, I’d just play it safe and stay far away.

Not what it use to be,"I loved my job at first but now Walmart has decided to cut down on staff and put more duties on the people they do have causing more stress and more occurrences of burnout.

My schedule was supposed to be 3/11's a week and it easily turned into that plus 2 overtime days, 1 10hr shift and the 2nd an 8hr shift and then every other Saturday on top of that.

Not great ,"I enjoyed the work there, I planned on making a career out of my time there. However I ended up hospitalized in March and later in May I got fired for missing those days since I didn't have the PPTO to cover it.

Favoritsm,"In our store, our store manager is nice and hardworker and  fairly but some coach and team lead are mean and rude with others . And if you are not favorite (even the guy are lazy and alaways walking around and using cellphone during working hours not job related , excessive breaktime, and they can choose what they want to work) they always gonna yell at you and alway looking at your miistake and not apprciate what you did.

My personal experience was a mixed bag. ,"My experience likely wasn't the norm, but some of my bosses (One in particular) was completely awful and made you feel overwhelmed, over taxed and insulted most of the time. They'd also go out to their car to sleep for literal entire shifts, while pushing us to do more and more tasks. Luckily does not work there now, but some bosses weren't much better. The job does fairly pay well, but it varies on how much it's really worth compared to the work, which could vary from mind-numbingly easy to overwhelmingly difficult and stressful.Co-workers were nice, and certain members of management were great-- Made it feel actually enjoyable to work there. But the balance between good and bad definitely whined sometimes.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance ,"Terrell, TX",7/28/21,2021,7,28

Management does not seem to care about employees ,In my time with this company I was treated very poorly when it came to managers/team leaders. Employees I worked with would often slack off on duties and I would be left to pickup said slack. Which is fine. But the point I started having an issue with it was when I would get in trouble for duties not being met while I am was the only one doing most of the work. ,2,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Williston, ND",7/28/21,2021,7,28

If you can find the right Walmart it's a great place to work,A typical day at work there is pretty cool it's fun it's laid back it's one place I will tell you you will learn a lot because you're dealing with hundreds of people everyday on a daily basis which means you have a lot of different personalities and each day you learn how to deal with each and every one of them the hardest part of the job is just keeping your calm and you're cool cuz some people really try to push your buttons to make you come out of your character but really that's the only hardest part of that job and the most enjoyable part of the job is during holidays because that's when you see the best come out of people I can say Walmart is a good place to work if you can find the right store with the right managers,5,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Baton Rouge, LA",7/27/21,2021,7,27

Management is terrible ,"Worked here during covid. We were very short staffed and none of the numerous managers would bother to help or train new people, even if repeatedly asked. The higher ups did nothing with concerns brought to them either. The HR person takes everything personally too, so don't you dare call out.

The pharmacy that I worked at declined significantly. Quality of staffing has declined drastically. Hiring of rookie techs that have no clue what they are doing plus pharmacists that micromanage so much and get overbearing put so much more stress.

Policies we're not followed and then I was informed that there wasn't time for that specific task but was never trained or shown anything other than 4-5 things to work on.  Was temp position and when workers returned I was relieved of work and told performed job as needed and was eligible for rehire when I asked at exit interview yet after submitting application for several positions was never contacted...for any reason I did have 3 days absence but did call into company as required and even well before amount of time required.  Maybe this played a roll in not gaining another position, idk because was told eligible for rehire.

Nice place,Work hard and keep your mouth shut! The environment is  a good one but make sure you open up to people who understand you better. The most important thing you can do is know as many people as possible. Especially those in Management ,4,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Mankato, MN",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Great place to work ,Great place to work! I enjoyed it; made a lot of friends! I started off as a cashier and move into a money center cashier. You get a 10% discount. Managers are very friendly.,4,Former Employee,Money Center Cashier ,"Hammond, LA",7/26/21,2021,7,26
It’s Walmart,"It’s Walmart, it isn’t terrible but at the same time it isn’t great. My management was great, but it’s still Walmart. If you are in need of a job, this is the one for you. ",3,Current Employee,OPD ,"Hot Springs, AR",7/26/21,2021,7,26
"Toxic environment, manipulative, petty","It is supposed to be an “open door” but the person who is supposed to be “neutral” is the one who tells all your business of starts rumors. Management is who makes the work place toxic. Employees are there for each other but management pins one another against each other. They don’t care about the well being of the employee. They have a attendance policy given 9 min after scheduled shift time to clock in if you clock in at 10 min after you get half a point. If you miss a day of work it’s a full point. If it’s a “key date” (which is typically holidays, days they perceive will be busy& high demand) its double points. Constantly stretching their employees with poor scheduling for coverage across the board. Expect employees to be robots and if they don’t like you they will find a way to get you fired or so fed up with being ridiculed you quit. I’ve only worked for one location I can’t speak for other ones but this location is definitely in need of a wake up call. It’s sad that there has been several complaints to corporate but nothing seems to be done. Day after day employees complain about being talked down to or being nit picked at for little things. Definitely has room for improvement. The good employees do not get the recognition they deserve they are treated worse and expected more and more out of each day so much that they end up leaving the company so you you not forced out the door you’re fired. The good employees deserve better pay for what some of the employees have to do, endure,  and accomplish in one shift I don’t feel is fair they should be compensated for their skill - more...",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Greensboro, NC",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Soul crushing Job ,"The workload is constantly being increased without any accommodations. No matter how hard you try you won't be acknowledged. The ones that are deemed as ""favorites"" get advancement opportunities regardless of skill or ability. Management likes to use distraction techniques to mitigate workplace issues. Walmart as a temporary job is fine. I would not recommend that anyone makes a career out of the place. ",2,Current Employee,Stock Associate ,"Rochester, NY",7/26/21,2021,7,26
"A busy Job, Must Love working in all kinds of weather, Must Have High stress Tolerance.","Worked as a Cart Attendant for a good while, I enjoyed my time and work there, met a lot of great people, this job helped me develop as a person on a personable aspect in regards to learning by servicing my community. Company benefits were good but not the best. Management was good but not perfect. I only wish the pay for the job was better specially now due to high risk of catching covid at this job (retail in general).",4,Former Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Haines City, FL",7/26/21,2021,7,26
