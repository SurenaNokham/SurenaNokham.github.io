Horrible management and no way for promotion or benefits,I was constantly berated for tasks i was not involved in. Constant schedule changes with almost no notice. Disrespectful and useless management that kept the store as a whole from being productive.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Mansfield, TX",10/12/18,2018,10,12
Fun and mature workplace with friendly management and employees,"A typical day consists of clocking in, talking to and helping customers, and talking to management if any issues arise with my schedule or anything else. I've learned to develop my communications skills and learned to work hard, positively, and to be clean, fast, and friendly to move up. The management at Walmart are very flexible and understanding when it comes to school and other important activities. The workplace has a big and very comfortable break room. Otherwise, there is plenty of space to work with. The hardest part of the job would be customers who are impatient or rude. It usually takes extra time to help them and show them that I am trying my best to help them. The most enjoyable part are the nice and friendly customers who come in and make my day better just by smiling and saying thank you.",5,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pontiac, IL",10/12/18,2018,10,12

"Very high-stress job, but with benefits","I only work part-time as a full-time student. As a bakery fresh associate, my colleagues and I have a tight schedule to follow. We need to have a certain amount of fresh baked goods to be displayed. As part of the job, we need to be always attentive and aware of costumers that might be in need of help, whether they can't find a product of they need to place an order. Management is quite helpful and will assist when in need of help. The hardest part about the job is that is very stressful, every day and every week can be totally different from the other. As well, associates don't really have a fixed schedule, depending of their availability too. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discounts, you are never bored.",4,Current Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Morehead, KY",10/12/18,2018,10,12

Fresh cap brockport,"Managers are never around. They will tell you how to do things when they havent done them and when you explain common sense things they get mad and find more tasks for you that they are supposed to do.

Very stressful workplace,"The prevailing culture at Walmart is compliance achieved through intimidation. You constantly have to or are reminded to, watch your back. Even the computer messages you receive when you punch in and out are threatening. Recent message seen: check to see if you have CBL's to complete.  ""YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE"". It's extremely stressful. I've worked at other Walmarts out of state, but they were not like the West Charleston Store #3473. There is also a tremendous amount of favoritism and nepotism at this particular location. In addition, management does not provide the basic tools and supplies to do your job.

"Poorly Managed, low pay, low hours","I liked the work I did at Wal-Mart, but quickly found it was more work than the pay or hours were worth.

Days are very busy and there are many applications you must learn to work with the different issues that are presented to the cashiers daily. I have learned you can never have enough of patience.

The perfect place to work if your aunt is the boss.,In Puerto Rivo people who have big positions bring all their family members in to the big positions ONLY. If you dont have a family menber with a high position they will overlook anyone qualified and give the position to their family member. Our stoe manager gave the award of employee of the year to her family member that was working in the store for 6 months only she also gave that person a raise and a higher position at 6 months in the company. And there are worst situations  of high positions given to people who do not have the experience or the college degree.

They need to seriously redo their entire system from the ground up.,"As far as the workload itself goes, its not so bad. My other coworkers were great and were great people, but some members of management created a hostile, and stressful work environment so bad that many times throughout the day their shenanigans made it almost impossible to get the work done that was necessary. They also expect you to do everything on time by the end of your shift, which if you only have one or two people working the whole area it's pretty much impossible even if you try your absolute hardest. They will openly admit to micromanagement, and they won't admit to this but some members of management harass employees to a pretty deteriorating degree. All in all, I wouldn't work there unless you really need the money, or you have a wonderful work experience there, which doesn't seem to happen often.",1,Current Employee,Fresh Production Associate ,"Longview, WA 98632",10/10/18,2018,10,10

They pretend the associates are a walmart family but they treat you as if you’re not human. You’ll mostly be at work then at home and they have a point system where you can get fired for calling out for a real emergency.

It was a good part time job while I was looking for something better.,"Working at Walmart is difficult to describe.  I preferred to work when fewer managers were working.  I could focus on my department (Sporting Goods) and I believe that translated into more sales by me.  I had repeat customers coming to my department just to do business with me because I could give them good information.  But, managers just need a body to fill in a hole which meant my department was left with no clerk.   I thought that was counter productive to sales and to the customers.

Its a big store, with a high turn over rate so it I kinda felt like you never really got to know anyone before they left.

Not as bad as people make it out to be but still not a good job.,It's an ok job. Management was generally nice but also inept at their job which made it straining for the regular associates. I guess the best part about Walmart but also it's biggest flaw is that Walmart will pretty much hire anyone. So your co-workers will be the luck of the draw. Also Walmart generally won't fire people no matter how bad they are at their jobs. They'll most likely only fire people for gross misconduct or attendance.

Walmart is a great company don't get me wrong...,Walmart is a pretty cool company to work for and they really care about their employees it really depends on the location of the store. The Wal-mart I was located at unfortunately was not a very great location. They were severely under staffed and most of the daytime-evening employees just walked around doing what they wanted most of the time. Customers complained a lot and we never really had the items that they were looking for or was suppose to be in stock. The overnight crew didn't really have those problems but was still very under staffed so we had to speed through our assigned departments be sent to 2-3 different departments just to make sure all the stocking was complete it was kind of stressful. But like I said other than the location I was at Walmart is a great company and hey you get a hour lunch so thats cool.,2,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"St. Louis, MO",10/9/18,2018,10,9

What a second job to have while going to college,Honestly working for the Vincennes Walmart was good to keep me busy on the weekends to make sure that I didn't get into any trouble by chance with living in a college town. I've met some really good people while working there and they have helped me go through not only my emotional journey and financial Journey in bettering myself as a person in general.

Worst job experience EVER!,"When I had the interview at WalMart I was told by the hiring manager that I would be hired full-time and I would be given an endless amount of hours and that is why I accepted the job. I had like a week of full-time hours and after that I got cut down to working three days a week for like 4-5 hours. Not to mention the staff was horrible. As far as the CSM's they were lazy and they made us cashiers scared to ask for their help when there was a problem.

I learned the basics of optics there. I got along with the management.  I was able to take my kids to work with me if I needed to and one time I had to take my dog to the vet and since it was in the opposite direction of where I worked and was going to have to call off they let me bring her to work with me and every on won (except the dog) the hart part of the job was one owner could not keep his hands to himself. the mo enjoyable pat of the job was he people I met I have people I still keep in touch with",4,Former Employee,Optician ,"Cambridge, OH",10/5/18,2018,10,5
"Horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE!!!!","Of all the jobs I could have had, I strongly and passionately regret taking this one. I've heard of Walmart horror stories but I always believed it was an exaggeration. Now, I realize Walmart is literally the WORST job anyone could ever have. Actually, the job itself is very easy, there is not much guesswork, but the managers there are an entire different story. Walmart has a sort of motto they go by to always respect each other and the customers. They also have an open door policy, and of those two things, neither one are upheld. The managers will treat you as if you were a piece of gum that got stuck under their shoe and when you express your concerns or discomfort they go out of their way to coach you later on and eventually fire you since you can only receive four of these coachings, the fourth being your termination. You go into work here every morning worried about whether or not you'll finish your shift without a problem. Everyday you wake up wishing you didn't need this job as desperately as you did to still be working there so you could just turn back around and sleep, but you gather all your strength to get up and go in. And GOD FORBID you actually happen to be in a great mood there! The management goes completely out of their way to make sure that smile on your face doesn't exist by the end of the day, and then they coach you for not being productive because you spent too long helping a customer. If I could write this review seven billion times over to have this specific store shut down I would. Do Not Work Here. The pay is DEFINITELY not worth it.",1,Current Employee,CAP 1 Associate ,"Lanoka Harbor, NJ",10/5/18,2018,10,5

It a fun job to work. Besides the managers its not a stressful job depending on what position you're working,"Working at Wal-Mart is great. There's a lot of benefits you can get, the pay is amazing. You get bonuses 3 to 4 times a year. The management is very poor.

Good atmosphere,"Walmart has a great atmosphere when it comes to its associates. Everybody is kind and is willing to help or answer questions. The management however was not great at managing its associates. They would constantly be moving employees from department to department because they didn't have a solid plan on how to get everything done on time. They don't provide third shift with the tools to get their job done because some previous employees had lost tools on the shift, while allowing 1st and 2nd shift to access them. This resulted in slower work because employees can't find where items belong in stocking. They then write you up if you dont finish your area for a lack of productivity. It's 100% backwards and quite silly to be honest. Another thing worth mentioning is doctors notes don't mean anything to them, they won't even look at it. An associate I knew had a concussion and they told them,  ""I would recommend you miss work or you'll be terminated.""

Accommodating workplace,"Work days often meant pushing carts and lifting heavy objects for customers and other associates. I learned fairly quickly that my work was extremely important. If there were no carts inside the store, people would quickly leave without buying anything, and when a cart was not lined up outside the store or ready to be used inside, that meant it was likely blocking a parking space, which would also make customers leave._x000D_Concerning the management, they were very active. A lack of associates meant that all hands were always on deck, which in turn meant that every supervisor and even the manager herself were all very aware of what each associate had to do and could understand when it became difficult to accomplish a task. No one was ever wrongly reprimanded._x000D_The most difficult part of my job was easily collecting carts at a quick enough rate to match the speed at which they were used during the weekends and on holidays._x000D_Surprisingly, the most enjoyable part of the job had to be the collection of the carts itself.

Scheduling,"Walmart allows me to fix my schedule to where I work only days and will allow me unpaid days off to attend school events for my children.

A Mixed Bag,"While management was typically agreeable, sometimes company demands were not. If anyone called in sick, other people were expected to cover both their area and the other person's area. Sometimes this was with other people to get it knocked out quickly. Sometimes it was one person expected to get both areas done in one night. This would be mixed, depending on how heavy our stock was that night. This would cause stress for everyone and resentment when someone was just told ""You can get it done cause we need you to.""",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,Colorado,10/4/18,2018,10,4

Long work days with no real managerial support or praise,"Working at Walmart in my area really depends on the day of the week and how well we are scheduled which unfortunately is not well. Most days I have worked when it's been busy, and it's a known busy day, food stamps, social security, back to school, etc, we are almost always severely understaffed, and associates from the floor are called to the front to help cashiers causing the floor crews to suffer. On the flip side of that, days that are usually slow we have too many people working and are left standing around. Needless to say the busy days when stuff is not done, management scolds us for not working hard enough, and when days are slow and we're all done with our duties we're scolded for standing around. The hardest part of my job personally is getting all of my duties done, even on days that are slow. Customer service is meant to come first in our store, and when we put the customer first, we're putting some of our department duties to the side. This upsets managers and instead of helping departments that may be flooded with too many customers, they tell us that we just need to work harder and faster. The most enjoyable part of my job though, for me, was being able to give customers my honest opinion on products, games and what not and just having general conversations with them about these items. Customer's feel like they have a more personal experience with us, and in my experience, are more likely to come back to the store, buy more product, and even donate when we have donations going on for different causes.",2,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Indiana, PA",10/4/18,2018,10,4

A basic Understanding of a Job at Walmart,"As a company Walmart can be an exciting place to work and grow provided you have a good management team and support from your fellow associates. Benefits are very good compared to most companies in the Retail Sector. Training is circumspect. Management relies on a program labeled Pathways. its a 10 week program to ready the associate for their job on the sales floor. the plan itself on paper is good but it lacks a key ingredient , working with a trained associate. Management doesn't see it that way and that's why a good percentage of them quit or are let go.Pay raises were once based on an associates evaluation, now corporate has done away with that and gives every associate a 2-2.5% raise(annually) across the board to each and every associate , ultimately eliminating any incentive to do well.",2,Current Employee,Consumables Associate ,"Indian Trail, NC",10/4/18,2018,10,4

I would not work for Walmart again or refer any one else to work for Walmart unless they really needed a manageable paying job.,During my time at Walmart I feel as thought that management was working rather against you than for you and in a general seance  of getting the job done the most effective way.

The hardest part of the job is is unloading 3 trucks in on those hectic nights, other than that everything else that came with the job title came easy.

What you make of it.,"Could be an easy and fun job if it weren't for incompetent managers. Always poor coverage and they promote based on favoritism, not hard work.

If management likes you then they make sure you move around in the store.

They're often on call with upper management, and can't be bothered for at least an hour.  Some times the store manager just doesn't show up for a day._x000D__x000D_Speaking of scheduling, they are very inflexible.  I have stated that I can't work weekends or nights, as I often help my disabled father.

It's a job?,"I really do not want to bash Walmart as a whole, my store particularly had a lot of hard working and kind associates, but the management culture was to pick a few favorites, and advance them, leaving others to stay associates.  Accounting a time for example when 3 different associates with 3 or more years of experience were in line for the produce management position, someone was hired in with NO experience in retail what-so-ever to be department manager because of an agreement with upper management.  I know this is anecdotal, but it was one of the first nails in the coffin for me at Walmart, I knew at that point advancement probably wasn't an option.",3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Laurinburg, NC",9/30/18,2018,9,30

Productive and busy work environment,"My days at Walmart are always busy, faced pasted. I learn that with this job you have to have a lot of patience and back bone. The management can be strict sometimes but they just want whats best. It's really fun and I love all my peers.

Engagement & Associates,"Wal- mart can be an exciting & fun place to work for, however, store leaders need to be more engaged in their associates. Support & communicate change and make it a one on one interaction with certain associates who find it hard to understand the why' s behind the change. Follow up with your associates who have legitimate concerns. Walk side by side even when it is great, not only when there's opportunities. Celebrate the good and encourage associates, appreciate associates, drive a positive, trusting workforce.",4,Current Employee,PERSONNEL COORDINATOR ,"Sacramento, CA 95843",9/28/18,2018,9,28

Walmart isn't what it used to be,Since my time at Walmart I wouldn't go back to it. They have changed their policies so much that you may or may not see much in the way of hours and the ability to have any kind of work life will look small to you.,3,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Spring, TX",9/28/18,2018,9,28

Job Summary,Walmart was a good place to work I liked working with a lot of the associates. The only problem with Walmart was poor customer service. No one smiles when they talk to the customers. Not many associates to work and help out. greeters walk away from their doors when they are suppose to be greeting people they just talk with each other.,3,Former Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Neenah, WI",9/27/18,2018,9,27

great co workers but not enough hours,I have great co workers. I have managers that will listen to you and your concerns. Walmart has a starting pay of 11 dollars per hour but they don't give you enough hours to earn a decent living.  This place is for someone living at home with their parents. If you have bills and rent to pay then this is not the place to work.,2,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Dallas, TX",9/27/18,2018,9,27
stressfull,I worked their for five years I loved my job but also had times I hated it as well. the job is what you make of it. If you give it your all it well have rewards and if you come in with a I don't care attitude you well be stuck. Remember retail is detail and have a good attitude towards staff and consumers. Because at the end of the day that's why you'll have a job.,3,Former Employee,Walmart Associate / csm / stocker ,"Potosi, MO",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Safe and Available to promote fast,"It was a great job to work. Great benefits, hours. Its also a job where you could possibly work from being a cadhier to a manager at some point.

The employees are all very respectful and is dedicated to doing there job and serving their customers.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,Muskogee,9/27/18,2018,9,27
Low pay. Uptight managers,Always understaffed and I mean always so management expectations are way to high one person shouldn't be forced to do the job of multiple people. The wage isn't high basically pays less then the local McDonald's which is part of the reason we can't keep people as a Manger I can't even afford a 2 bedroom apt.,3,Current Employee,Department Manager Wal-Mart ,"Plattsburgh, NY",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Great benefits,The benefits are amazing but it’s like management doesn’t give you the option to promote unless they like you or you know someone.

Culture preaches how much associates are valued however management won't do anything for you.",3,Former Employee,Operations Intern ,"San Antonio, TX",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Overall it’s okay,Not the best place to work at but overall it can be an okay place to work and grow. But I believe advancement is very slim and hard to obtain at this company and in my case can be subjected to only favorites.,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Kingman, AZ",9/27/18,2018,9,27

It's an ok job to help you get by,"This job is great for kids right out of high school. Not for a person who is use to making a lot more money than what Walmart pays.

Its a great place to work for a first job,"It is very fast-paced /relaxed place to work depending on where you work. It teaches you a lot of thing such as what people are interested in depending on the season you're in. For me, the hardest part of the job was always wasting my money on food for lunch. The most enjoyable part of the job is just having a good time with co-workers and customers.",4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Victoria, TX",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Competitive/ productive,"They have unrealistic expectations, manager barely knew English and would talk bad about and discriminate against employees in front of them when bought to higher up nothing was done. expected regular employees to do management task without allowing them access to tools needed and would give disciplinary actions if not fulfilled",3,Former Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Helotes, TX",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Very Stressful,"I came in put my things in my locker, then put on my smock and came out to the sales floor to work. I went to my department. If my Department manager was there she would tell me what was going on and what I needed to do. Or what needed to be done. I showed the jewelry to customers cashed them out. stocked shelves. scan items to make sure they are the right price. Set mods. Do price changes. The managers don't really care about your home life. they care about the money that comes in. They don't believe in family comes first. the hardest thing about working there is that you don't stay in your own department because they pull you from department to department. Because they never have the right number of workers in each department. So they pull you to go to another department. The most enjoyable thing I liked working there is meeting the people. I am a sociable person and I love meeting people",2,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Shepherdsville, KY",9/27/18,2018,9,27
It's Wal-Mart what do you expect,It's about what you would expect from the largest retailer... You will be underpaid and the benefits will suck. You're a number and your corporate boss doesn't care about you unless you interfere with their bottom line. You'll work all holidays including like 3 o'clock start times for thanksgiving day. You should only use this job if you're in college or have no where else to go.,1,Former Employee,Service Attendant ,"Fort Collins, CO",9/27/18,2018,9,27

"Consistent hours,Good pay.","A typical day was bringing in all carts from parking lot, assisting customers with heavy items. I learned how too work with the public and be friendly, honest, and helpful. The management always explained things I didn't understand and helped me be more efficient.

It could be an enjoyable place to work but nothing is consistent each day and rule is different depending on who the manager is that night no real org,A typical day for me at Walmart starts with a meeting where they tell us how many trucks we have and how much fright is on each truck and let us know their expectations and goal plan. I do the same thing daily so nothing new to learn on this shift. Managers need to be on the same page with rules and regulations and hold associates accountable for what they do and don't do and not make it a group problem. There is no hard part and I love the work never a dull moment.,3,Current Employee,Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",9/27/18,2018,9,27

opinions and work experience,Working at Walmart was interesting because i met new and different people which i enjoy. The hardest part of the job was when we would get a customer that would be overly rude but I along with others who dealt with the same situation could deal with the problem and get the customer out in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk to the customers and getting to know different people. I loved getting to know what their likes were through the objects they were buying which would also start a conversation between customer and cashier. I learned that not all customers are as polite as you are or other customers. A typical day at work would consist of polite and rude customers and many hours of scanning and bagging and also returning objects to where they belong.,5,Former Employee,Associate ,"New Martinsville, WV 26155",9/27/18,2018,9,27

Hardest thing was stopping the shoplifter without any physical contact.",3,Current Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,Vancouver Wa,9/27/18,2018,9,27
Working at Walmart,I been working at walmart for 12 years . The company doesn't really care about the employees. They try to see what they can get out of you without paying the proper wage. Example; when going from first to third to help out there is no compensation for you switching. You get the same wage as you were for working first shift. There is never any coverage in other departments when other associates are on third. Therefore if you are working during the day you have to cover the departments. They plan poorly and lie to their employees about many things.,1,Current Employee,Manager ,"Cranston, RI",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Easy job to do,The only thing about Walmart is they don't allow you to get any over time the are always sending me home and I'm never on the clock because my over time has been met.,4,Current Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"LaGrange, GA",9/27/18,2018,9,27
A very active job with plenty challenges,"No matter the position you are placed at in at Walmart: there will always be something for you to learn and practice. There can be rushes when you are stocking, cleaning, or returning items to your department if there is a time restraint. The managers at my location were fair, respectable, patient, and generous that made it a comfortable place to be and were there for any help you might need with your area/customer. The bad thing comes with the customers who come in expecting only what they want and the managers sometimes give in no matter the company policy. Then there are the recent hour cuts that have come by after the recent raises for the year. Although there are various times where customers are very appreciative for the help you give them, even if the store didn't have what they needed. Altogether it is a tough job with ample challenges, it has it's upsides and pros when it comes to working for a super store like Walmart.",4,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Houston, TX",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Great first job,"It was a great first job for me, I was apart of a team called remix. We mainly did Inventory Control. When seasonal promotions came out we were the team to set things up. I loved the job. I was around 18 years old. It was fun and easy, as long as you work hard you will be fine.",4,Former Employee,Inventory Control Specialist ,"Orlando, FL",9/27/18,2018,9,27
No balance,"I found that the higher I got up int he company, the more they expected me to dedicate my life to the company.  I found that I had no work life balance, and while the salary, on paper looks great when breaking it down by how many hours I was actually working, it was a joke. To me, time with my family was more important so after two years of being a co-manager I decided to leave the company to pursue other opportunities.",2,Former Employee,Co Manager ,"Cleveland, OH",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Good first jon,This was a good first job but not long term never able to receive a full 40 hours and never respect your school schedule or any type of time off. There is no growth in the company,2,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Houston, TX",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Fun work space,Love Walmart fun people and customers. I loved all my CSM and also my coworkers. It was never a dull moment while I was working for Walmart. Mangers always use to help and interact once the frontend got busy and slammed with customers,5,Former Employee,CUSTOMER SERVICE/CASHIER ,"Tampa, FL",9/27/18,2018,9,27
fun work place,always made sure the registers was clean before the end of the night and had to clean before I started working. I always helped the supervisor out at the end with the money cart going around to each department and collect the money but the supervisor had to count the drawers down. anytime they asked me to go over customers service to help out with the line I did. helped the customers out all the time when they asked me a question I answered it.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Baltimore, MD",9/27/18,2018,9,27

Its good for what it is,"You get paid well enough. If you can stick it out long enough the benefits are outstanding.

Fun place to work,Wal-Mart is a great place to work because they are all about family. I never knew I would make so many friends.

We looked out for each other as well as the customers.,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Prosper, TX 75078",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Simple,"Management sucked. The company cares nothing about its employees hence “Save More, Live Better” that’s not for the customers or employees that’s for owners all the way down to the top manager. Don’t be fooled",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Nashville, TN",9/27/18,2018,9,27
throwing the truck and breaking down pallets,every day busy and we get more trucks during the holidays season we would get three trucks that we would have to empty and make a pallet for   those three trucks that would carry about 2000+ pieces and one pallet truck. The manager would send me to help my co worker if he is being attacked by a bunch of loose frates and he would take over my station in the mean time. Variety of different cultures how they interact with each other. The hardest part of the job is throwing the truck. The most enjoyable part is when i get off work i be so tired after a entire 12 hour shift.,4,Former Employee,Truck Unloader/Stocker ,"Valley Stream, NY",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Constricting working conditions,"My time at Walmart, for the most part, was satisfactory. However, the closer my departure from the company came, more problems began to arise. I continually received conflicting instructions from managers, who in turn, reprimanded me in turn for choosing between who’s orders to follow. This mainly came into play when concerning overtime.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Lakeland, FL",9/27/18,2018,9,27

Overall a great place,Your typical teenage job which gives you financial freedom to be able to buy whatever you want. For the most part it was okay and not bad except during holidays and back to school since customers would buy excessively and since you don't have a bagger you would have to check them out as well as bag everything on your own. Sometimes you get a rude customer which can result in ruining your entire day. Overall not bad but would suggest opening more registers when busy hours or helping bagging when lines start to get long.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Belton, TX",9/27/18,2018,9,27
Its always a busy day,"As a major store we always stayed super busy which made the days go by faster.

It's not as good as it seems.,"Walmart pays great! There are some amazing people that work at Walmart, but the management is so unbelievably horrible. The management teams belittle their associates, they play favorites, if they don't like you they will do everything they can to get you to quit or find anything to write you up. It's quite unprofessional. Now, don't get me wrong there are some amazing managers out there. But about 95% of them are just plain unprofessional and straight up disrespectful. They expect the way too much sometimes, YOU CAN'T EXPECT 6 PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO UNLOAD AND WORK 2 TRUCKS WORTH OF FREIGHT!!!!!!You could call ethics all you want, go to corporate, go to your market managers... NOTHING will happen. No one cares... not one bit... and it makes me really sad because I truly loved my roll at Walmart and I loved my department and my co-workers... But the management team just pushed me so much, I had to leave. It's not just what would happen to me that would make me angry, it's what I've seen with other employees, how I've seen them treat other people, and how I've heard them talk bad about their associates. Now with all that being said, I learned a lot at Walmart. I learned how to stack a pallet correctly, I would throw freight, bin freight, organize shelves, help customers, I would help back up cashier, I had to learn the HIPPA rules and regulations, I learned so much. The people you meet at Walmart are probably some of the best (or worst) people ever. Theres quarterly bonuses you can receive and if the bonuses are fairly good, Walmart will do something fun for the associates, for - more...",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service/Department Manager ,"Gardnerville, NV",9/26/18,2018,9,26

Non-family oriented,Loved the job and coworkers. A lot of headstrong managers that killed the morales of associates. A lot of favoritism and lack of being leaders. Takes one horrible manager to bring down a team and  that’s this store 2500 Tiffin Ave Findlay Ohio. Very self centered ego driven store manger that does not even acknowledge his associates. He is only there for the pay check and to rid the store of long time hard working associates and bring it part time people to fill their spots.,3,Former Employee,CSM Customer Service Manager ,"Findlay, OH",9/26/18,2018,9,26
Productive- never boring- ever changing,"A day at Walmart is ever changing. I learned and grown so much with the company,  Multitasking is a must. An associate can be anywhere from grocery online process to unloading a truck. My biggest challenge is succeeding in making the most disgruntled person smile. The workplace culture is customer based. Customer needs comes before the needs of the associates. The hardest part with working for Walmart is knowing that you have to schedule holiday plans around work and not on the holiday. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping and having the product for the consumer. Its for someone's birthday, anniversary, or Christmas present.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Silsbee, TX",9/26/18,2018,9,26

I was cornered in the office with Asset protection, a mix of 1 dept manager 3 asst managers and the manager of the store where I was told to recount how it happened. Within three words I was interrupted and told no it happened this way. I had to argue to get a word in to tell what happened. It was horrible, and I'm a strong person.

Horrible,"I worked there for 3 years, and only stayed because i had mouths to feed at home. Coworkers are always filled with drama and its every man for himself. One day you might have to work overtime to finish a mandatory project but they make you cut it at the end of the week so you do not get compensated for rearranging your schedule.

Good Learning Experience,"I learned a great many people skills working here; I always say, ""I had to let customers come to me angry, and make them leave LESS angry, to as great a degree as possible."" I worked the Customer Service counter. Many people come from the woodwork, so learning to deal with that type of person, without being unprofessional was, in my opinion, an ASSET to my character development. I firmly believe such an attitude is something that most people could use a dose of training to be a bit better poised; sadly, I find myself as one of few associates that even learned this type of diplomacy from there at all. I find that the disfunction in Wal-Mart, though LEGENDARY, is ironically the biggest thing in my history of jobs that taught me proper functionality. I am very pleased not to work there any more, though; they are BEYOND incompetent.

Extremely Poor Work Environment,Coming to Wal-Mart from the fast-paced and more liberal work environment of Sonic was a shock.

The Walmart experience is unique,"The job is doable, everything is laid nicely at the start. The first week was fine, as I was learning the basics and getting used to the routine at Fresh cap. But as I continued, they would change their policy almost every week, you were constantly learning how to do something in different ways. I don't know if they are trying to find the most effective way to do something by trial and error, but it was very stressful when you were constantly making mistakes. Also, they patience of the manager wears thing after the first week, they expect you to be on the ball regardless if none of the managers or supervisors are on the same page. Not a single positive reinforcement, just pure criticism. And don't think you will have help always, there were many days I was alone handling a 4 man job all day.

Working at Walmart,"Working for Walmart was quite an experience, to say the least. It was a typical stocking job - organize and separate the freight, place it on the shelves, and clean up when finished. It does not sound like a hard job until you factor in the unpredictable workloads and potential lack of adequate help - then it can become a bit much for some. It is hard job and not for everybody, but the benefits more than make up for the work required. Walmart offers great pay as well as amazing benefits and options for career advancement. I would say the hardest part of the job is working with the limited resources given at times to finish workloads that can be, at times, unreasonable. The best part of the job is working with people who can motivate you and keep your spirits high.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"DeRidder, LA",9/25/18,2018,9,25

Productive work in the Backroom,"On a typical day at work we would most likely finish what we started the previous day. We would have our weekly team meetings. I actually learned a lot of things, working at Walmart such as how most retails places are ran from behind the scene. Management was always good at the Walmart I worked for.

"productive, fast-paced work.","I started working at Walmart when I was a senior in high school, for my age and my schedule I can say that it was pretty flexible.

Fun place to work,"A day at Walmart can be stressful at times when its busy. Other days working overnight there is no customers and you can get your work done in a timely manner as long as you are productive. I learned at Walmart responsibility and respect for others in the workplace. Meaning that respect can go along way and that to take responsibility for your own actions is always the best. Management overnight was great. They were fair but stern. We always worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was when it was crunch time before the store opened. You had to have everything cleaned and up off the floor before the customers came into the store. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers. It made me feel good when I could answer their questions and help, them.",5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Fayetteville, NC 28306",9/24/18,2018,9,24

Unappreciative management with unrealistic expectations,"The management would give more tasks than could be preformed even being a highly productive worker. I enjoyed cake decorating but even when i was overbooked they would still take cake orders and expect me to stay late to make sure they were all completed. I was the primary decorator and would have to remake the majority of the cakes the secondary decorator made. It would take me 1/3 the time to decorate than the other decorator and we were still paid the same. While in the middle of one task they would have me stop to work on something else which would put the orders behind schedule. In the beginning the staff/management was very nice and helpful but after a few months the politics of favortism would set in and you could see who would not have to do as much work or get away with doing less and others would have to pick up there slack and were reprimanded when tasks were not complete. the work done was not appreciated and when a customer would leave compliments with management on an employees work, the compliment would not be relayed to the employee because ""they know they do a nice job already"". I feel a little praise can go a long way.",2,Former Employee,Cake Decorator/ Customer Service ,"Pflugerville, TX",9/24/18,2018,9,24
Used to be a great place to work,"I cannnot speak for all stores, but the one i worked for started out as a great place to work almost 14 years ago. The managenent team was great, we had true leaders who cared about the success of the store and its associates. Gradually it started to go down hill, a team is only as good as its leaders. The past few years I worked for the company were very trying. The core values that once made it a great place to work were almost nonexistent. The lack of respect and constant fear of retaliation made for a hostile work environment. There were only 2-3 managers you could go to unless you wanted your issues/concerns spread around the store. When I left the company our turnover rate was the highest it had ever been, and was directly linked to our management team. A little appreciation and recognition goes a long way and for some teams all that was pointed out was the bad and not recognizing the successes. I could go on and on but i will stop here. If you do decide to work for the company I hope that the store you work for has managers who lead with integrity and respect.",3,Former Employee,Fresh cap lead ,"Coos Bay, OR",9/24/18,2018,9,24
Policies as a weapon,"One Best Way is a weapon to make you go against your ethics. They play favorites, if you are different not a good fit for you. They have a attendance policy that has much to be desired. If you want to work there never get sick and never get injured. You have to get an outside company approval if you are sick more than three days. They are looking for submissive people. They don't care if you have a family.",1,Former Employee,Tire and Lube Technician ,"Scarborough, ME 04074",9/24/18,2018,9,24

Don't work here.,The hours are very inconsistent. Day shift one day night shift next. Other employees clearly do not like their jobs and are highly unfriendly.

Your average retail work environment,"A typical day at work requires you to be able to move a lot and meet the needs of customers.

Retail,Too many demand for quality work and not enough time or staff to meet the needs of the company or the needs of the customer.

A positive place to work when the right GM is in place.,There are good advancement opportunities as well as lots of new opportunities for education and tuition assistance.  The 3 and 4 day schedules allow you a good work/life balance with opportunity for overtime to supplement your income as a non salary associate..

Walmart was a cool place to work,A typical day consisted of checking in and going to the back to see what all had come in overnight. Then we would get the handheld computers for the daily inventory reports and to see what all needed to be checked. I learned how valuable taking count and keeping track of inventory was.

Depressing workplace,"Very difficult company to work for.  Management is for the most part rude and insensitive toward associates.

I learned at lot but most of the machines I kind of already knew how to use. The management was fine there was't really any tension between me or any other associates. The energy was fast paced but a little playful outside of the shop. The hardest part of my job was putting the super small objects onto the shelves.

I worked and had stable work for 6 years. Not complaining.,"A typical day of work would depend on the job or assignment you held. You know what you should expect, but like everywhere else you  might have to grind a little harder to help out the company when asked. I met many different people throughout my employment with both Sams and Wal Mart. I have learned to help others and be the best at my job. Management always accommodated associates, they work out schedule requests, employee time off . The kind of culture Wal Mart encompasses is to be helpful, nice , cooperative, and outgoing.

A mere paycheck in a dangerous to your sanity environment,"Put it this way, you will get stuck in your department. Only select people will have the chance to move into another department and even less are able to get promoted upwards. My store in Palm Bay, FL didn't encourage any advancement ever. Most employees were just pulled out of their departments to provide support to ICS and the registers up front because the salary managers felt zero obligation to the value of production by means of hiring and staffing those appropriate departments. Your own department would suffer as a result after spending hours elsewhere because it will be ill-advised to refuse management when they tell you to do something else other than the original job you were hired to do. The only reason I made it as long as I did was because I actually could forge friendships with my coworkers and I still do remain friends with a handful of them nearly 5 years later.",1,Former Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Palm Bay, FL",9/22/18,2018,9,22

Inconsistent in their policies.,As long as you are doing your job above expectations their point system regarding absences and tardiness can be modified. They pick and choose when the policy will actually be enforced. Exceptions are made to this policy for select employees.

Back up further and look at the store as a whole and you see more issues, so much in fighting, huge lack of communication, lack of direction and consistency. Then look at it as a corporation and it becomes soul crushing. Corporate does not care about it's people constantly a wolf in sheep's clothing telling how much better they are making things while sneaking benefits away to lower their costs. Corporate wastes money by the millions because it's out of touch with the teaching of Sam Walden it's customers, employees and reality.

Probably the worst frandchise that I know of,"During my two years with the company, we went through quite a number of managers for various reasons. It was always frustrating for me to be in that store and I always dreaded going in for my shifts. A typical day would involve CSMs playing favorites and removing people from their positions to cover another that is unfavorable so that that associate could be removed. There was hardly ever anyone covering the registers so there were always customer complaints to be fielded as I worked through the lines. At most, I want to say on a good day at peak hour we would have only approximately four tills open. The management was a joke in my opinion. They never responded to calls on time, and often ignored associate requests, and could often time be found socializing in the back office when sent to search for them.

Run Run Run,"As a department manager I was constantly moving which I did enjoy. Unfortunately, we were always understaffed with a huge workload causing high amounts of stress.

I loved my job and each and every position I worked and would still be there is I hadn't been laid off.

Unsafe work environment in and out of building. Employees arrive at work high (operate pallet jacks/forklifts) mgt fully aware, jokes that thier 'tired'. If you miss days, leave early, stand around and not work- while leaving the work to others, then this is the store for you. You will fit right in. If your adulting with responsibilities and bills : too stressfull, unsafe, disrespectful. Look to another store. strong work ethic is ignored and commented on as if there's something wrong in it/ with YOU. lack of communication with mgrs-which makes your job stressfull at best. daily, and often several times a shift,  the direction,job and duties will change from one mgr to another. There's a lot of rework, double work, and redoing job tasks for this reason and others: lack of structure, mgt not trained in job, lack of communication,etc. Most associates know more of job than mgt.

"Good hours, Horrible management",The hours and money are good. Management needs to communicate more effectively. Some of the managers through they were too good to talk to you or help you.

Walmart's hidden truth,"Walmart as a whole will be your best friend in public and say they will give you a good rate of pay and they will!

Great company and I love shopping there as well,4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Grand Blanc, MI",9/20/18,2018,9,20
Part time position,Always short staffed which means management will pull anyone to fill the sections that don't have anyone to work. People constantly call in and there are no repercussions. The employee is not aware of the department that they have been assigned to which does not make a happy experience for the customer.,3,Former Employee,Automotive Sales Associate ,"Portland, TX",9/20/18,2018,9,20
Its a Job,I have worked for Walmart at different locations. I was disappointed to see that they are all the same.

Its a Typical corporation.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Jacksonville, FL",9/20/18,2018,9,20

May I add, I was department manager over Stationary. I was literally going home and crying every night because I felt that I wasn't doing much and I even stayed sick a lot. The last straw was the last day that I worked, I was pulled for a coaching and everything they were ""coaching"" me for, I was telling them constantly and they ignored me all the way up until then and said I wasn't doing those things that I was telling them I was doing.

Idea of Walmart,A good day until the other shift doesn't do there job or finish what they started. Learned how to be responsible and have a positive attitude and how to think ahead. Management sometime doesn't know what they doing and they can be very disrespectful at times. The workplace culture is very laid back and relaxing. The hard part of the job is when you have a lot of tasks to complete at once. The enjoyable part is when you get off or pay day.,4,Current Employee,Stocker/Receiving Associate ,"Merrillville, IN",9/19/18,2018,9,19
"Good for you right out of high school, nothing else.",I work as a CAP 1 associate so therefore I work 4AM to 1PM which are great hours! The good things to celebrate end there however.

bad job culture,stressful environment strict adherence to rules not much leeway work flow was always the same feeling routine.  the job was dull. An employee would have not much chance for advancement without many obstacles,3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Coral Springs, FL",9/19/18,2018,9,19

Walmart gave me theoppurtunity to move forward with a career i enjoy.,5,Current Employee,Auto Technician ,"Las Vegas, NV",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Not their best for a lot of people but it worked for me till a new manager arrived,"The company is very positive and went through a lot of changes since their previous years, I loved the company till I had to deal with poor management when it comes to a required partner for my position, which I had to deal with a 2 person job by myself, taking all the blame and ending up with a manager that did not like me ""Wal-Mart is full of so many different type of people and unfortunately I ended up with a really bad one at the end"" overall I was forced to leave the company due to problems with management. I still think is a good place to work if you don't have to deal with that type of people that can turn the peaceful environment into something hostile.",4,Former Employee,Hourly Supervisor ,California,9/18/18,2018,9,18
Interesting typical work day,"Learn customer services, Cash handling, Stocking, Using  the handheld device to markdown, price merchandise, and learn others skills, Have the opportunity learn other skills.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Nashville, NC",9/18/18,2018,9,18
High Production Based,Overall It's a good job. As with every job it has its good days and bad. _x000D_A typical day for me Because i'm on the low end of the management team (supervisor) I come in an hour before the team to create assignments and plans for my team. I prepare the warehouse area of the building for unloading the trucks that come in. After the team arrives I give out the team assignments for my associates and send them on the task. Once that's done it just matter of checking on their progress as well as helping them when necessary. That's pretty much a day the life of a Walmart supervisor.,4,Current Employee,Cap 2 Supervisor ,"Athens, TN",9/18/18,2018,9,18
"Fun Place to work, very spontaneous and outgoing","Walmart was a blast, 2 years i spent was enjoyable. Alot of customers and stress but it was worth it in the longrun. Its a fun job if you like standing and helping customers all day like i did",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Columbia, SC",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Not bad,Not great not terrible. Not a lot of flexibility with schedule.Gained great management and merchandising experience. Did not like having to work overnights.,3,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Milan, TN",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Fast paced,Great job. It vary how you work if you'll stay. They are family oriented.  They don't mind helping you get where you need to be. I chose to work part time because I had a first job that I wasn't ready to let go,5,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Baton Rouge, LA",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Wal Mart,At my time of employment they were well known for being the largest employer of Americans on public aid.  But I hear that they are starting people out at a decent amount of money as of 2018,3,Former Employee,DEPARTMENT MANAGER ,"Herrin, IL",9/18/18,2018,9,18

I do enjoy working here,"There's a lot of great aspects about Walmart, but a lot of not so great ones as well. But that's any job. _x000D_Key things._x000D_1. new manager every few months_x000D_2. little ability to interact with management _x000D_3. often things you need to do the job are not made available which leads you to improvise. _x000D__x000D_good things._x000D_1. decent pay for what you're doing _x000D_2. 401k, pto, stock, bonuses, even for part time employees_x000D_3. extremely easy to advance, however assistant managers have no life outside of work, working 60+ hours at a minimum, and always on call, does not make you want to pursue a career into their position.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/Self Checkout Host ,"Clarence, NY",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Enjoyable experiences and interaction,It was a great starter job. I was in high school at the time and they were great working with my hours and very understanding! I would definitely go back it would just have to be at a bigger Walmart and not one of the small neighborhood Walmart’s.,4,Former Employee,Casher/Stocker ,"Rose Hill, KS",9/18/18,2018,9,18

Money.,"They cut hours like no tomorrow. Not a trustworthy job for money. One time, they changed my schedule the day before I was going into work, and they said ""they didnt cut any hours"". although my hours went down by 20.",3,Current Employee,Walmart Sales Associate ,"Alice, TX",9/18/18,2018,9,18
I hate 4th st. Walmart,Worst place to work for. Management WILL throw you under a bus for whatever reason they feel like doing. I really can't think of anything good to say about this store. It was really horrible and crooked.,1,Former Employee,IMS associate ,"Longview, TX",9/18/18,2018,9,18
need to hear out the employees,fast pace. Everything is micromanaged and timed to the second. never know how long your day will be. they can keep you there for up to 16 hours(happens often) and some of the guys i worked with live a hour away so they end up getting two or three hours of sleep and have to come back and do it again. this is very DANGEROUS! If they want to keep us there for that long on consecutive days they should offer a place to sleep.,2,Current Employee,orderfiller ,"Los Lunas, NM",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Bad.... Everything,"Management doesn't care. Coworkers don't care. Customers treat you horribly, and management offers no assistance. There is truly nothing positive to say about this company.",2,Former Employee,ELECTRONIC SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Duarte, CA",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Fast paced workplace.,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, with a lot of customers. Management does a good job, but negotiating hours can be difficult at times. The hardest part of the job can just be when the store is really packed but overall it was a nice place to work.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Oneonta, NY",9/18/18,2018,9,18
working at Walmart,"IT is alot of hard work, with no recognition for that hard work, the harder you work the more they want you to do, and its never enough. They don't care about the individual only about making money, their attendance policy is unfair to new hires, and is so strict so that they can keep using and firing people and not have to give them any benefits, there are people that have been there for many years and still are not made full time employees and have no insurance and no benefits. It's totally unfair employment practices.",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Brewton, AL 36426",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Nice benifits.,Walmart is a good place to work based on pay and benifits. They usually do not give you your days off together. Anymore it's a 4am-1pm shift or 2pm-11pm shift,5,Current Employee,Process Supervisor ,"New Martinsville, WV",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Very productive and great environment,Wish it wasnt favoritism there as well as needs to invest more in employee's. Definitely great company just lacks synergy there. Also very upfront about attendance as well as work pace.,5,Former Employee,Truck Unloader/Stocker ,"Layton, UT",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Workplace Culture,They typically want employers to show up and be on time. Attendance is a strict policy to adhere to and they take tardiness extremely serious. It is possibly one of the most diverse places to work for.,3,Former Employee,Cap Team 1 ,"Scotia, NY",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Stressful,Worked for Walmart for many years and it’s time to move on and find something different. Walmart is a very difficult place to work everyone is always so angry and frustrated.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Albuquerque, NM",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Very poor management,"Walmart puts itself out there as a company based on respect for the individual. This is not however how the company is ran (at least in my experience). Upper management has no problem with disciplining associates on the floor in front of others including customers. In my time there I was witness to others being brought to tears, including lower level management. _x000D_In the 4 years I worked for this company in this location I watched no less than a dozen assistant managers leave due to the abhorrent  working conditions under the current store manager. This is a very good indicator of the company itself as many complaints were filed up the ladder and  no issues were every addressed or resolved.",1,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Sault Ste. Marie, MI",9/18/18,2018,9,18
productive at all times,"A typical day at work is standing at the front either at the entrance or exit door. As a Customer Host you greet, provide great customer service, check receipts throughly, and check in all returns. Within the time I've worked at Walmart my communication skills have gotten better and I have learned that the hardest part of the job are the customers. As a customer host you will encounter a sufficient amount of confrontations, but you have to have self control and know how to deal with certain customers.  And let a manger or even security handle the situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to put a smile on a customer or the over way around after having a bad day and also spending time with co-workers, who become family after spending hours and hours with them.",3,Current Employee,customer host ,"Philadelphia, PA",9/18/18,2018,9,18
productive,I did not like walmart because the managers targeted me a lot. I also was cheated on a lot of hours and couldn't survive with what I was paid. over all I didn't like the place,1,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"San Angelo, TX",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Losing the interest due to the fickle organizational conditions.,Walmart is trying new things in the bakery and giving everyone but cake decorator. In five years working here I have lost more then gained while those after me have gotten more and advance faster due to a grade level discrepancy._x000D_Very unfair working conditions. But point out equality when they want to use it for their own advantage.,3,Current Employee,Cake Decorator/Baker ,"Moline, IL",9/18/18,2018,9,18
"Hard work, but pays well","As an overnight assistant manager, I would typically have to work at least 12-14 hour days, 4-5 days a week depending on the time of the year. The pay is good, but the work/life balance is really lacking and you often see people leave because of that. As a day ASM, you work a rotation that only includes one weekend off a month, and two full weekends of work, which leaves you hardly any time to see your family.",4,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Tennessee,9/18/18,2018,9,18
A good stepping stone,"It's a good place to learn how to do more advanced jobs, there is a lot that a sales associate does and it helped to develop a lot of good, useful skills.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Evans Mills, NY",9/18/18,2018,9,18

High Potential for Growth and Hourly wages/Fast Paced/ Paid Training/ Employee and family insurance,"Walmart has computer training as well as in store training. I was able to advance in my job as a stoker by simply communicating with my managers. I gained valuable experience working hands on to meet the consumers needs, practiced work place safety, timely placement and removal of holiday goods, expired goods, returned goods and damaged goods. I was trained to assist with store inventory control,  bar-code placement and removal, I trained with theft prevention manager to detect and properly address potential loss, I learned how to tally the total loss and sales percentages. It was a blast to hurry around the store working to bake then electronic goods helping to make the customer smile! It was a wonderful experience to be able to coordinate with mechanics, sales representatives and company vendors. I greatly enjoyed learning the history in Walmart the hours, breaks and lunch times are set so you are always careful not to start a job you cannot leave if your are soon to go on break or lunch.",5,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Vista, CA",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Productive and Steady,Walmart is a steady and busy company to work for and it offers a lot of things but it has its good days and bad it all depends on what time of the month it is.,3,Current Employee,Money Center Cashier ,"Harvey, LA",9/18/18,2018,9,18
Easy work when it is done right but lack of communication and the ability to prioritize can make the job a lot more stressful and harder to complete.,"Third shift was my favorite shift to work because of there being a better opportunity to work together as a team. Everyone helps each other out to complete all of the work and treats each other like family. The main issue/hardest part of the job is communication between members of management and their associates or constantly changing their minds on where people should be. There is a lot of opportunity to move up in the company but the issue with that is, they promote their “favorites” and not necessarily the associates that deserve it more and would be better assets. I’ve learned that no matter how honest and up front you are with them, it doesn’t mean they will be honest with you or take your concerns seriously.",3,Current Employee,Retail Associate ,"Jefferson, WI",9/18/18,2018,9,18

Definitely not bad paying but morale is low,"As a suggestion to anyone looking to seek employment with Wal-Mart, I advise being self-motivated and relaxed. Part of the problem I see from my experience comes from people having too open of availability and the system making their schedules hard to work with. If you take transit, I advise noting weekends off if it doesn't run to the location on such and finding the time ranges of when bus or trains run. _x000D__x000D_Their management is also hit it miss as to how good or bad they will be in handling problems or solving errors. _x000D__x000D_The managers do not make the schedule, the computer system they have does and it's pretty terrible. That's my biggest gripe with Wal-Mart. That and the reduction in positions as they attempt to condense sections and replace people with the self checkout stations.",4,Current Employee,Associate ,"Salt Lake City, UT",9/18/18,2018,9,18

review,Overall did not enjoy my time with Walmart. Enjoyed working with fellow employees and custoimers but management would promise things and not deliver. Very inconsistent and paranoid being critical on smallest items yet seeming totally oblivious to the big picture of their employees and their needs.,3,Former Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,"Springfield, MO",9/18/18,2018,9,18

slow and fast paced at times,Overall great place to work. Management was okay but not very strict. I loved my job here and what I did but the management was poor in my opinion.

The work environment  is also stressful because of this._x000D__x000D_Wal-Mart does not give you sick days, and you must get authorization from a contracted Company to be excused, this requiring a doctors certification which is a time consuming process that can be denied.

Okay,Walmart is a good place to work if you're a kid in high school just trying to make some money but for those trying to pay bills and life a stable life it is a no. The hours are very inconstant. If  you apply for a cashier potion you are automatically considered part time so you RARELY see 40 hrs a week. At most you will receive 20-32 hours.

"Good company, unfortunate coworkers","Walmart can be ideal if you like to work fast paced. However, I prefer attention to detail, such as thoroughly cleaning burnt-on bits in a rotisserie. It's also unfortunate that they got rid of the chemical which would easily bake off such grime, and left us instead with grease lift in order to save a bit of money. You have to use grease lift when the oven is hot, and a lot of elbow grease. Moreover, they do not provide adequate tools in most cases to remove the built-on grime. Also, it is very disheartening to be one of the only ones willing to put in the time and effort required to remove it, and then not be appreciated for it because it's taking too long and other employees don't want to help customers. It makes it much less productive in both to continue having to stop, wash your hands of chemicals, dry your hands, put on gloves that inevitably you have to fight since your hands are still damp, and assist a customer who may likely be shooting glares at you by then. I would say that's partly why I left: lack of appreciation and support in maintaining a clean work environment.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lindon, UT",9/17/18,2018,9,17
Overload,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was stressful and long. The customers were not the problem, it's the employees.

The job you do and what you put up with working there is worth the pay when you realize everywhere you go is going to have similiar issues.,"I was surprised to find out walmart actually gives you raises not just talks about them. The quarterly bonuses are near impossible to get so dont count on them. Super long rediculous security lines to go thru for breaks, lunch, or end of shift. Walmart ECommerce actually attempts to keep a good workplace culture in a variety of ways, trying to make their employees feel good and stay positive. gives food, has costume competitions, talent contests, etc. Not long enough breaks for the hours put in. I was working a 12 hour shift but did reports so would come early and stay later and only allowed 2 breaks during entire shift and no lunch. the breaks were i think 1 at 15 minutes and the other at 20 minutes. rediculous. i couldnt imagine if i were one of the workers standing, atleast i was in an office. I would recommend walmart however because the pay and the raises at the ECommerce, definitely not speaking for a store, only the ECommerce i worked at in Plainfield IN. If you are looking for the type of work that a fulfillment center offers, then atleast with walmart they attempt to think about employees some compared to other fulfillment centers. They try to have enough microwaves, bathrooms, lockers, even plastic ware for your food, ive seen places so cheap that they wouldnt even get enough microwaves or chairs didnt even care. the worse thing about walmart to me would be the breaks.",4,Former Employee,Traffic Clerk ,"Plainfield, IN",9/16/18,2018,9,16

They trust me to help them navigate the tough situations they encounter in their transactions and are relieved when the situations are handled correctly, the first time.  Management appreciates when we can do our part and stay on top of the issues.  The hardest part is saying no to a customer.  Sometimes, we can't do what the customer wants and that makes the customer angry or very upset.  This is when management steps in.  The managers I work with are very good with our customers and try very hard to resolve every issue to meet corporate policy and customer satisfaction.

"It's as bad as you imagined, or worse","Are you ready to work somewhere where the company will literally hire anyone? Walmart cares about having associates in view, and not much else.

The other half of the employees are good workers who do twice the work they should have to just to pull the dead weight of the first half._x000D_The store was a perpetually-sinking ship. Departments stole equipment from each other because there was never enough to go around. The handheld devices that let us prices things went missing all the time.

Then they will never schedule you time to do the training, telling you to work it out with your supervisor during your normal hours. Your supervisor has 3 employees instead of the 6 they should have, so they can never spare you to go do the computer training. If you complain to HR about not having the time to do the training, they say ""oh, we will discipline your supervisor"" and then you can expect retaliation. The end result is you either don't get your raise because you did not complete the training, or you alienate your supervisor because you got them blamed for something that's not their fault in order to get time to do the training._x000D_The very first - more...",1,Former Employee,Baker ,"Winder, GA",9/16/18,2018,9,16

self governing laid back job,"A typical day at work consisted of me coming in after the overnight crew and gathering the products of theirs left on the floor. These products either could not fit, are on an incap display around the store, or we just happen to not have that specific item in our upc database.  I would do is gather all materials and decide which category to bin these items in. after I binned the remaining items in, I was to go back on the floor and scan all of the shelf openings(shelves with out of stock items) and report back to find all of those materials. I would do this Hr in and Hr out. A self governing job that required my own judgement in order to fulfill what was needed",4,Former Employee,Help Desk Support ,"Murphy, TX",9/15/18,2018,9,15

If You're Not Higher Up In The System... Good Luck!,"I worked at Walmart for a year and 2 months. I just graduated high school and attended college after work. I applied to work in electronics because that is an area I know I could excel in but instead they called and offered me a position in CAP 1 (grocery stocker) which is a 4AM - 1PM shift. I took the position because I needed the cash and because I was also told that they would get me where I want when it was available. I was the youngest to work during the shift and they treated me as if I had a low work ethic when I did just as much, if not more as the next person. Time went on and positions for where I wanted opened up but I was always denied without reason. The biggest kick in the face was when they hired my brother (who also applied for a different position) and gave him the spot I wanted. I was stuck working in a position I didn't want to be in an unhappy. My depression went up and satisfaction went down. I kept working hard even when I didn't want to because I hoped they would notice it. I told management countless times about how i felt and it always seems like it went in one ear and out the other. My fellow colleagues wanted me to work with them in certain positions because they knew I was good at it. They would even request that I move over and management still did nothing. Anywho, if you're desperate for money, work here. Also, they had me working two positions, which is okay however, the other position got paid $0.50 more and they refused to give me the raise because it was not my job title. They do not care about the little guy. As long as you are helping the - more...",3,Former Employee,CAP 1 ,"Newcastle, OK",9/15/18,2018,9,15
Terrible company,"Terrible place to work, sure u get a 10% discount but on very little stuff, no discount on groceries at all. All they care about is the bottom line and making money any way they can. Sure things r cheaper there than most places but that's because they treat there employees like animales and make money from others misfortunes and mistakes as well as ripping people off. I've never seen so many lies and deception in a company, pathetic, go to amazon",1,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Representative ,"Kingsport, TN",9/15/18,2018,9,15

Worst company ever,"I worked at 4 different stores in CA over an 8 year period and each was the same. You have 5 levels of management, none of whom are on the same page, telling you to do something different. I can't tell you how many times I did a single task 3 times 3 different ways because the higher level wanted it done differently. Zero employee appreciation. They make the employee earn anything that should be given in appreciation. Low wages, and they went to an annual percentage raise, so if you are new and making 9 an hour and doing a fantastic job, you get 5%, yeah $0.45. But if you're a lazy worker who's been there for 10 years and makes 15 an hour, you get 3%, yeah $0.45. That is neither encouraging good work nor fair. Wal-Mart is a greedy, disgusting company and a horrible place to work.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Bakersfield, CA",9/15/18,2018,9,15
Not a good company,"Store leadership sets the tone for each individual store. Management needs to buy into your programs.

Walmart does not appreciate their workers,Walmart shows a lot of favoritism if you’re not in good with the managers they done respect you they make you work harder than what you’re getting paid for and they don’t appreciate the work that you do most of the managers don’t know how to talk to or treat regular  associates they talk down on them as if they’re better i would never recommend anyone to work for Walmart unless you’re considering remodeling,1,Current Employee,Remodeler ,"West Palm Beach, FL",9/15/18,2018,9,15

I had to remain calm to help the customer as possible if things didn’t get solved in the that matter of time I will have to call a manager or a supervisor.  Things I did around store was to stock my items in the correct order and I was a cart man .

Over-all not bad,My typical day at work was not bad. It could have been better with management not making it seem like they were punishing you every time you were sick or had to take time off because you were sick or had to go to the hospital.

I used to love working for walmart but walmart does not share the family/work lifestyle they expect management to have a work/work lifestyle,Walmart overall is a excellent place to work. But it's hard to have a family life and be in management especially if you have children. Because your children do not understand why you spend all of your time with your job and not with them.,3,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Georgia,9/14/18,2018,9,14
A truly terrible place to work,"I am what they call a flex associate at my store. This means i do other peoples job every day. Instead of hiring 10-20 more people they are now starting to stretch everybody as thin as possible instead of getting more help. Like most others have said, terrible managers they don't care they just need it done without any hint of care. The atmosphere is dreadful no windows,lights that dim and get bright at will. A floor made of the flattest and crudest concrete known to man that will make you flat footed in mere months. The pay is ok if you live at home and just need money but if you have a family and you're thinking about it don't bother. Some jobs there are much better than others as i have done almost all of them. Cap 2 which is essentially the store slaves unload trucks then put the stuff on the shelves I would non jokingly let prisoners out on work release to do this job its that bad. I'm not going to explain every job that would take many more pages. The turnover rate is probably a person a day. Try to make walmart a last resort even though they will probably be the first company to give a call back. And if you do end up there figure out who your friends are and who is a walmart fanatic and will follow every rule and report the dumbest things instead of just taking care of them and avoid them. Find the little things that kill time or mwke your job easier and more fun.

It was mine!",1,Former Employee,Produce Clerk/Stocker ,"Anaheim, CA",9/14/18,2018,9,14
Not worth the stress,"The management team and lack of follow through are the worst parts of working here. The company does not care about their associates at all. Managers will ask you to stay over your scheduled time one day and then tell you that you have to cut the time the next day. You are not supposed to have to work off the clock but salaried managers will interrupt your lunches/breaks and time off constantly. _x000D_Policies are not consistently applied to all employees. There are different rules for different people. Schedules are changed at a moments notice and with no warning. One of the companies tenants is respect for the individual but management does not know the meaning of the word respect.

Walmart is the worst place to work!,Overall my work experience with Walmart was awful. I was the training coordinator so I saw the management aspect and the employee aspect. Managers will work you to death and take all the credit but fire you in a heartbeat if it suits them! I was fired because I was accused of breaking policy. But I collected unemployment for 16 months.

Being a Customer Service Manager,"I arrive at Walmart. Take a quick summary of how the front is running where breaks are for cashiers customer service money center. I then begin to run the gambit of trying to find who can cover what break. I run around crazy and have to stop what I am doing for every approval needed on a return or a complaint about the lines from customers. Or anything else they want to complain about. Then you have managers above you screaming about this or that that needs to be handled. Is it all bad no. I love my customers who are kind considerate and understanding. There are a few good Managers in every store. If you are able there is friendships and compadres but be warned they will through you under the bus to save their own skin. Walmart is a dog eat dog world where only those who are favorites will move up. You are never thanked. (except by customers.) Dont expect any hand holding in any position you take there is none they throw you to the wolves._x000D_I have learned a lot though working here. How to have a stiff back bone. How to realize people get upset and dont always mean to say things the way they do. I have also learned people will lie to you to get what they want accomplished.

its ok,its ok. would recommend to stay hourly. being a salaried manager can be stressful and its hard on home life.  if u decide to be a manager be choosy about the store u go to.  stores in lower income areas and diverse areas are way harder to manage and deal with.  a store is a reflection of the community it is in.  you hire from the community so being in lower income areas that deal with lazier people can make work life much more stressful than it has to be.,3,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Antioch, TN",9/14/18,2018,9,14

Working at walmart,"Walmart is a decent place to work if you are someone that doesn't go to school or have a job and you need to support yourself. However, I would not recommend this job to a teenager or college student. Walmart literally does not care about your school hours at all and will make you work 8 hours a day on school days. The managers only care about making money and not their employees. One of my former co workers requested a couple days off work in advance because his wife was delivering a baby and the Walmart managers wouldn't let him get the day. Like really? You want him to miss his daughter being born? He ended up quitting anyway because he wasn't missing his child's birth They don't care about anything at all that isn't related to Walmart. I asked multiple times for my hours to be cut because it was becoming difficult for me to be a fulltime student and handle 35-40 hours of working at Walmart and they eventually let me go and honestly, I wasn't upset about it.",3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Gulfport, MS",9/14/18,2018,9,14

And then there's that one girl that just sits in her seat looking at videos drooling with a 103 degree fever. The best part of the job was they didn't mind if I licked the windows as long as I wore my helmet. Management was great as long as you stuck your nose as far as you could up their butt and wear that poo stain on your nose like a champ the rest of the business day. The dress code here is very laid back. Have you ever seen the ""People of Walmart"" videos? What they don't tell you is that it is their employees. And the smells. Oh, the glorious smells. The hardest part of the job was having to use the restroom around lunch..... if you need to you better hold it and pray the urge dissipates or grab a clothespin for your nose and your bottle of Lysol.

work here only if desperate!,"If you are out of any other choices, this is the place for you! They will tell you that you don't work hard enough, fast enough, you aren't good enough, stuff like that constantly. Great benefits that cost you half your check if you have to cover more than just yourself. Overtime is VERY HIGHLY discouraged and you will be sent home before you get that close. Can't change shifts to one that works with family life no matter what the company says. The store managers will do everything in their power to keep you from going to another store that might be closer to where you live unless you change states. Raises are only if the company advertises that they are giving everyone a raise to a certain amount. Time off is earned based on how many hours you work and it is all the same whether it is sick time or vacation time. If you have health problems you'd better make sure that you have a very friendly doctor who doesn't mind filing out paperwork for each and every little thing to pass on to the company that handles FMLA / short term disability / and everything else on behalf of Walmart.  When you tell them that you can not work certain days of the week due to appointments, they'll schedule you on those days just so they can fire you for no call no show.",1,Former Employee,STOCKING / TRUCK UNLOADING / CUSTOMER SERVICE ,"Norman, OK",9/12/18,2018,9,12

Great Team!,"I loved all of my co workers and pharmacists (except pharm manager.) We had a blast everyday. I learned so many things in only 6 months. They pay for certification, licences and renewal of your license. Discount card is given after 90 days for roughly 10% off general merchandise (great for xmas.) _x000D__x000D_Pharmacy manager, however, told me if I did bring my input score up, I would be fired. It had to be 95% and mine was 94.4. If they do not like you, they will find a way to get rid of you. With a better manager, it would have been a dream job! Pharmacy cashier is what I started out as making $9/hr and 1 month later was offered a tech job. They reimburse you for license which was $103. You have to be certified after 1 year of employment. They offer training for the test if you are ever allowed time to use it. Computer learning is only available at Wal-Mart. Once a tech, my pay increased to $12.50. You get another raise once certified. 1 hour is given for lunch and you receive two 15 min breaks, for which you get paid for.

Friendly Customer Service,"Depending on the day, you would be either extremely busy or waiting around. You will end up doing work that was already done or you will be doing so much,  that you will be late for breaks, lunch and even leaving work. Management needs work. Such as better communication with employees, care and teamwork. This would greatly improve the attitudes of employees and in return, the customers experience. _x000D_However, besides the management, the hardest part of the job is working self-checkout on a busy day because you will be alone to watch 8 machines and all the customers that come through (to ensure nobody steals and everyone is helped) along with having to also call for the associate(s) working the jewelry department, who are never to be found by customers. _x000D_It is not inherently hard, just small tedious hiccups that can be improved with better communication, training, and teamwork. _x000D_All-in-all, I found the enjoyment to be in fixing the machines and helping employees and customers.

overall good place to work,"A typical day at Walmart was doing your assigned tasks or job and always helping customers when needed.

Most of my managers knew what they were talking about and knew how to get the job done, and had great interpersonal and management skills. The hardest part of the job was the daily stresses of trying to live up to everyones expectations, but at times it was also the most enjoyable. During a typical day every one of my coworkers knew me well for always being all over the store, whether i was taking an item to a front register for a customer, mixing paint, selling hunting licenses, finding particular items, and more.

Walmart loves to write employees up and fighting a write up you do not deserve is next to impossible. They preach about safety and leaving the way you came but set up unrealistic volume goals and are constantly shortening the time they give you for trips. Management at this location simply looks at employees as a number. Had an incident a few weeks ago that I spoke with the GM about. She clearly was uninterested and not listening. She was not sincere at all and when she told me her “solution” she repeated the problem I spoke with her about back to me completely incorrect. Clearly she was uninterested.

While working at Walmart I learned that management can be very useful when dealing with upset customers and can be helpful when things are speeding up pretty quickly.

Never could find someone when I needed help. Coworkers were angry all the time and ganged up on those they didn't like. Hour lunch break at 3am was TERRIBLE. No where to go but McDonalds and no one in the break room was friendly with one another. Got ""talked to"" once for missing a 15 minute break due to some strange customers asking me to scoop out 10 different pet fish for them at 1am, when I never scooped fish before.

Unrealistic expectations.,Working at Walmart wasn't too bad at times. A majority of the time they set unrealistic goals and expect them to be completed by the end of your shift.

Working for walmart,When I worked for walmart it was horrible. When I worked overtime I did not get paid.

Walmart only cares about the bottom line.,"After eight years of loyal service I was fired when they no longer required my services due to a reorganization of the the store when a new store in Kissemee took a major share of busness in the area. This unfortunately is typical of how Walmart treats its employees. Our schedules were cut, we were forced to work in different departments and no one was sure about the future. Management was .unable to reassure us because all decisions were made by corporate headquarters. Many employees were forced to find other jobs because Walmart could no longer give them full-time work. The best part of the job was my fellow co-workers. I made a number of friends there and I shall miss them.",1,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Clermont, FL",9/10/18,2018,9,10

walmart is unfair and plays favorites.,"walmart gives  new hires three abseces, regardless of doctors or hospital notes. It gives them three in six months. After probationary period it is nine in six months, regardless if you have a doctors note or hospital note. They have a notice posted near the time clock that if you are sick, come to work anyway, clock in and talk to your manager. If the manager (who is not a doctor) doesn't believe you are sick, you have to stay. Nevermind if you have a sick child._x000D_They will ask you to stay later and then tell you that there is no overtime and you have to cut it.

Fast-Paced Work that requires motivation,"Walmart is a very dynamic workplace where there is always something to keep you on your feet. The work can be pretty grueling, but can be fairly easy if your teammates are as willing to finish the job as you are. You must be able to rely on other people as well as being able to be reliable yourself. Some parts of the job do require heavy lifting, but the work is spread out enough to avoid fatigue. Hourly associates are given 15 minute breaks every two hours with an hour lunch in between.",4,Current Employee,Inventory Associate ,"Cypress, TX",9/10/18,2018,9,10
Simple work and a positive environment,"The labor performed at Walmart is minimal in order to keep associates at top-performance on the floor and in back-stock.

A Fun Work Place/Environment,"The Walmart I worked at is considered a Super Center because it ranked the busiest store in the region. From sun up to sun down it always stayed busy, even at night it was busier than most Walmarts. A typical day at work for me, when I got to the Garden Center the manager on duty would set me up on a register. In-between checking customers out at the register, I'd be helping put overstock/freight away. This is what I did until someone else came in to relieve me on the register. When that happened, I'd take my first 15-minute break. When I came back, I was the backup person for the register, meaning if there were 3 or more customers standing in line then I would get on the other register to help get our line down and get the customers out the door. If customers bought mulch/potting soil/etc I would go out to load it into their vehicle. At any given time, if we didn't have anything to do, we were to grab a broom and start sweeping. I also helped outside with the plants, whatever they needed me to do I would do, such as watering, rearranging the flowers positions, and etc. I helped with the setting up of planograms as well. Depending on your scheduled hours for that day is what they went by to obtain how long you get for lunch break. Meaning if your scheduled 5 hours of work you don't get a lunch, 6 to 7 hours would give you a 30-minute lunch break, and any time scheduled past 7 hours, you'd get 1 hour for lunch. Then after lunch was over we'd come back to relieve someone so they could go to lunch. I really enjoyed working in the garden center because I love plants and working - more...",4,Former Employee,Customer Service/Sales Garden Center ,"Mooresville, NC",9/10/18,2018,9,10

Somewhat decent environment,It’s a decent place to work however the management is terrible when it comes to scheduling hours.

Horrible,You are treated like you are expendable no matter how hard you work and how much pride you put into your job. It's all about the bottom dollar and cutting costs instead of raising morale and quality of work. NO ENCOURAGEMENT AT ALL,1,Current Employee,Baker ,"Stuart, FL",9/9/18,2018,9,9

Walmart is a good place to work,I like helping the customers when they come into walmart needing helping finding certain items. Overnight stocker hours would be 10pm-7am.

"Fun, Fast Paced Job","Once you got into the swing of things, stocking was a really great job. The first week will be hard unless you have a great manager willing to work with you- I did not, and had to figure things out on my own. How smoothly your shift goes will depend on how well the 2nd shift did their job (unloading trucks and moving the freight to the floor, some times working some of it out as well) and if your team members are hard workers. Pay is above average for this area, we got to listen to headphones/music while we worked and got off at the same time every night. Hour lunch was nice. Overall a rewarding job and a great work out.",4,Former Employee,Overnight GM Stocker ,"Temple, TX",9/9/18,2018,9,9
Walmart: A Great Place To Start,"First up, this is not a review to gin up the pro Walmart base, rather an honest analysis of a good company. If you want to learn ""real"" retail and how to apply customer service, Walmart is the place. The opportunities exist to learn nearly every aspect of retail, if you work hard and show interest, Walmart will give you an opportunity to learn....Having said that, expect to work weekends and YES, holidays (except Christmas Day) why? because that is when customers shop the most and somebody has to mind the store..So if weekends and holidays aren't your thing, then your chances of getting hired are slim (not impossible but slim)  Rules are implemented because of sheer volume of customers and it can get intense, especially on Black Friday (day after Thanksgiving) _x000D__x000D_In conclusion, Walmart will give you an opportunity to learn, the opportunity to grow and to secure your future..It will not be easy each time you clock in, rather some days will be quite hard and seem endless. Take the challenges and run with it, if it isn't for you, no harm in trying but for my money, Walmart will give you a chance to shine.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"AZ, Utah.",9/9/18,2018,9,9

The atmosphere is very much what one makes it, if you want your day to be fun it's up to the attitude you come to work with. Many of the customer are very friendly especially if they know you have done all you could do to make their visit to your store the best one possible.  Walmart allows you to take ownership for the department in you work and make it all that it can be. The reason is what you do reflects who you are as a person and an associate.  As an associate we have the ability to own stack in the company which is part of the reason that you take pride in what you do at Walmart.

I worked for walmart with the intent of retiring but this wasnt the fact.,I was laid off by force after being coached for something I did not do and was forced from my position. Walmart is not a company that chooses its management by what a person knows  but chooses management from the buddy buddy system. (Its not what you know. Its who you know.). The store manager  during my time as Co manager would not teach me as I requested several times to promote. The 40 hr week that all managers are told is a lie. Every day as a salaried management I was expected and told 16 to 17hr days everyday. So I do not recommend this place to anyone. Unless you like a throw of the dice living.,1,Former Employee,Co Manager ,"Hurst, TX",9/8/18,2018,9,8

Going downhill fast.,"Recently quit, but I was a very long-term, full-time employee.  I've worked at several locations in the south.  Some stores had everything right and I would recommend 10/10 for working at, but about 85% of them are run very poorly, and care more about profit than employees. _x000D__x000D_ For me personally, a typical day would be working from clock in to clock out to have scheduled orders ready, as well as keeping my area fully stocked, inventoried (front and freezer), making back stock, and then playing catch up to make up for the lack of work that others in my position weren't doing.  Management was fully aware of the imbalance of workload, but still chose to push all fault on me when nothing was done on my days off.  Working over 12 hours on a Saturday was a common happening, as well as not being able to take lunch until around hour 8.  _x000D__x000D_Employees in other sections of the department when not working would spend time sitting on tables/pallets/carts either talking to each other or face-timing.  They were told multiple times to stop by lower levels of management, but were never disciplined aside from being scolded verbally._x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job was knowing that I was working towards creating the best experience possible for our customers, while most other employees acted like it was an absolute nightmare to work.  The most enjoyable part would have been the customers.  I absolutely adore the look on faces when they saw what I had created for them.

Managment,"Managment makes or breaks a job. I have worked with two different Walmart's over my career path. I was absolutely spoiled with the first. The management was amazing we had a few bumps in the road every once in a while but that's normal. The job wasn't easy but not having that added stress of poor management made work life enjoyable. However when I moved states and started working at this different Walmart, work life became intolerable. Managment is very poor, has lots of favorites, exploits the associates that aren't their favorites and pits everyone against each other. It has been extremely miserable for the last almost two years. Basically it's a 50/50 chance if you will be blessed with amazing management or stuck in a bad situation.",2,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper/Grocery To Go ,"Brighton, CO",9/8/18,2018,9,8

"Fast paced work flow, average pay, they match your $ for $ on 401K.",I like working for Walmart. It is constantly changing. That is retail though. But the employees are nice and helpful. The management is on top of their changing of cultures and everyday living for everyone. Walmart has good insurance but a little expensive. The pay is not that good takes so long to get a raise.

Management was horrible,"walmart as a whole wasn't terrible, just a couple of my immediate support members. They constantly made horrible comments about how I'd ""show up late"" even though I was doing returns, helping customers, and even doing price changes.

My work review,Typical day a Walmart you come in and walk the floor to make sure it looks good. Fix any issues if needed. Then I would verify all the merchandise that comes off the truck the night before. After that I will go to the front to the cash office and pick up my register tills. I will assign tasks to the associates that I have coming in for the day. The next day I verify if the task were done. I walk the floor again to make sure the merchandise is going in the correct spot. I do price changes weekly. Also do modular resets every week. Its fast paced but time management at the same time.I have learned to help customers the best I can. To grow in my position to the best of my ability. The hardest part is not having the associates needed to get things done sometimes. The most enjoyable is knowing that I do a lot to get everything accomplished.,5,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Boynton Beach, FL",9/8/18,2018,9,8

Yes they give raises but then they cut their hours and lock scheduling off where long term associates cant have a life outside of work then they lock into a schedule that doesn't even fit their needs.

The customers and Coworkers make or break your day,"I've worked with Wal Mart for quite some time. I worked a few different departments officially and close to 10-15 departments unofficially. So when I say customers and your coworkers make or break your day, they really do. The job itself, no matter where you're located, is relatively mind numbing work that isn't usually difficult. The real fun of the job falls on who you interact with. Most days you will have a fantastic day with nice people who come to chat or ask for help. Other days you're running around like a monkey trying to help and you may not be rewarded with pleasant company if you can't complete miracles i.e. not having X thing in stock, which is the only thing Y person came to your store for.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Columbia, MO",9/8/18,2018,9,8

Tough skin needed.,"Working for walmart taught me two things, one people will treat you like trash and two look at your schedule consistently it changes every day.

Good for the inexperienced and the beginners,"WalMart is a tale of two stories. You have the older employee that, really, maybe not have other options for work; and the baby employee, freshly entering the job scene. -- Just my opinion; Walmart is a place where you work when you: as an older adult, have no where else to go; or if you have no other work experience. But for those, high school kids or recently graduating from high school, or young adults working through school; this is a fair opportunity. For everyone in-between, if your not in management, or plan on making something of yourself, it's really not a booster of careers.

They NEVER hire purely full time in my experience. They may have raised their pay, but slack off in many other areas. _x000D_As an unloader and inventory specialist, the job is very physically demanding. I enjoy working with my hands but the rough hours and overnights made me very fatigued. Coworkers are generally fine, supervisors can be hard to work with sometimes because the system is so rigid (so even if you and your supervisor agreed to something like changing hours, it may not pass ""the system""). This is pretty standard for working for big corporations though._x000D__x000D_I would recommend Wal-Mart to people who just want a job and aren't particularly concerned with benefits or what hours they work. _x000D__x000D_Also a pro or con depending on your politics, but Wal-Mart is very strongly anti-union and each time I've worked for them I've had to sit through 5 or 6 anti-union videos.",2,Former Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"San Antonio, TX",9/7/18,2018,9,7

All of my managers are absolutely incredible and are super heroes. The daily plight of working in one of the largest retail stores to ever exist is exhilarating, frustrating, and physically demanding, but I walk out of those doors everyday and feel great about what I accomplished.

It really depends on the store you work in.,"I started as a cashier, It was fun talking to the customers. I received praise for quick and accurate check out but also in how I handled occasional issues, wrapped and bagged fragile items. I kept things neat. A few months later I was moved to Customer Service. this involved knowing the returns procedure and what was and was not acceptable (although we did have a Manager that would okay ANY kind of return because she hated conflict). Then I became a Department Manager for Ladies Accessories which was 5 tiny departments rolled into one. That was nice. I had a good crew under me and I treated them fairly. I taught the new people how to do product displays, use the TelZon price gun (its a hand held computer now), If you are a hard worker, and you have a good store with a good manager, you can do very well. _x000D_But dont get hurt on the job. Workers Compensation (at least here in NJ ) stinks!!!!! One friend injured her neck and back when a box fell off the risers in the back room and landed on her.

Fun and Productive Workplace,"I start work at 10:00 pm and my shift ends at 7:00 am. We start with a brief ""huddle"" in one of the break rooms. Generally, the Frozen/Dairy delivery is already in their appropriate backrooms. First, before stocking, I like to briefly check through the yogurts and pull out-of-date and expired products. I get a Pallet Jack and a couple Table and L Carts and work the pallets and bring back the overstock which the ICS bin as much as they can; occasionally I binned it myself. Then I check the milk and eggs and pull expired and damaged products and then quickly check inside the backroom for out of date milk, rarely it happens. Then I stock milk and eggs by the closest expiration date. When that's done, I try to reorganize the backroom to make space and make it neater. If I'm done early, then the next thing is to help other departments until 5:30 when everyone else brings back their OVerstock, get rid of garbage (empty boxes) and ""zone"" the departments and isles from 6 am to 7 amThe management was fair and the co-workers were great fun people and it was awesome working together. The hardest part was working WEdnesday nights which were the biggest delivery each week and re-organizing the backroom. The most enjoyable part was working with other associates.

Productive,Working for Walmart Central Fill has been a very positive experience as well as a very negative experience. I enjoyed learning about how to run the parata machines which fills customer's medication. I was very excited to learn how the conveyor belt and the automation machines work to get the medication out in a timely matter. The negative thing I can say is that Central Fill don't keep the technician notified on the new meds or the new laws yhay have been put in place. I was on the inventory team and they don't have the necessary tools to get the job done in a timely matter.,3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Houston, TX",9/6/18,2018,9,6

Upper Management Incompetent/Disrespectful towards Hourlies,"Most salary managers do not put any effort into connecting with their hourly associates and instead expect them to do anything and everything they ask of them no matter what the cost with no overtime of course. I learned that this work environment is deceptive, gossip ridden, cut throat, and toxic. Discrimination/Harassment/Racism are rampant and if you report these issues it will be you who is singled out and even with proof it is overlooked._x000D__x000D_ If you stand out as an individual, you will get stepped on to try to keep you in your place. If you push back with valid points and it goes against upper management, expect retaliation in some manner especially if you inadvertently make them ""look bad"" to visitors with your new ideas. The hourlies are great people and are just like any other business where they make personal sacrifices so that they can provide for their families. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job is finding a happy medium of trying to balance your work/life and be a good leader to these people who are already down trodden thanks to previous and current upper management._x000D__x000D_Merchandising is competitive and fun and working closely with your vendors can really give you an edge over other stores and your local competition.

Prepare to see your position phased out by automated-everything.,"Experiences vary widely from location to location, but for the most part, what we've come to view as the Walmart employee stereotype, became the example of unmotivated misery for a reason. Walmart employs a LOT of wonderful people, and I do feel they've been unfairly singled out for their low-wages, and unethical behavior...they are, by no means the only corporation to adopt this as the standard. In fact, the pay and benefits found in equivalent positions with other retailers tend to be slightly better. That being said, the Walmart ""culture"" of anti-union, policies regarding coaching for improvement (being written up), and the average store-level associate seeing their annual pay increase by just forty cents (often less)...there's plenty of demotivation to go around. We are seeing a surge in the number of self-check-outs, and a push for both mobile app, and online purchase options to keep driving corporate profits, while streamlining overhead costs associated with the number of positions not rendered obsolete by automation. Associates are seeing positions eliminated company-wide, and the workload being redistributed (often unrealistically) to a crew already sparsely staffed. Burnout is rampant. Walmart's ""open door"" policy is what they offer as their alternative to unionizing available to any associate seeking a way to advocate for themselves in a confidential, fair, and open manner, without any fear of retribution, or unfair treatment.

Walmart was a great place to work,"My coworkers were amazing, they made it easy for me to go to work everyday. The customers weren't always so bad either.

Was a very stressful and unprofessional work enviroment.,"I learnt from Wal-Mart is to never trust what managers said. Every time something happened to me health-wise, they wouldn't care and would bash me for it. The management was all over the place and most of the time, I couldn't find them when I needed them. The workplace culture was fine however. The hardest part about my job was that they said I was their best worker but yelled at me when someone else didn't do their job. The most enjoyable part of it though was seeing the happy faces of customers when I was able to help them find the product they were looking for",2,Former Employee,Seasonal Sales Associate ,"Middletown, DE",9/5/18,2018,9,5

It was a typical day at work,"It was a typical day at work where you work hard, supported one another, and got closer to your fellow associates. The hardest part was adjusting to new polices that were initiated because when the ones that don't work are introduced it slows down productivity and makes things harder for associates, but the experience of seeing new and various customers was a good one.

I hope that all walmarts are like mine because honestly its been my favorite job so far. They give you a probation period of 90 days but after that 90 days, you get a raise, a storewide discount card, and you start accruing PTO that you can either use or cash in at the end of the year for. They have a great open-door policy with all the managers so you never have to feel bad about bringing up an issue. It's a great place to work.",4,Current Employee,Fresh Cap Associate ,"Tacoma, WA",9/5/18,2018,9,5
laid back and busy workplace,"A typical day at work required a lot of heavy lifting and it was sometimes difficult to get the help I needed. In the beginning my management was very open and understanding, but over time they became more distant and harder to get to. It was a very negative space to work in, but there were a few positives including the store manager who was very nice, and the fact that there was not really uniform made me feel comfortable while I worked.

When I called for other associates to come and help nobody would come and customers lines were backed up into the isles and customers got mad and management blame you for it. No level of communication among supervisors/management to improve these working conditions to come up with a game plan to solve the issues. Also work among CSM's were not equal some were sent out to collect carts when we were low on cart people or had a call off and others plain refused and wanted to send me out instead it pushed me to leave.

Once I settled into a good routine I realized I had probably one of the least stressful positions there. Very little changes in routine, lessening actual challenges. Still, it takes a great deal of tolerance to stay for as long as I have. You really have to be a full-time associate to qualify for any benefits.

When I started the company,  reading Sam Walton's book was part of our training and I believed in the company, but now 6 years later I am staring to realize the company's culture has gone down the hill. People they put in place to develop and mentor their associates are more concerned about their personal agenda and retaliation and the home office in Bentonville seem to ignore, abandon or marginalize great workers. !2 years ago I believed in the company, now looking back I was either too naive or the company's moral compass is non existent these days.",3,Former Employee,Assistant manager ,"Miami, FL",9/5/18,2018,9,5

If you are someone who likes sticking to one set of tasks and doing the same thing over and over each and every day, then you would find a nice peace working at a place like Walmart.

run do not walk away from this distribution center,Management is aweful.  micromanage everyone 24/7.  I worked there 12 years and every year it only got worse. I was always having to watch my back even when I wasn't there.  There was always someone in management that was constantly going over my work to find something wrong.  I even had managers screw up my work and take pictures and tell me that was the way they found it.  It is always your fault not management when things go wrong.

I have six hours of my shift by myself, and I cover two register areas as well as having to deal with incomplete freight, bin scans, outs scans, orders, audits, etc. It is a weekly event to be berated by management for not being done on time when we do not have the personnel to complete the task in a reasonable manner.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,Not Applicable,9/5/18,2018,9,5

A College Job Where Your GPA Suffers,"The shifts are hard to fit in with your college courses and the management nudges you to take your allotted hour meal to go to a course you need to take to graduate. The company claims to be helpful to those who are wanting to further their education, but they push you to take night classes at part time college status so their schedules do not take a hit. Salaried management also seems inadequate to make decisions and are rarely seen or heard from during your entire shift, which is actually 9 hours for a full shift. Little is also done from home office when you have an issue with the salaried management and try to get out of any responsibility, even when the issue is able to be reviewed through the security cameras and multiple people come to your defense.

Pharmacy was ok compared to the company as a whole.,"I was being pushed out from the start until an amazing pharmacy manager took me in. He has helped me get my license and helped me be a better person. It was going well until I lost my insurance due to me becoming 26 years old. I worked so hard to get full time only to get told they couldn't work with me. They hired two new techs, told me that they had no more hours and couldn't work with me.

Clear favorites,"You can be a fine employee with excellent customer service, but management plays favorites constantly, leaving undervalued employees feeling even more unappreciated. Under-staffing leads to confrontations with customers. Incompetency leads to confrontations with supervisors.

Excellent Intro =/= Good job,"Walmart is a company that is very easy to get into when applying. The stores are easy to get your foot in the door, especially if you're looking for a low tier job, such as a Cashier. They promise things such as improvement and personal growth while working there, but all of it is just pretty lackluster. The work environment is draining, with someone always complaining about what you/your department does wrong. A lot of miscommunication is apparent in management and it trickles down, affecting the associates as well. Managers will slack off in their own office, I've seen one sleeping in there before, and they break their own store rules, such as dress code and phone rules. I've seen constant abuse of power, with managers trying to control or take their frustration out on other associates, myself included. They do offer an open door policy to report them, but in the end, it doesn't get rid of the issues. Walmart is an excellent first job, but when you feel as though you need to move on, do it.",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"South Milwaukee, WI",9/4/18,2018,9,4
A poor place to work,I worked at Wal-Mart for over a year and while it paid the bills my experience had been poor.

Working in my own department  has been a pain, as I’m too often pulled to work in another area (due to a blatant lack of staffing),  for which I often have little to no formal training.

It's better to be lazy in Walmart because you're more likely to get a promotion. If you disagree with the store manager, she will make your life terrible. She'll throw extra work on you, give you bad evaluations so you dont get a raise, treat you like scum.

great job for those who do not have to many outside activies or a busy family.,a typical day at work consists of doing your regular duties around of inconsistent redirectives and management changes.  You come in and not always work where you are assigned.  In the middle of a project you are call away to help in a different area be cause of  an absent employee.  Managers and supervisors still demand the work that you are expected to do gets done.   This is done with out doing any overtime.      Most managers may help but usually there is not enough employees to the work and lessor managers end up work 2-3 hours overtime.  _x000D_Most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and meeting their needs.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Bloomington, MN",9/4/18,2018,9,4

"This was a company I enjoyed working for, until the atmosphere of the company changed against the veterans employees of the company.","company turned against the vertan employees who are the backbone of each stores operations.  They bring in new management crews whose jobs seemingly is to eliminate the jobs of experienced and professional employees, in order to make way for new employees of limited or no experience, and also with no chance of gaining benefit packages unlike that of the veteran employees who have well over a decade or more of service to the company.  In fact, in many locations senior management is very hostile towards those who are able to carry the loads of several junior employees.

Long hours, expected to stay from 5 or 6am to late into evening, you stay till picks are done. Then you are expected to cut overtime instead of being paid for it. Some schedules you will work 7 or 8 days in a row. Know your rights as an employee as management will try to tell you otherwise how things are done.

Not A Bad Place To Work If You Can Overlook Some Things,"Working for the company really has 2 things that determine your experience, and that is your Store Managers and Assistant Managers. There are corporate things that are beyond their control that can drive you nuts, but if you are in a store where the management works hard and treats you with respect it can be an enjoyable place to work. I worked in a couple stores and there were some that had low morale and it usually came from the top down and on the other end there were stores where you actually feel appreciated and like its a big family. If you have a manger that treats you like you are easy to replace then it's harder. If you have a manger who appreciates the work you put in and it shows it can be a really good place. There is plenty of advancement in the company if you do the right things and stay on the good side of management and after some years put in you can make a decent living, but if you plan on just being a regular associate it will be a long time before you make good money if ever.",4,Former Employee,Grocery Associate ,"Farmington, ME 04938",9/1/18,2018,9,1

"Great place to work, lots of kind people","I would come in with a positive attitude and always set a goal to bring in as many carts as possible. Most days would be tough but my managers always motivated me and it got done. The  hardest part about the job was either staying cool during the summer and staying warm during the winter.

"Pays a decent starting wage, and always ready to hire.","Walmart can be challenging if you are a single parent.

Unexpected and good experience.,Socializing with associates. Management can improve the morale in the stores instead of focusing on the numbers.

You never know what you're gonna see in Walmart.,"I've helped all KINDS of people there. A lot of time spent talking people into spending their life savings on a television. I've had to spend many shifts just getting prepaid phones turned on for senior citizens. Sometime's it was stressful when customers have no idea what they want. But overall, it's a great place to work until you have to help push buggies in the parking lot. And even that's okay in the Winter.",5,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Texarkana, TX",9/1/18,2018,9,1

Your always busy because there's always something that needs to be done.,5,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Hamilton, NJ 08619",9/1/18,2018,9,1
Stressed Out!,The management was very grumpy/rude. I don't think that it helped to make my co-workers any happier either. Most of them walked around the store looking so disgruntled. No communication whatsoever.  After working a few 35 - 40 hour weeks I let them know I can't work more than 24 hrs and still they kept scheduling me for 35+. No store organization. Things on the shelf just didn't make sense. No wonder people can'take find things.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Freehold, NJ",9/1/18,2018,9,1
Good steping stone,Walmart is good for those in between jobs or for students wanting to get a job during spring break. _x000D__x000D_students get a glimpse of what the work force is like and people in between jobs get a satisfactory pay till get back on there feet.,4,Former Employee,Associate ,"Abilene, TX",9/1/18,2018,9,1
Very quick-paced and stressful,"I work as a Fresh Cap 1 & 2 Associate. I used to love Wal-Mart and all the people, but recently it has changed for the worse. There is no encouragement/praise for anything good you do; all you hear about your performance or the performance of your dept is the negative. It wears on you after awhile. There are unrealistic expectations of our abilities- we are expected to cull (find bad product & dispose of it) 4 depts in 20 min or less. They do not accept doctor’s notes as reasons for having missed work and they are not flexible when it comes to absences.",3,Current Employee,Fresh Cap Associate ,"Stillwater, OK",9/1/18,2018,9,1
Great place to work,The hardest part of my job is having enough hours in the day to get everything accomplished. The best part of my job is making a difference with my staff and customers.,5,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Hilliard, OH",9/1/18,2018,9,1
Over worked,Run the other way. Stress level is through the roof. Management continually puts out little fires instead of putting out the fire that’s causing the little fires. You will work hard and management expects even more from you. My store was not staffed the way it should be. You will feel like you need to be in 4 different places at the same time. Please do yourself a favor and don’t apply.,1,Former Employee,Anonymous ,Anonymous,9/1/18,2018,9,1

customer service,"I enjoyed working for Walmart because it taught me a lot about customer service and I enjoyed the people and the customers.

Treat salaried managers like they’re not real people,No work/life balance. You’re expected to do more and more with less and less by working everyone to death. Salaried employees are treated poorly and expected to be available at a moment’s notice. Home office constantly changing direction so you can never be “on process”.,2,Current Employee,Co-Manager ,"Gun Barrel City, TX",8/31/18,2018,8,31

it was work,"I spent three years there and never got promoted even with trying. I was expected to do more than my fair share of work on any given day. There was not a lot of respect from some of the management, if you had a personal problem you where told to figure it out or get fired. If you where sick you were still expected to show up for work. I was told that although i was running a fever of 103 i was still required to show up yo work my shift.",2,Former Employee,Lawn and Garden Sales Associate ,"Knoxville, TN",8/31/18,2018,8,31

Great learning environment with exiciting daily operational duties,There were always different daily duties given to me that helped me learn different things about the department that I was working in.

Its really fun,co workers were really easy to get along with. Managers understood stuff happens so they would cut you clack or work around your schedule. the only down sides are sometimes the managers are too relaxed and nothing gets done. Then the other downside is you don't get paid any extra for working holidays so it makes it hard to go in those days. Over all its a fun place you just have to be able to handle doing some stuff yourself that's not in your job description.,4,Former Employee,Associate ,"Excelsior Springs, MO",8/31/18,2018,8,31

Unfortunately, I had minor surgery and they saw how much I did and they could not wait for my return,  after my leave of absence return I was surprised my job had been given to 5 other people. I had to step down to customer service and the offered to join a new program to help start it from the ground up.  It prospered with many new clients added daily but the unrealistic expectations for us went from 40 picks an hour to over 120 and I decided to career change and use my degree and stop volunteering.  My managers did not have a say they were pressured too. I loved and dedicated almost 12 years to the Walmart world my co-workers and customers were awesome I loved it but the hard work without enough people is too much for everyone.",4,Former Employee,Manager ,"North Richland Hills, TX",8/31/18,2018,8,31

Better than most companies today,"I worked graveshift case lot order fill. Very hard work. The work area was dangerous with lots of bending under racks to lift heavy boxes. The job quotas were ridiculous and you were required to use a special productivity scanner each time you performed a task. It was supposed to allow a 'reasonable' amount of time to perform the task, but, what it expected you to do was unrealistic and obviously the people who developed the software had never done that job. Unless you are a robot or superman, it was nearly impossible to meet their goals. Also, they don't believe in team lifts for items weighing over 70 pounds so a lot of people hurt their backs or got hernias etc. The management operates under the walmart brainwashing policy which is  nothing more than socialism (all the workers give all to the company etc. ) The hardest part of the job was the physical labor involved. The most enjoyable was when I was tasked with label control which didn't require repetitive lifting and was a lot of computer inventory control. I would still be working there if they would have allowed me to do that job full time, but, they expected me to essentially order fill and then do a full days work in inventory control so they burned me out and I left the company.",3,Former Employee,case lot order fill and label control specialist ,"Sanger, TX",8/31/18,2018,8,31

Fair place to work,"Upon clocking in I would head over to my register that I was stationed at, followed by counting the till to verify it was $100. I would then start taking customers to check out the items they had gathered up in the store.

Walmart Benefits/Pay/Management,"My experience was good, but it's not a career I would want to stay at. Everyone is different. For me I just use this place for the income I need to pay some bills. The insurance is great the benefits are great. The matching of the Roth Ira is great. Also, the 401k match is great. Just the pay would be higher would be nice to get. I think if you need a job right away go apply for Walmart. You need to be ready for working at Walmart. They changed the dress code. You use to not be able to wear jeans now you can. They use to only be able to wear only Blue or white shirts. They now allow you to wear any dark color to work as long as its work appropriate. You do have to wear a vest you get when you join the Walmart team. They give you a box cutter and also access to the online part of the company. If you need things to talk to the management and ask for it. They will listen, sometimes they don't act when you ask them for something important. The hardest things to do at Walmart is to make sure you are ready for some hard tasks. They ask you to do stuff that is sometimes out of this world, but you just have to do it. Make sure that you are not a slacker. You are on a points system about your attendance.

no good at all,"There are quite a few issues associated with being under the wing of the parent corporation instead of a totally separate Foundation.

Productivity of the Workplace at Walmart,"i worked the graveyard shift so idk what the typical day at work would be cause i only worked a month there. and i learned that i had to be fast paced and that i need to stock the shelfs before the end of the night. the hardest part of that career was that i didnt have the right type of comfort ware to be the fast pace employee that they want me to be, but the enjoyable part of that job was the company of the other walmart employees and conversating with them.",3,Former Employee,Night Stocker ,"Moses Lake, WA",8/30/18,2018,8,30
just don't,"If you don't have to work at Walmart, don't. The advancement is slow, the training is inadequate, the demands are unreasonable, and the health insurance will leave you bankrupt. I'm not someone who was fired and is now disgruntled. I worked there for a short time as a break from my chosen profession. I have an advanced degree but found the back office position to be difficult because no one would train me properly. I asked for training repeatedly. It was given to me after over a year. All of a sudden everything about my job made sense. It was too late, however, and I stepped down. I worked several positions there. Sometimes you get lucky and have a good manager above you, but the hours will be awful, you'll be penalized for taking off time for legitimate reasons, and although the stock options and contributing 401K was great, the health insurance was the minimum the law allowed and left me bankrupt after an ER visit.

A place full of experience good and bad.,Walmart can be both the best and worst place to work at the same time. Being as though it is a very well known retail facility you get a vast majority of different type of customers. Management also plays a big role into how your work environment will be. My advice before applying there would be to either know someone currently working in the store you seek to apply to so that you can get a feel of management. Also to walk through the store during the hours you wish to apply to get a sense of the place. If you are someone who gets stressed out easily this is not the job for you.,4,Current Employee,Customer service and cashier work ,"Somerdale, NJ 08083",8/30/18,2018,8,30

The pay is not great for the amount of work you are expected to do but at least most of us get 40 hours a week. There is opportunity for advancement.

"Disorganized environment, but enjoyable co-workers.","The size of most Wal-Marts causes problems with the work environment. With how many departments there are, communication is hard. Managers would rarely communicate successfully between each other. If you are a newer part-time employee, you will usually be thrown back and forth between departments by managers to do menial jobs or cashier. I can't count how many times I was called over the intercom to do this or that within my first few months. Managers are extremely competitive at Wal-Mart, and will do anything it takes for their own area/department to be well maintained, even if that means causing problems or short-staffing the department you were hired for, which in the end just causes stress for more people. Customers are either very polite or entirely look down on you just for being a Wal-Mart associate. You also get very strange customers who do very strange things at times, which honestly adds to the fun.

The hardest part of my job is not have merchandise on hand when customers come in to make a purchase because we are out of stock or the merchandise didn't come in.

A big workplace with difficult customers.,"I feel that Walmart has begun prioritizing profit for the company over their employees. They are emphasizing self-check machines over cashiers and their new automatic scheduling system usually ends with giving employees less hours than better ones. Most stores now are large and constantly changing, and the customers do not always make life easy on you. Most stores are trying their best to adjust to newer changes in their management requirements, but this does not always work out.",2,Current Employee,Service Desk Associate ,Pennsylvania,8/29/18,2018,8,29

Management,Management needs to listen to their associates. I mean if u show the associates that you care. Police that they have in place hurts more than help.

"Fun workplace, always moving people around","I liked working there, but the management definitely plays favorites.

Instead of advertising for applications a select few were given a code to apply with. Other than that I enjoyed working there.",3,Former Employee,Warehouse Worker/Forklift Operator ,"Spokane, WA",8/29/18,2018,8,29

Holidays are fun to work cause you get to see all the new stuff but the people aren’t always fun!,4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Roanoke, VA",8/29/18,2018,8,29
I enjoy working with my hands,"I enjoy working with my hands so getting to change oil and tires on vehicles was fun for me. The problems come in when they hire kids that have no common sense and, unless they have full under bays and not ""zip-pits"" like mine did, you can't train them the way it should be done so as to not cause damage to the vehicle or pull the wrong filter. _x000D_   They lose a substantial amount of money through the automotive department and I tried to implement a solution to this but too many managers from other departments want to try to micro manage back there and say, ""You can't do that."" so everything would go back to the way it was and hours would get cut and us blamed for theft and shrinkage. _x000D_   I did enjoy learning more about vehicles in the way that I was unfamiliar with. I still could not tell you info if you asked me but I would know how to look it up for you and suggest an alternate idea or even an upgrade.",4,Former Employee,Lube and Tire Technician ,"San Angelo, TX",8/29/18,2018,8,29

"works to meet your schedule needs, fair callout system, quarterly bonuses","Overall the benefits are pretty good with Walmart. They start you out at $11 an hour, there are quarterly bonuses (with the potential to go up to $550), you are allowed to work what time you want to, and the callout system is very lenient._x000D_The issues are the management. There are rules, called the One Best Way, and you are told to follow these rules, but then constantly are criticized for following these rules, simply because certain management do not like them. Certain areas do not receive proper coverage, which upsets customers. Certain things, like cleaning for example, are not a priority unless a higher up manager is coming to walk the stores, we all get pushed way to hard but are not allowed overtime, and I could go on.",3,Current Employee,Food Department Manager ,"Palmyra, ME",8/29/18,2018,8,29

I learned a lot about fabrics and electronics.The management there was not so great. I could never get my main issues resolved through them. The personalities in that place is something to recon with. Some of the teammates have outgoing personalities and on the other hand, some were biased and had terrible attitudes. Being the person that I am, I knew how to deal with the personalities and attitude in a good way. I also learned that, if I'd go in, do my job, speak and greet customers, be nice and kind, and stay to myself, Id have a great day on the job.

Some managers never took the blame for something and made sure higher up managers knew it was the associates.

Good starter job,"Inconsistent work plans, hours, duties.  Never defined answers from management when the deli manager was away and a management only decision was needed. Long periods of time would pass before broken machines, stoves, fryers, equipment would be fixed. Would work overtime or a double shift because a lot of employees would call off work a lot.  The most enjoyable part of that job was meeting customers and helping them.  I feel I provided a wealth of information to the customers and would pass along the knowledge I would gain by researching the food items I prepared and sold.  I was acknowledged by management on several occasions for my outstanding customer service and was awarded pins for my uniform.  I also appreciated every one of the outstanding reviews on the Walmart website for my outstanding service.",1,Former Employee,Deli Associate/Head Baker ,"Pinellas Park, FL",8/28/18,2018,8,28

The crew was cool but the management was inconsiderate.,"There wasn't really a typical workday. You didn't know what you were doing until you got there. It did teach me that sometimes to get the task done you have to put your own spin on how your doing your work. No one method works with everybody. It also taught me that although you need to get the job done quickly, speed and safety don't go hand and hand. You'll always be lowering priority on one to do the other better. As far as a workplace goes it wasn't all bad. The most enjoyable part of the day was that we were all the same when it came to associates in the same position. Our mindset was the same and our sense of humor was the same. Even our supervisor was a joker like the rest of us. The reason I rated job culture so low is because of the management. They are fully aware that the hours for aisles are a lot of the time wrong, but still expect it done by that time. They will tell you to go home for being sick, and then point you the next day. The worst thing about them is that they'll set standards and then immediately make it impossible. For example, we're suppose to have 8 people working the truck at any given moment. We had 6 that day. They want the truck unloaded in an hour and a half. Within 30 minutes of working the truck, two of us get taken off the truck to pull carts outside. Then one of us has an anxiety attack and goes home. They still expected it done in an hour and a half.",3,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"East Liverpool, OH",8/28/18,2018,8,28

To accomplish the goal for the day, you run your area as lean as possible to meet CPH Goals.  We have a staffing meeting, a quality meeting and housekeeping meeting (walk the building with brooms and dustpans) daily.  As far as the culture goes, the three basic beliefs are still in tact along with integrity being the foundation.

It was not an easy task and the constant changes in the retail world was sometimes hard to master one thing when the next one had already started. A good place to work if you're ambitious enough and have the time to give. This isn't a 9-5 job and can't expect to leave on time every day, if any day. Unlike most reviews the employees are hardworking and very thoughtful, how they interact is soley based off the management in the store. I unfortunately was affected by the restructuring and still to this day am unsure after all the blood, sweat and tears I put into the company why I was let go. Instead of staying with the company and stepping down I decided to venture out because it became more reality that the way the company is headed there really isn't going to be a safe position within the company in a few years. This is to be said about most retailers as technology is rapidly growing and requiring less people to run the stores. I will never bad mouth the company as they did so much for me through my career and my personal life, but I can't say that about some of the managers I worked under.",3,Former Employee,Store Co Manager ,"Naples, FL",8/27/18,2018,8,27

Safety and management,"Working at Walmart was going to be a temporary job. But I got in I liked it and my Coworkers, and thought career. But when my safety and the safety of my coworkers was not a priority for management I began to think differently. Being left alone in the shop, used oil filters on racks falling into staff eyes, equipment not bolted down resulting in serious injury to a coworker, tire work being done while alone in the shop, and customers roaming around in the shop, just to name a few. Favoratism to management relatives, no consequences for bad behavior and management telling you to quit whining and do your darn job is very unprofessional, but it happens and in front of customers.",2,Current Employee,Automotive Technician ,"West Chester, OH",8/27/18,2018,8,27

Sometimes, if its slow, they'll have you do other little tasks like stock nearby shelves, or help the managers with a display. _x000D_During this job I learned a lot of patience and customer service skills that are pretty valuable. My management was good--which is not always the case. I've heard horror stories, but probably every workplace has its good and bad bosses. _x000D_The workplace culture is kinda hokey. I never really got into the pep-rally-style cheers and the other goofy stuff. But the people are generally nice and reasonable as long as you show up on time and do your job. _x000D_The hardest part of the job was when customer needs/wants conflicted with corporate/managerial needs/wants. Customers would get mad when they didn't get their way, and managers would get upset if you didn't magically know how to strike the perfect balance between following the company rules and pleasing the customer (I swear what they wanted me to do was different every time). _x000D_The most enjoyable part of the job was helping nice customers.

Pays good but managers dont work with each other,"It is a good job don't get me wrong. It is fairly easy for the most part, but one manager would tell you something and another would tell you something else. The pay is great, but the main reason I looked for other careers is lack of time with the family. The DC closes one day a year and that is Christmas and you have to have PTO time to cover it for you don't get paid. The last Thanksgiving we was in there for 14 hours.

The department manager might require you to set modulars depending on the time of the week or do price changes. Any overstock freight has to be taken to the back and binned appropriately. I've worked in three stores now and honestly the workplace culture depends on the store and the individuals hired. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers, some people are trying their best to make you miserable or scam you and steal. At the same time, the most rewarding part of the job can be the customers... some of them are genuinely delightful people that can make you smile just thinking about them days later.",3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Summerville, SC",8/27/18,2018,8,27

"Productive, Fun, And Flexible",Working for Walmart was the best. I enjoyed the managers and the help and advice that they gave to me and the co-workers did everything in their power to help you succeed at your job that way the company wouldn't relieve you of your duties.

Not a Good Place to Work,Management does not care if you possibly have a really bad health condition and you are not supposed to work.

They work people too hard and there isn't enough workers,"The grocery department only has 7 people that actually work in the aisles.

I'm usually one of the only grocery associates that's there out of seven others stocking shelves, helping customers and running around the store.  One of the hardest things is tolerating what managers say or ask you to do because a lot of times it doesn't make sense.I'm thankful and grateful for the job but its getting to be too much and they're always telling you things you already know how to do.

The hardest part of the job would be is the physical aspect of unloading a trailer. A typical trailer piece count in a high volume store such as the one i worked at is around 2,400 boxes of freight.

Management does not fulfill their promise of salary adjustment for Certified Pharmacy Technicians,"Overall there's a good work culture, but management can be very deceiving.

I was hired as certified pharmacy technician from day 1, but that never happened.  When I raised this concern during one of our meetings, after 3 weeks I was instead displaced and given the option to work in the front register of the grocery department (outside the pharmacy) for 2 months and then they will decide whether or not to keep me.

still better than compettitors,Walmart is changing overall. They used to have the highest tech to pharmacist ratios and were generous with pharmacist hours. Now they are following other stores models. They are cutting hours and staff as well as benefits. They aren't hiring at anything more than 72 hours and rumors say soon the max will be 64 per pay period. I worry about my hours being cut and as a single parent still paying student loans I can't live off any less than the 64 hours I'm at now.

"Good for new hires, not so much for older","In the past few years, this company has gone though a few changes. The most obvious is the higher pay rate a few years back bumping new hires to 9 dollars then 10 the next year (roughly). If you had been there before hand you too were just bumped up to new hire rate. Then, last year, the base rate went to 11. The process was the same. Walmart also nixed a true holiday pay and instead moved to PTO (paid time off). You accrued hour of PTO by how long you were there and how much time you worked. PTO could then be applied to your vacation, sick, or holiday pay. When I worked there, I earned 1 hr of PTO for every 11 hours worked (I worked there 6 years, for 40hrs a week). This process worked for me and those that worked longer.

Stressful,"Most of my co-workers are wonderful and lovely people. However, the store atmosphere from corporate all the way down to local management is highly negative, and undercutting. So many associates have confided in me that they are disillusioned, frustrated, even angry and distrustful of the management and the new way of day-to-day operating. Unfortunately I understand what they mean. We have an incredible amount of new managers and many of the highest levels of store management continue to be people right out of college. They have never actually worked this field and have no life/people experience to draw from for this job. Also there have been SO MANY changes and restructuring since start of the this fiscal year. This has taken many people's jobs away so that everyone lives in fear of losing their jobs on any given day.",2,Current Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Knoxville, TN",8/23/18,2018,8,23
Overwhelmingly busy days with a lack of management and employees,"I took this job purely because I needed some money quick and I knew they’d hire me on. At first, I didn’t mind working there. But then it seemed as if they were calling me in on my “off” days because they didn’t have the people they needed. When trying to talk to management about it, they set up an appointment to talk later. When I showed up at that time, my manager had already called it a day and was gone. After multiple tries, I eventually said “enough was enough”.",3,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Littleton, CO",8/23/18,2018,8,23

Walmart Technology,"The recent push on the technology front at Wal-mart is a great start for the company, but it still has a long way to go.

Here it is at the end of August and Walmart has already started sucking the life out of me.  No one smiles, If you're lucky you MIGHT get a grunt out of someone when you say good morning, the associates are annoyed when a customer asks for assistance.  Management doesn't follow the Walmart's 'one best way' so that things are consistent through out the store.

A friendly and employees first company. Except a few issues,"For the most part they're a very employee happiness driven company. They come equipped with decent starting wages, an extensive benefits package after 6 months. As well as if everyone does their jobs and avoids injury whenever possible? Worthwhile quarterly bonuses. The only issues I had while employed there that were of a concerning level were either; Managerial based when a manager doesn't like you for personal reasons? 90% of the time they'll freeze you out of their sections and make getting promoted difficult. There's also a severe lack of communication that prevents A LOT of necessary information from reaching higher ups. In a timely manner, or even at all.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Merchandiser ,"Lubbock, TX",8/23/18,2018,8,23
It's Walmart,"It's been a very long time since I last worked at Walmart. This was back when the starting pay was $7.70.

Good place of work bad management.,Walmart is a good place full of diversity and culture. But hard work does not pay off. There is no room for career advancement and bonuses.

Amazing coworkers,They change around management too often it is hard to get a routine.   I had 3 different assistant managers within a matter of months.  The last manager was never present..I saw him 2 times over a month. This was during a very back to school busy time. It was frustrating and definitely makes you feel like the company could care less. Upper management was very unorganized. The company would have guidelines  for you to follow and submit plans but higher ups would toss your plans out and say they were just required for corporate.  It would result in chaos and stress.,3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"New Castle, IN",8/23/18,2018,8,23

Stressful and Sporadic.,"In my experience at Wal-Mart, management was always watching you. They would come walking around every 5 minutes to check to make sure you were still working. They'd throw you in 3-4 departments because the store was always understaffed, they'd give unrealistic time constraints on when you should be done with a given task, they over work you and don't care.

Frustrating and stressful,"I don't credit the company with my promotion to department manager. I was groomed by one manager who liked me and it took 5 or 6 years to get to that level. Management plays favorites and if you lose a manager that likes you you're kind of screwed. There are never enough cashiers (anyone who shops there will tell you this) but anyone who isn't a cashier can and will be pulled from their area to the front to cashier for as long as front-end management sees fit, regardless of whether or not customers need assistance in that area or other work needs to be finished.

Unnecessary Stress,This company tries to work people to death. There’s just barely enough workers to maintain facility half the size.

Poor place to work,"You are expected to do the workload of 2-3 employees I do not recommend working here at all unless you like being a workhorse and feeling like you're getting nowhere.

The opportunity for growth is there but you must be willing to work hard and prove that you are an asset to the company.  I have had great luck in working with amazing associates and managers but I will say that there are bad seeds at any company.  With Walmart, I was able to travel the country and provide a nice lifestyle for my family.  When hurricanes destroyed the south, Walmart allowed me to go help those in need just by asking.  The hours were very long and I actually gave up attempting to see friends and family during any holiday but it was a small sacrifice.

New store with a good outlook and overall flexible pace,"I worked for this Walmart for a very brief time however I had a chance to do several contacts with personnel which helped me to have some take on the overall culture of that store. I believe in general Walmart has a good organization and also a very strong sale leadership. As for this store it was close to my place and also brand new which was exciting for me to begin working in there. Upon a few days of work I realized that some things were unfair and unbalanced. The training was completely off and there were several managers in there. We had access to computers to work on our training which was one part of the process and they were good at that, however, the follow up was nonexistent unless somebody had a problem which happened with many new employees resulting in some customers being openly critical about their frustration. We were also moved from all of our positions at their own liking at any time which happened often and there were a lot of camaraderie to some and not to others to accommodate certain favoritism fostering a lot of selfish behavior and toxic competition. This is a note to the credit of the store involving customer service... Even tough this atmosphere was lacking good team work, I also believe that I have never encountered any other Walmart with so many customers feeling entitled to complain openly and bitterly about the services they were being offered. It is unbeknownst to me the origin of this criteria of behavior...Some positive to this leadership was the fact  that they had our schedules ready and ahead of time regularly and the admission process was - more...",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Plano, TX",8/21/18,2018,8,21

In California they are strict on the no overtime rule as pharmacists are considered non-exempt hourly employees.  Market Directors seem to change between 2-3 years, in which those higher up decide to redraw district lines and change the other stores that are considered part of your market.

I am thankful for the training I have received, but only in the sense that it gave me experience to find better employment. Wal-Mart is the very essence of a toxic work culture. Management is vindictive and gives favoritism to pet employees while honest, hard working individuals are worked to the bone, treated unfairly, and tossed aside and fired on tiny little infractions. It is a very suffocating environment to work in, uncertain whether or not you're going to have a job every day.
