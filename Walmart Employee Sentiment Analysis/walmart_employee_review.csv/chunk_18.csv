Not recommended at all,"Being a customer and being an employee at Walmart are 2 completely different views. Being a customer, you see a steady-working convenient company. As an employee, it was h*ll.

Great co-workers,"The best thing that I can say about Walmart was the co-workers. They are like another family. You want to work hard with them because if you don't you feel like you've let everyone else down. The managers can be nice as well, but the pay and removeal of annual raises due to minimum wage going up shows a great deal of not being loyal to the employee. I worked there for 5 years, and every time minimum wage went up, my annual raise was erased. In the end I was making 20 cents more then the person who got hired tomorrow (Mind you, minimum wage is set to go up again soon so that 20 cent difference would have been erased), and I had been there for 5 years.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Vista, CA",12/19/18,2018,12,19

"Good pay, disrespectful of the people who service the customer.",They say that they believe in respect for the individual but don't practice what they say they believe. I have worked there since 1997 and have seen the good culture of respect for the individual thrown out over the saving of a few dollars.

speedis the key,"pull stock and then replace unused stock to warehouse. overnight management change brought a new young manager who ws demanding yet very unorganized. I walked on her asleep in the office twice and then she had another manager talk to me about speeding up my pace. When I was hired I requested Saturdays off and was granted this. The same manager asked me to work a Saturday and I explained that I could not. I volunteered to work Sunday when I was not scheduled. She agreed and when I showed up Sunday she sent me home stating that I was not needed. I called in sick two weeks later and she spoke down to me asking how many absences I had. I had not missed a day in the 6 months and told her so. She replied ""I have to check on that."" Very fast paced which I could not keep upto this managers expectations but the team leader seemed satisfied as he showed me how to operate the fork lift, trash compactor and spoke to me in a very team oriented manner. Some of the co-workers were very smart and very helpful. Others seemed to try to put me in no win situations. One example was they placed me to pull cosmetics that involved small make up bottles with very small bar codes in dark areas that were rather hard for me to read and handle. Remember I come from a construction background where the handling of these small bottles was rather difficult. Yet I would allows pull the heavy items readily and eagerly.",4,Former Employee,Over-night stocker ,"Albuquerque, NM Eubank",12/18/18,2018,12,18

Should be temporary,Wal-Mart is not a great place to work. Your expected to do the work of 3 people but they only want to pay you half of that. No overtime allowed. You don't always get 40 hours. Management is horrible and it's hard to advance. The pay and benefits are not enough to live off and suck.

Walmart,"I had a great time working there. I learned a lot of things of how to manage the front end and around the store. I learned how to operate certain things around the store as well.

Okay job,Wasn't really the job that made me quit. I would page for a manager to help a customer and they would take forever to come help the customer ( sometimes causing customer to swear at me or leave ). Other times they would call the phone and ask what the customer needed instead of walking to help customer in person. Walmart says customer first but thats not so much the case apparently.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"South Bend, IN",12/18/18,2018,12,18

The task was a little overwhelming.,Nice place to work for if you can keep up with the fast pace of the job.  The breaks seemed short considering you were on your feet for 8 hrs.

It was a job,"A typical day at work was normally hectic because if we weren't constantly busy with customers in the deli, we were busy with prepping, inventory, helping customers in other areas, and cleaning up messes in the back. I didn't have a very good experience working there because I wasn't taught all the skills required, and management would get upset because my performance wasn't as good. At random times during the month, managers would have a party for themselves or third shift and wanted fresh food, which was a challenge when we shut down the fryers at a certain time.",3,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Morehead City, NC",12/18/18,2018,12,18

Poor management.,"I did love working for Walmart. I liked my co-workers and my immediate bosses.  _x000D_The upper management, though, were unrealistic.  They expected too much from Cap 2 for the amount of workers we had on our team. But our team worked hard and did the best we could under the circumstances.  The circumstances being the back room was too crowded and not big enough for the volume of freight we received on a daily basis. This made us have to keep breaking down the line while we were unloading the truck when another truck would make a delivery or when a department manager needed to take freight from the bins._x000D_Above that, we were given many duties as our responsibility. We were expected to finish stocking so many pallets of freight on the store room floor.  Not only our remix freight but also over-night's freight as well. _x000D_ We were also expected to pull all the freight from the back room to the showroom floor in 2 hours from 9pm to 11pm, to do top stock, zoning, customer service, binning, cardboard/trash for other departments and shifts, organizing the backroom to make room for unloading the truck and then cleaning up everything in the back room and organizing it when our shift ended. _x000D_We were expected to do multiple tasks that require time away from our three main duties of unloading the truck, pulling the freight onto the floor and stocking the remix freight. _x000D_We had expectations of us that seemed unfair and unrealistic. Everyone on the team felt undervalued.",3,Former Employee,Cap team 2 ,"Rehoboth Beach, DE",12/18/18,2018,12,18
"Great Company, but needs improvement","A typical day for a Cap 2 associate would be, attending the daily meeting, prepping to unload the truck(s) for the day, setting up the freight line, unloading the truck, pushing the freight down the line, getting the freight for the zone you are supposed to cover, stacking freight onto a pallet, and when the truck is done, you go out onto the floor to stock the freight. I learned how to work as a team to accomplish a task in four (4) hours, I learned some leadership skills, and I had the pleasure of training new hires. The management was not adequate in their knowledge of information, but they still went above and beyond to make their employees feel safe. The overall culture of the workplace is a tight-knit community that watches out for the other coworkers back. There was not too many hard parts about the job, besides having some coworkers not pulling their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help my customers find what they needed, recommending products, and going the extra mile to make sure my customers left happy.",4,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Westworth Vlg, TX",12/18/18,2018,12,18

They taught me everything I needed to know. It payed well.,"Walmart taught me what I need to know to do the job. They were good at letting you know when things changed. However management was crazy. It seemed like it changed every week which made it difficult to know who to talk to about things you had questions about. The pay was good I started out at $9 an hour then after about 3 months I went to $10 an hour. After being there for a year their pay rate changed. I then was being payed $11 an hour. I would recommend it because the people their are nice and it pays well. However, if your not willing to work hard its not the place for you. The hardest job is the times you have a set time you have to get something done if you don't get it done by that time then you have just put everyone else behind. The easiest was being about to talk to my supervisors. Management is a different story sometimes it was easy others I had to wait a long time to be able to talk to them. Also they will some times change your schedule or mess it up. They are very excepting and will take anyone who needs a job. There is no discrimination.",3,Former Employee,"Cap team 2 Associate at Walmart at Washington, MO ","Washington, MO",12/18/18,2018,12,18

Fun,"Being a cashier was fun because of the coworkers and the awesome customers.  Black Friday was my favorite day to work because I like the challenge of checking out as many customers as possible and quickly so.  I did not enjoy though, that I was trained management positions but never paid at those levels.  I would train cms managers and in customer service and then they would get the promotion over me.  I became the ""fill in when they call in"" person even though I mostly worked positions above my pay.

I worked mid-shift so when I would clock on, I would head out to the lot and begin transporting carts form the lot back to the store, this was fast-paced as the carts would quickly be used due to the sheer volume of customers coming through, so there wouldn't be a lot of down time. there were peak times and slow times, but regardless of how slow it got there was always a few carts out in the lot that we had to collect._x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job - I found the hardest part of the job to be how often I would be running around collecting carts. It wasn't really difficult or super taxing, but more of a constant pace, so unless you were closing, your job never really stopped._x000D__x000D_The most enjoyable part of the job - In my opinion, the most enjoyable part of this particular job was how we got to work outside.

I have tried again and again to communicate with them both on the clock and off, both over walkie, phone calls, office meetings and regular chats, and was told that nothing was going to change. They expected work to be done faster than was actually applicable, their actions when on register was questionable which I would constantly help to correct, and whenever work would be done or completed, instead of any form of confirmation of the job well done, there was only criticism on how it was done, even when it was done correctly.

The work environment was unsafe and I was injured within just weeks when a unsafely balanced heavy box from the distribution center fell on my arm. We were asked to continue working while slipping in Dawn dish soap that had broken onto the floor. It is their policy to continue working no matter what happens until the truck is done. _x000D_Best of all you are paid just barely above minimum wage. Even when you go take a break they count the time it takes you to walk from across the store (4 minutes) as part of your 10 minute breaks. If they catch you actually sitting for 10 minutes like a real actual break they will get angry.

You get discounts and PTO, which is nice as well. Good place to start getting retail experience, easy to advance in the company if you catch the eye of upper management. Hours are rough most of the time and very inconsistent, 38 hours one week then 30 the next. I have had to take a half hour lunch every day instead of the usual 1 hour, just so I can get more hours.

"very busy job, very stressful, never enough time or help","I feel its a great place to work if you are a cashier, they make $11 an hour starting out, which the rate you start at is pretty much the rate you stay at, you only get a 2% raise if you qualify a yr. which means it does not matter how good or bad of a performer you are, everyone gets the same raise, which stinks, if you are hard working, dedicated employee.  Great if you are not.  The job is very fast paced and requires a lot of moving and lifting and multiple tasks.  Their is never enough help and tons of call ins that require constant helping of other departments and areas, which always seems to leave your own area abandoned.  There is never enough time or help to do what is actually required of the department managers.  We have too many  meetings that take our time up and  we are always pulled away from our own areas to help in other areas they feel are more important.  I feel like I cant do a good job because I'm not given the time or the people  or the programs in our tools that work fast enough or efficiently to get the jobs done in a timely manner.  I love the job but just don't feel like my hard work and dedication gets any recognition or more pay.  The upper management seems to play favoritism and only certain areas and managers seem to get the help they need or the credit they deserve.  Nothing is hard at the job it is just takes so much time to do most tasks and management does not seem to acknowledge or understand that for some reason.

Fast Paced Environment but Poor Management,"Every day, I would review with my co-workers on how the work day has been.

A Good Family To Work With,"Walmart has had a good history of trying to take care of it customers and it's associates. The company makes you feel welcome and important no matter how insignificant the task seems. You go in help the customers, finish your tasks and go home for the day. No matter how rough the day can get, you can always talk to some of your fellow associates. After a while you realize that everyone working there are your second family.

Treated unfairly. 50+ hrs per week. Lack of teamwork,"I worked for Walmart as an Assistant Manager for almost 10 years.  As a manager, you are treated like a door mat.  You’re expected to work 50 to 70 hrs per week with no appreciation for your hard work.  You constantly have to watch your back because the environment is so cut throat that anyone will throw you under the bus to protect themselves.

Stressful,"I can say I worked for walmart for almost 3 years. The company is crude to floor-bound associates and even worse for unloaders like I was. Granted they demanded that they have things done in a reasonable time when I first started, gradually, they kept getting worse and worse. They honestly thought that a truck could be done within an hour. Though this was highly optimistic about getting things done. They went as far as to add more people to unload trucks which was harder on us unloaders because we couldn't move around as much, considering they demanded that they have us in fixed positions. I can see how that works for new employees but doesn't work with experienced workers. I perform better as a floater or someone who helps with who needs the most help or what needs to be unloaded faster. I'm just glad I got out of there before it got worse.",2,Former Employee,IMS Associate/Unloader ,"Bentonville, AR",12/15/18,2018,12,15

Workload,The workload is unreal but if with no customer service it can be completes; it contradicts the goal of the store to have stockers stop working the freight to go completely across the store to assist in shopping.

Working at walmart,"Probably one of the worst jobs I’ve had, needed money and I liked my co workers but management sucked. And my house it’s didnt cover my bills. It takes a certain type of person to work there",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Redmond, OR",12/14/18,2018,12,14

"Cut throat, You are just as good as the number you perform at",I worked at the distribution center as an order filler and then as a fork lift operator in the freezer and refrigerator. I'm just going to share my personal experience and not sugar coat anything. It is a very fast paced environment. I had four days off during the week but its not with it when the three days you do have to work are like burning hates.  The pay is good but it doesn't add up to as much as you'd think in your head. you end up working an average of 30 a week and after taxes make 850 a check on average which turns out to about 1800 a month. Not much opportunity for overtime either. I started losing eyesight from cold constant temps and you are expected to bust yourself into the dirt to make productivity. After your training curve if you can't hit 100 percent they start calling you to the office and giving you occurrences every week. Driving a forklift I wanted to be more concerned with safety so as to not damage things or hurt anyone and because of this I didn't make production and eventually got kicked out the door after a year and a half given to was mart. TO WRAP THIS UP THERE ARE PLENTY OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE MUCH MORE MONEY IN A MUCH LESS STRESSFUL MANOR. Would not recommend.,2,Current Employee,Fork Lift Operator ,"Macclenny, FL",12/14/18,2018,12,14
Great friendships but terrible time,"I worked at Walmart for four years, two over night and two evening shift. You meet so many great people working there but management doesn’t care about any of their employees.

Hard job,You have to pull a certain percentage of product every night or day you work. If these percentages are not met them you can lose your job. Sometimes it would take 2.5 hours to fill one order and the pallet would be 7.2 cubic feet high. it is a hard job for a woman but also it depends on which part of the warehouse you are working in.,4,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Ochelata, OK",12/14/18,2018,12,14
Very stressful job that was sometimes not worth it.,"There is no normal day at Walmart. Good for a first time job. They cut hours for no reason a lot, and trying to get time off is extremely hard.

They required me to share everything I ever learned, ignored most of my best advice (because it wasn't what they wanted to hear), then blamed me and the technology vendors who sold us the software, for not achieving objectives that some mid-manager sold to upper management (based on expectations abstract from reality,and contrary to what the SME and vendors selling it, would ever endorse).  After years of this awful mismanagement, most of those managers have been laid-off, the vendor relationships are sour, and the experts hired to ""fix it"" (including myself) are laid-off, and replaced with inexpensive very agreeable visa-bearing warm bodies, at less than half the cost of the hardened veteran SMEs discarded._x000D_I still adore this company, for the tremendous good it does all over the world, but must warn I.T. people that my experience serving within Walmart Technology is not a rare exception, rather an example of what the majority of seasoned I.T. pros that refuse to compromise truth for false metrics.

I got along just fine with my last supervisor and when she changed roles I put in for the job but was was passed over for another associate from outside the store (which is fine). The problem is that this current supervisor is one of those people who likes to take it out on others when she is in a bad mood, while I am not the only person she berates, I am the most conveniently available. Upper level management has overall ignored this and only recently has spoken with this supervisor about her behavior, even then nothing is changing for the better. Other management behavior that is making this job unsustainable is ignoring problems, playing favorites, and relying on threats when negotiation is attempted. Our benefits have been changed radically over the last few years, as well as the pay structure, making raises very small, also hours cuts can happen with little to no notice, making budgeting difficult._x000D_Walmart doesn't HAVE to be a bad job, but unfortunately their management seems to be trained more for company loyalty than actual competence as managers, especially when it comes to employee relations.",1,Current Employee,Claims Associate ,"Loveland, CO",12/13/18,2018,12,13

My coworkers and I were like family. We were all about team work. Most of everyone that works there works very hard. It was sometimes fast paced and it was always something to do, if you couldn't find anything, all you had to do was go ask a manager and they would find something for you to do. The hardest part of working at Walmart was when we were understaffed and the store was really busy it was hard having only one or two registers open when there is a thousand customers inside the store and it was a lot of days when we were understaffed.

Managers don't care how you feel as long as you get the work done so they can get all the credit. The hardest part of the job was that they pull out so many pallets out on the floor and give you a time that the work need to be done. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people.,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Stocker ,"Sumter, SC",12/11/18,2018,12,11
Only go there if no other options,"Worked as a cashier for 3 years before moving over to photo lab. The customers are manageable, other associates are ok, but management is crazy. They have favorites and their open door policy is a joke. If there is a problem just go straight to the store manager if possible. I had an issue with a CSM bullying me when I first started and told my department manager about it and that was a mistake. It got worse after that, but luckily shortly after the store manager first the CSM due to her bad personality. Managers will ride you until you quit or do something so they can fire you. Also management does not know their on attendance policy and dress code. If you get hurt on the job then be sure you will get fired after being released from the doctor. They will begin to nitpick until they have went though their policy of how they write you up, then they fire you. When I went through their training the LP pretty much told us if you get hurt on the job, then you get fired later down the road. On the flip side - if you can get the managers and store manager to like you then you’re set.",2,Former Employee,Photo Lab Technician ,Georgia,12/11/18,2018,12,11

"No guaranteed hours, they favour PT over FT","I worked there for about a year and a half and it was one of the most miserable times of my life. When I first started, things were okay. I got to work full 40 hour shifts starting in the morning, which is what I wanted. However, as time went on, my schedule started to drastically change. Management forced me to change my availability so they could schedule me in the evening, even though there many PT employees available in the evening._x000D_They keep going through schedule changes, and when it happened, EVERYONE lost hours and got shifts they did not prefer. Management gives you fluff responses when you ask why your schedule changed. Another schedule change happened where they give you ""Guaranteed hours"" and these were so small, like I was FT, and I was ""guaranteed"" like 16 hours a week! _x000D__x000D_It is evident that they much prefer PT employees as many FT employees don't get their full hours, plus many department managers' positions were getting deleted, meaning you had to transfer somewhere else or leave. They are slowly trying to get rid of most of their FT employees._x000D__x000D_Management typically plays favourites, especially when you are trying to rise up. They never want to try and fix problems, just ignore them or give really temporary solutions. _x000D__x000D_The culture here is terrible. It's like working at a prison. It's almost cult-like too.

Being a Greeter is not easy,I ran into countless problems and issues being a greeter at walmart. I also was treated with no respect whatsoever. Every manager was telling me to do something different than what i was previously told. I was coached 3 times with no actual error made on my part. The work culture was very negative and people would complain about there job frequently. The Loss Prevention team would tell me to stop people at the door and act as security before they apprehend them.

Enjoyable yet stressful,Typical day for me at Walmart is getting to my department and seeing the amount of pallets left for me to work on my shift. Most of the time we have either less or no associates in the morning shift so that makes our closing shift associates in charge of the freight and taking care of the department. Management is a hassle to deal with and they treat most of their workers as slaves and expect them to do everything they ask us to do. The hardest part of the job in my opinion is to deal with all the stress when managers come and ask you to fill this item up when your on another task and they continue to do that but when the previous task you were completing isn't done then they would start complaining on that. What i enjoy the most is that I get to interact with different people who understand me and help one another.,4,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate/Customer Service ,"Lawrenceville, GA",12/11/18,2018,12,11

I also have my Support Manager who covers all 4 areas along with a secondary SM. They are under the ruling of a Co-Manager and a Support Co-Manager.  I generally have 3 pallets of meat that I have to downstack, scale, and/or directly place onto the sales floor. Anything that my handheld 'pings' as overstock, I stock into the steel. Throughout the day, I help customers, refill areas of the meat wall that are empty and keep my work area clean and safe._x000D_I've learned a lot while working at Wal-mart including the use of a pallet jack, MC40, TC70, how to easily befriend strangers, how to uphold excellent customer service, how to resolve unpleasant situations between others, how to train others efficiently in a short timespan, how to work safely, among other things._x000D__x000D_The negative of working at Wal-mart is that if you ever get sick, doctor's notes are completely worthless unless your body is broken and then you have to go through all the cartwheels of getting all your paperwork together under the same roof and pray it all goes through smoothly.

Management sucks,In my opinion walmart is a great company as a whole i just had a problem with a staff who was a manager .

The benefits make you feel special.,"You're badge works as both a reminder, and your clock in system, depending on where you clock in at. Either you start by swiping your badge or you type in your account and hit sign in. its both an easy, fast, and user friendly system to clock people in. Overall, the walmart experience from there depends on the job you applied for. But no-matter what, every job seems to involve interacting with customers. The one thing walmart employees all over seem to fail at is remember the 5 foot rule; ""If a customer gets 5 feet near you, you must greet them, and ask if they need any help"" Although it sounds like a simple rule, a lot of employees walk by so many customers, nobody ever wants to follow the rule. If you work under 6 hours, you get one 15 minute break, but if you work over 6 hours, you get one 1-hour long lunch break and two 15 minute breaks. It was a very fair and manageable system. The only system that needs to be improved in my experience; You are not allowed to talk to a manager about your job unless your on the clock. As a cashier, other employee's relied on me to arrive so they could go on break, if im in the back for 10+ minutes talking to the manager, then my employee has to wait longer to take their break, and if that employee needs to use the restroom, their pretty much doomed.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Brigham City, UT",12/8/18,2018,12,8

Stay Away from Walmart!,Walmart intentionally creates an 1800's Slave worked Plantation atmosphere.

Stressful but nice place to work,"Most of the Managers at the Walmart that I worked at were all buddies with each other so if you complained about a manager for harassment, they ignored your comment almost completely. The coworkers I had kept the place fun and inviting. The hardest part of my job as a cake decorator was that I had three different managers telling me three different things, like they were never on the some topic. Along with that, before I quit, they hired this untrained cake decorator for me to train and she was absolutely irritable, she never did anything by the book and brought in many complaints. So that showed me that they were too desperate to hire someone for the job, that they didn't care much for qualifications.",4,Former Employee,Cake Decorator/Baker ,"Fenton, MI",12/7/18,2018,12,7
Reducing staff to save shareholders money,Bare minimum staffing and emphasis on pushing products out the door over anything else.

Very team oriented job and lot of communication required.,"On a typical day at Walmart, I would usually open up the Deli and set everything up so we can start cooking food. I was also able to work in produce and stock fruit while also cross training in bakery to learn how to prepare donuts and bread. I learned how to work well around a team and also take a leadership role when supervisors and managers were not on the job. Since I worked a with a lot of foreign people who have a similar background as me, I was able to help supervisors and managers communicate with employees because I was bilingual. Management had its ups and downs, as from time to time there would be lack of communication between the manager and the employees and therefore would result in missed orders, products not being stocked, or overall just slowing down the pace of the workplace. The workplace was very welcoming, everybody treated each other like family and communication between the associates was very strong. The hardest part of the job was the constant schedule changes that associates would make which would make it harder on others because now we had to pick up shifts that didn't suit us. The most enjoyable part of the job was that everyone was generous and if you didn't know how to do something, associates who were experienced, were more than happy to help you.",4,Former Employee,associate ,"Denver, CO",12/7/18,2018,12,7

I would still be there,"Honestly I loved what I did at Walmart. I had a leadership role in the store and loved working with my team.

I could have been the best employee in the history of Walmart and only ever was told and I quote ""this close to exceeds"" to get a raise. Two, was management. This was the biggest hitter to drive me away. The unrealistic expectations. The job I performed was online sales in store. It relied all departments of the store to have accurate on hands of merchandise and fully stocked shelves. That was never the case. I was expected to find and fix all missing merchandise and other department issues. They have department managers for that that would never be held accountable for their departments.

Hate/Love working at Walmart,Morning shifts go by fast and closing shifts are nightmares. I learned to be straightforward and higher tolerance of being patience. There is a lack of management which is one of the reasons why I left this company. The workplace is always busy with customers which is a great sign for sales. The hardest part of the job would be getting treated differently by management. The most enjoyable part of the job would be giving a customer service and great to see that they are pleased that you helped them.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Katy, TX",12/5/18,2018,12,5

Decent work for a college student,If you're a laid back worker with a good mental stature you will do rather well. If you get your feathers ruffled by drama and wrong doings of management then stray away. The harder you work the worse the managers look because they don't like to work. So if you work hard you will be singled out as a outcast. This job felt like high school all over drama and rumors everyday.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Cart associate ,"Fairmont, WV",12/5/18,2018,12,5

The face everyone loves to hate,"Walmart isn't as bad as many people make it out to be. The worst part about working there is the customers. They are selfish, manipulative liars. Most of the customers that come in are EXTREMELY rude and are only looking to cause trouble. Retail work is always draining, regardless of the store or company you work for. You put in time, effort, blood, sweat, tears, etc. and most of the time you don't even get a 'thank you.' Walmart is at least trying to improve on the life of their employees, rather than demanding everything with almost nothing in return_x000D__x000D_TLDR; be nice to walmart employees please",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"New Martinsville, WV",12/5/18,2018,12,5
Was a decent place to work. Mostly fun people. It's a paying job.,"They say opportunities for advancement, but in our particular store, they hired from outside most of the time. And half those people didn't understand the roles they were placed into. Pay was decent, but unless you've worked with the company for many years, someone doing half the work of the entire store got paid the same as a door greeter. Most of the people at my store were good people, fun and caring. The crew I worked with seemed like the best of the store. Learned many things while working with them, from those who had time to share what they knew. Helping people is what it's about. Loved interacting with customers, hearing short stories, learning a little about them, having fun, while attempting to help them with their needs",3,Former Employee,Cap Team 2nd Member ,"Keokuk, IA",12/5/18,2018,12,5

It's not for every one,They have an established business and its not going anywhere. The pay is decent. But be ready for a lot of unasnwered questions. Walmart corporate makes all decisions down to store level and a lot of them make no sense. Their store management system is flawed. However they do provide more than average amount of resources for associates to help them when they are having a hard time. Applying for that help is a nightmare though.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Terrell, TX",12/5/18,2018,12,5

Regular life and the hours didn't work well together,"Working as a cashier wasn't difficult work by any means whatsoever, however, roughly 70% of customers were rude and vengeful no matter how fast and well you did your job. Management wasn't helpful at all to the cashiers, the CSM's (customer service manager) rarely brought the necessary change refills, and when they did, it would take what seemed like a lifetime.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Booneville, MS",12/5/18,2018,12,5

Working at Wal-Mart has been better than my pervious job.,Walmart has it's pros and cons. Management is mixed with views on policys. When you need to change your availability they give you problems. The my share is nice as well as paid time off. They have some benefits but has to come out of your check. When it comes to wanting full time it's very sketchy.,3,Current Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Ocala, FL",12/5/18,2018,12,5
Hard work pays off,"I don't mind so much the work. It could be worse. I'm just a cashier so all I have is a lot of back pain. There are times during my shifts when they forget my breaks so then I go the rest of my day without my last break which is very much needed, but because we are so busy lately I can't have a minute to get off my feet.

Not fair pay compensation.,I enjoy the work in the deli. The work is easy when you have the right amout of people working. Loved my hours. 1-10. Its so short staffed that I am alone those hours 4 days out of the week. Its impossible to do a 4 person job alone. You would think the managers would help or send some one to help but no one gives a care in the world about you. They will let you struggle and they will complain when extra tasks don't get done. No matter how much you ask for help when you are alone. Also when you try to leave the deli they won't let you. When asked if I would be able to advance in the future I was told no right away. That I was to valued were I was at. I have no intrest staying with a company that won't alow me even the possibility of advancement. I am actively looking for a diffrent job.,2,Current Employee,Production Associate ,Wisconsin,12/5/18,2018,12,5

A great place to work,"My 8 years with this company has taught me many new attributes. Such as leadership, kindness, and most of all how to work safely. My management has always been amazing to go along with the associates I work with. The hardest part of my job is the physical labor that I have to maintain on a daily basis, hard work is the only thing that makes my company achieve its goals. Along with the difficulty of my job, there is also a enjoyable part. Meeting new people, the sense of accomplishment to look at something and say to yourself ""I give it 110%"" and that is what keeps me striving to do better, not only at a job or for a company but in everything I do throughout my life.",5,Current Employee,Orderfiller/Forklift Operator ,"London, KY",12/5/18,2018,12,5

Great job if you need a job quick. Real opportunity for advancement if you work hard,"Walmart is the juggernaut of retail that everyone loves to hate, but in my experience, Walmart is a decent job for retail. The work is pretty easy, customers are nice (for the most part), and it's rare that you have to seriously exert yourself. The discount is nice also and it's pretty easy to get more hours if you show you're a hard worker. There's also a genuine opportunity for advancement if you enjoy retail. _x000D__x000D_The drawbacks are that you might have to work in cold or hot environments if you work in the meat or garden departments, occasionally you have to deal with rude customers, and managers often have a chip on their shoulder and can be rude and angry. The pay is low also, but it's relatively easy to get more hours. _x000D__x000D_My advice to anyone that works at Walmart: Take the job seriously. Show up on time. Work hard and don't make excuses. There is genuine opportunity here if you work and try hard.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Raleigh, NC",12/5/18,2018,12,5

I Have mixed feelings about walmart both good and bad,"I have mixed feelings about Walmart, in NY they are a great company to work for. they pay well and listen to whatever concerns you may have. you always count on them to be fair with your work load and disciplinary actions.

When working in GA i found that management often lie and use disciplinary action to cover up there own shortcomings.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Eastpoint,GA",12/5/18,2018,12,5

Good for college but its a career killer if youre looking for something more,"The job is good if you are attending college, my schedule was Saturday-Monday 36 hours per week.  The main thing about this job is when the work days start to slow down it heavily effects the employee, at a time in 2018, Walmart wasn't  getting any heavy business so we would average 8-10 hours per week and this happened mid to the end of summer. _x000D__x000D_When it starts slowing down the management tries to find reasons to write employees up and fire them so they can start hiring when its time for the holiday season. We lost 3 employees in this period some of whom were working there for 15+ years because of this ""weeding out process""._x000D__x000D_Benefits are good, warehouses don't do lunch anymore so you have to either eat on your 20 min break or while doing the work. _x000D__x000D_Production is horrible and I feel bad for every new person after they reach the 4th month in this occupation, if you arent ready to hit 100%+ production good luck. we've lost a lot of employees just based on this ridiculous standard._x000D__x000D_PTO generates 1 hr per every 17 hours worked which is horrible but the longer you work there it goes down in increments, after two years of working there I generated 1 hr per every 15 hours worked. _x000D__x000D_benefits are okay and the pay is good for college students if you have a degree definitely find something better than this.",2,Former Employee,Dar Unloader ,TX,12/5/18,2018,12,5

I also feel like they blame associates when customers coming in rage off the street and we cant snap back when there threating us or calling us out of our name. Associates should be getting the higher pay because store managers and so- managers don't do anything or at least some of them. We handle customers and make, shelve products for sell. We are the one who cashes out customers and give them the experience. You barley see management. Only to write you up and make you do more then you already handle.

Poor Communication,"The work is not difficult. While there will always be dissatisfied customers in retail, the real negative aspect at Walmart for this individual was management. There is a severe lack of respect in communication between management and the associates. Associates were preoccupied with others actions rather than completing their work so the whole was not punished by management for one individual's failings. Management pushed unrealistic expectations on associates and punished accordingly when the expectations were not met. When problems were brought to management for discussion associates were talked down as if the error was solely our part and associates needed to try harder. _x000D__x000D_The work itself is not difficult and the customers at times though challenging are understanding of retail workings and limitations._x000D_Walmart by far has superior benefits including 401K, days off, higher wages, and a flexible work schedule that allows for requested days off.

"Decent starter position, lackadaisical management","A typical day could mean anything from stocking shelves, loading customers, working a register, pushing carts, cutting fabric or organizing the backroom. In that regard variety kept the work fresh and even fun at times. I learned proper time management and cleanliness standards for maintaining a diverse and seasonally different area. Management was definitely a drawback at this facility, in that it was rotated multiple times over the duration of my time there leading to misleading styles of leadership and constant redirection of standard procedure. The overall culture of Walmart is highly inclusive, but as with all places if you are not on the inner circle you are just another face in the crowd. Job difficulty only arose in times of staffing issues, as long as we had enough people on the floor work was manageable which often lead to opportunities to assist in other departments in the store when your primary area was taken care of. I enjoyed most working with customers, helping them find items and recommending comparable products if what they sought was not immediately available.

"Challenging, metric tracked, draining work, but fiscally proficient.","A place of steady if not infinite workload on more active days, with also quiet days of training and managing offline work. Overall corporate relations are generally favorable, whereas customer relations tended to(and did) drain workplace morale and staffing consistency. An average day could entail more than 80 contacts to resolve with only brief spaces before the next contact would ensue as it was genuinely encouraged to reduce wait time between individual contacts as much as possible and judged if one had higher wait times between calls than others. Structure was highly team oriented with meetings and monthly competitions to ensure higher productivity/metrics. Moving on to culture, 3 words: ""Happy to Help"" I will never get them out of my soul, it is permanently ingrained and will never leave as I now respond to everything with that subconsciously. The most difficult part of the job is and will always will be the customer, be it the actual customers who visited stores or the employees(associates as Walmart prefers(who are also considered customers as anyone who called us was considered one)), civility was usually never an option from them toward us. Which considering one of Walmart's core tenets is still respect for the individual, that was not afforded to us on average.

I was  willing to learn more about the pharmacy tech position in which I was not being trained in since they hired someone from another Walmart work site in the south to fill that position.  I went to a training program specifically for Pharmacy Tech but It appeared that they did not want to take the time to train me because of the high volume of customers associated with the pharmacy on a day to day basis.

Not for me.,I can't speak for all Wal-Mart's but the one I work at has such poor management I can't stand it. Your goals change every day and you're never really sure what your goals are because they change half way through your shift at times. Communication is poor unless it comes to making sure your work is done in the allotted time then they are great at harassing you to hurry up and get done. A lot of them talk down on you and they cut corners and it's just an overall head ache._x000D__x000D_ Like I said I can't talk bad about all Wal-Mart's. Some people are good (though most are gone now) and the pay is better than minimum wage which is it's saving grace if you can keep out of the politics then it wouldn't be that bad.

Management,I worked as an assistant manager. They expected me to stay over up to 6 hours after my shift ended to work n other projects.

They have higher expectations for them without giving them the knowledge of a seasoned associate on equipment and policy issues.,3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Dayton, OH",12/4/18,2018,12,4
Fighting to Stay Afloat,"Walmart is stuck in a loop of attempting to protect their image, and trying to create the highest amount of profit. This often times leads to the media being shown one thing and associates experiencing another. An example is the pay raises that have been advertised over the past few years. Every time a pay raise is announced, there is a dramatic scale back in help. In the three years I worked there my department alone went from having three fulltime and a parttime associate who received 25-30 hours a week, to having two fulltime associates and being told there were no more hours available to schedule even for empty shifts or lunch breaks. _x000D_Even the salaried managers are being harmed by this as they are forced to work well over 40 hours a week just to make up for the lack of help on the floor._x000D_Also, the health insurance is terrible; it has certain common medicines it won't cover and has a high deductible.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Marion, IN",12/4/18,2018,12,4

worklife,"Walmart like many companies is having some growing pains and adaptability issues. They were once a great place to work that really cared for and took care of its employees. Fast forward to the last 10 years and it it is a different company than it was. By eliminating positions, combing positions, hiring outside companies to audit things like the unloading process that have no clue about them just prove to people who have been there 15 or more years that they really have no clue how to adapt and want to make the most unrealistic and asinine changes to try to connect with it's customer base, all the while alienating it's employees who are easily 15 to 25 % of that customer base",3,Former Employee,Over Night Cashier and Stocker ,"Montgomery, AL",12/4/18,2018,12,4

I learned a bit about supervising, how to utilize the tools for the position and what safeties and precautions to use. Management differed on a daily basis, some let me stick to a schedule I had made up where as others had me bouncing around the store trying to wax floors. It was a pretty great workplace, people all got along, you got to get to know customers from time to time and communication was pretty good for the most part. The toughest part of the job was trying to stay consistent, being asked to rewax areas that were waxed recently etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a good team that always knew what their job was and we all worked together pretty well.",5,Former Employee,Clean Team Supervisor ,"Elk River, MN",11/30/18,2018,11,30
Walmart not good for mental health,"Walmart is fast paced with high turn over. They will push people through the training and even have other people take the tests for them. They try to keep everyone part time ,so it's very hard to get benefits and full time. Management is very slow to respond to the front end which in turn exacerbates the situations they are needed to deal with. Different managers will give you different direction on handling situations so it is difficult to know what to do. There is definitely a cliquishness with the employees that makes it  a lot like high school. This can make it difficult for new people to fit in. I also was shocked at the amount of interpersonnel dating and relationships going on in this store, which in turn makes working tere very uncomfortable at times. While through out the training they tout customer first as their policy it is not followed through on at any level in the store. It is extremely difficult to find help or to even get back up doing busy times. This is especially stressful on any middle management roles in the store.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Bradenton, FL",11/30/18,2018,11,30

Worst place ever,This was the worst job I’ve ever had. They don’t accept doctors notes at all and will fire you even with one. They don’t pay very well at all and it’s not enough to live on. The managers are inexperienced in what they do and they don’t know how to treat people. Policies are rarely fallowed and when they are it’s only to use it against the workers. They put too much work on their employees and show no appreciation to them.,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Niagara Falls, NY",11/30/18,2018,11,30

Customers were a joy,"Customers at Walmart were a joy for the most part, of course you had those that were not but, patience is a virtue.

Cashier,"Job was fine when I would work in other departments. However, running registers up front can be extremely stressful especially because they cut their cashiers hours and only staff the bare minimum every day. That doesn't include the call offs which happened daily and left the front end registers massively understaffed. Customers complain to you for waiting in long lines when they should just call corporate and complain because that's the only way it will ever change. Wasn't a very friendly and welcoming staff, some were most were just cranky all the time. CSM's were lazy and got mad if they had to do their job. Expect to be told to do one thing by your department manager and then yelled at by another manager for not doing it their way.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tiffin, OH",11/30/18,2018,11,30

"Did not enjoy working there, I tried to work hared and had good attendance but there was no reward systme , only Sales got rewarded.","I had children at home, that I had to pay daycare for, when I ask for my schedule to be adjusted to not work more that 2 nights shift per week, they adjusted it, but then made it the schedule to be into the evening anyway. Also I ask to move to another Dept., at least temporarily and to get a break from where I was working, and it was not approved. Co-Workers were usually always finding other places to work outside our Dept, so it lesft 1 person to try and work several stations and try to take care of customers. Also part od time I did not have cooperation with management when I made a gun sale, was by myself and had to wait on Management to ""walk"" the gun out with customer so they could leave the store.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lavale, MD",11/30/18,2018,11,30

Iffy,"When you work there. Specifically if you're a picker. Im sure all management thinks all carts are equal, just grab a cart and fill orders. But lets say you get 6 boxes with single picks. Then must go to racking to fill them. From DA to AZ thats a FAR walk. Your overall picks are gonna fall. We shouldnt solely be based on our ability to grab items per hour. They should be judged on time between picks. Thats why your losing employees to TPH",3,Former Employee,Picker ,"Edgerton, KS",11/30/18,2018,11,30

"Hard work, not enough motivation to keep at it","Working among people who could just stand there ( quite literally ) while you're giving it your all and make the same wages is infuriating. Management is all over the place, and I wouldn't trust them to know my left sock from my right. Very unreliable. But the actual work, at least in my department, was enjoyable. I loved my coworkers, most of the time, and I was good at my job. The pay is satisfactory and the hours are nice if you need to cash.",4,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Niagara Falls, NY",11/30/18,2018,11,30
I enjoy myself there. It is an okay place to work for but as all jobs it has its pros and cons.,"Walmart is a give or take job. Promises made but not fulfilled.

Good and Not So Great,"Having worked at the DC for too long, I would have to say their corporate ideology is flawed beyond belief.

This culture, although still alive due to the wealth amassed by Sam Walton, will continue to lose out, if only because they fail to listen to what the average work wants. _x000D__x000D_For anyone looking for a job, I would recommend working there as a filler (between positions).

Demanding and pushy management,"Walmart is a terrible company to work for. Yeah the pay is 11 an hour but once you get to working, you realize quickly it isn't worth the headache the managers cause.

cashier at walmart,"They are very anti Union. They don't pay you near enough to support you. They do not allow flexible scheduling.

I came from another job to get a position here, and everything about this job was pretty fitting, but with a short life due to circumstances.  You learned a lot about the position you chose. Certain positions were more stressful than others, however. The hardest part about being an associate in general is not knowing the store, or understanding what's going on, because you will find that new employees may need more help than others. You get a pretty comfortable fit being a part of the company and all that is with it.

Great healthcare,"A typical day at Walmart for inventory control involves scanning the bins with merchandise and stocking shelves. If that particular item is overstock, then a correction is made on the handheld inventory device to ensure inventory control. If an end cap has a weak feature, then that item is removed, reboxed in case quantities and another item is placed on that end cap. Management walks the store, daily every morning to go over new features and changes. The hardest part of the job is being unable to advance, some associates who have been with the company for several years do not Always get considered for advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to take pride in stocking the items that a customer needs, and doing it neatly while providing great customer service.",3,Current Employee,Cap 1 Associate ,"Reedley, CA",11/28/18,2018,11,28

Horrible,Management does not communicate with each other. One manager will tell you to do one thing then another manager will get upset and tell you not to do that. It is impossible to to the job when management will NOT give you the tools you need to do the job. You will get asked to work over and the told to cut the overtime before the pay period ends. Hours are constantly cut. Working at walmart makes it difficult to balance work and home life. often have split days off so you  can't enjoy your two weekly days off together with your family.

Constant Stagnation with Management,"If you want to just work and make money - this is the job for you. But if you care about work, management's appreciation, and for work to be done in some what of an ""orderly fashion"" - this is not the job/career you want. Management in Wal-Mart is beyond stressful. One manager says to do this, the other says do that, it's like tug-of-war. Most people do not believe managers set the mood for their employees, customers, and numbers in sales. My Wal-Mart is proof that do not excel in all those categories . They over work you, especially if you're the early morning CAP 1 shift. This is one place that allows ""bad workers"" to do what they please (steal time, walk around, work at a very slow pace) and ""good workers"" to constantly be picked on and over worked.",2,Current Employee,Cap One Associate ,"Houston, TX",11/28/18,2018,11,28

Incredibly poor management and low pay.,"To start, the training you receive generally conflicts with the actual job and tasks that the management wants you to perform. As with most jobs the more you perform the more they expect from you, but rarely will you receive any extra compensation or benefit for going above and beyond. Employees can consistently arrive late or call out with little repercussion and the task load just gets dumped on whoever comes in. Rather than reprimand the problem employees management will berate an entire team because a task meant for 10 people wasn't completed when only 4 people showed up to work. When an employee actually manages to get fired it's usually from having called out too many times and you can expect it will be a few months before they finally hire someone to fill in the gap. As you can imagine this makes for an incredibly stressful work environment being consistently understaffed. The ""good"" employees combat this by constantly requesting (and receiving) time off leaving for a week at a time. The only time you receive pay raises is when you take a higher position within the company or a few meager cents when the annual cost of living raise comes around. I would never suggest working for Walmart unless you were in dire straits or just don't care about working conditions, which if that's the case you'll never have to worry about losing your job. So I guess you could say that there is an opportunity for job security for the desperate.",1,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Gardner, MA",11/28/18,2018,11,28
Just a number,"There isn't a lot to say about working at walmart. I worked nearly 40 hours every week as part time until my hours averaged to full time, then they cut my hours to 15 a week with no warning. Someone shattered my finger tip in the cardboard bailer, and management tricked me into signing a sheet saying it was my fault and wrote me up. They will not pay for the surgery I need on it. Management kept promising me specific promotions and promoted others instead. I was not paid enough to live on my own, and had to live with my parents.

Give credit when crecits due,I actually have a love/hate relationship for this company. They have awesome benefits and the pay from where I live you can definitely live off of it. The managers are pretty awesome they give us treats and things from time to time. We also get quarterly bonuses (depending on area they can be big or small). The only thing is you barely have a personal life with the overnight shift because you have to get an adequate amount of sleep. We have slow or fast paced days when freight can be light as rain which means the rest of the day may drag or you can have double the freight in which the day can go by fast.,4,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Springfield, IL",11/28/18,2018,11,28

Not good,"Training to be an assistant manager was great; however, when you actually got back to your store, it doesn't work the way they tell you in training.  A manager is pretty much on their own.

They gave us free water. There was a lot of freedom due to that you only had one job....pushing carts and using the machine. On busy days, there would be lack of electric carts, and you always have to be on a mission to find one for someone. Almost got hit by a few cars too, but I was careful.

Productive,"A typical day at work for me was make sure that every customer was taken care of. I learned how to handle certain situations without getting stressed out. I learned how to work both on my own and with other people to get things done in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was mainly just how often there wasn't coverage in certain areas. I had to cover six departments at a time sometimes. But that experience taught me how to multitask very well!

"Good pay, but a poor infrastructure","I was hired with for this temporary position at Walmart that was supposed to go from April 2018 - June 2018. However, I decided that it was better for me to leave this position before June because this work environment wasn't for me. Me and the group of people that were hired at the same time as me all went through the required training, but during the actual workshift everything was so disorganized. I remember one day I was supposed to meet with someone near the deli after I was done with my assigned task of sorting through various products, but said person never came and I was just left confused. There's also a lot of pressure that comes with this job as well. I was told to face all of the products in an aisle within 10 minutes, which wasn't enough time for me, so when my supervisor who gave me that task came back and saw that I was only about 75% done, I was promptly yelled at and left with a bad impression.

Good luck,"Walmart isn’t a bad company to work for depending on your location. If you don’t work in the suburbs then expect the worst even as an employee, but working in the suburbs is quite a hassle due to distance. It’s kind of a lose lose situation. Also they won’t hire you unless you’re “available” 24/7 so once you’re hired the scheduling is ridiculous. I could get off at 1am and they’ll have me on the schedule to come in again that SAME morning, not good for anyone with children.

I learned how to operate the cart machine so I could bring more carts in at a time. The management team was good for the most part. Most employees were enjoyable to be around. The hardest part working for Wal-Mart was when the store would get extremely busy and most employees had a difficult time keeping up with customers needs.

be careful with this one....,"At first you will be treated good and to be friendly with customers(just a front).. weeks later some people in management will just blow you off sometimes and stop being friendly. Don't get me wrong, there some good good ones in there, but the buddy system is definitely at play here so you have to be careful on what you say and to whom because retaliation is possible in one form or another.They are understaffed in this dept, taking advantage of the ones there, making them do double even triple work, so it's basically stressful work, nonstop, always on your back just so the dept can meet their quota.Sometimes you just get 30 minutes breaks instead of the hour Schedule is inconsistent and ever-changing, so you basically have to revolve your life around it. full timers get part time hours at times. they only want people with open availability and it's hard to get a second job with this one.

Management had about the same ratio of great and bad workers. Depending on how good you are in general with people determined how well you did with customers.

Retail World,"Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, and with that comes responsibility. The responsibility to maximize profits for the Shareholders. Regardless of how much money Walmart makes, if it doesn't hit a certain percentage, then the Shareholders sell sell sell. This creates fear for the executives, and in turn, they monstrously reduce wages to where there is nobody working in a busy store. The shifts are 4-5 hours tops, so that doesn't retain good employees. The pay is good, if you can get the hours. Nobody is surviving on 20 hours per week, without having multiple jobs. Regardless of how hard you work, it is a minuscule grain of sand in a desert. It is never noticed. The recent corporate Walmart is so fundamentally different than what it was 20 years ago.

"The effort, energy, positivity you bring to work doesn't matter here","Walmart is a company who can treat its employees any way it sees fit, because it's strong-armed america into such a vulnerable position that most low-income and below individuals without connections into real places of work will have to work there to make a living in their young lives(everything here isn't researched just my lived experience and the hundreds of people I've worked with at Walmart over the course of 3 years). _x000D_With what I've said above in mind I can say nearly every job(non-degree) at Walmart is so brain dead simple that if you're looking for an easy job look no further.  As easy as it is to butter a piece of toast, except that you're buttering thousands of pieces of toast every hour and any leeway to do something else not brain dead is heresy.  What I mean by that silly analogy is all the thinking for everything you do here is almost done for you.  You have no choice/chance to lead the pack or innovate.  The way you can ""impress"" your superiors and move up the tree here is by being their favorite person to talk to. Anything work related, so long as you do what you're told has no relation to getting promoted here.  _x000D_I've held six different positions with Walmart ending with department manager, all the while struggling to keep positivity while putting in so much effort.  As a Walmart employee with hopes of moving up in the chain to gain respect and an increased wage I kept enough face value positivity to get promoted to department manager.

My job was at the customer service desk I handled money and took care of helping customers getting their returns and exchanges done. I answered their phone calls and took their complaints. This job taught me many skills on how to deal with customers and how to use a register and handle money and how to check in and out tils. Moreover, overall management were great, only few of them were not very understanding and only focus on getting the job done. The rest of them are always there to help associates and customers and make work enjoyable. Workplace culture was awesome I met amazing people that taught me many things and made work easier. Hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customer, lazy co-workers, and a very busy holiday time. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my customer service managers in the cash office and putting returns back on the shelves.",4,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate ,"Glendale, AZ",11/19/18,2018,11,19

"Relaxed work environment, Very strict attendance policy","I believe Walmart's a great company to work for all around excluding their attendance policy. If you call out more than 3 times within the first 6 months, you're immediately terminated. No exceptions. I had called out once when I was sick, and then 2 weeks later I was on my way to work when I broke my arm and had to be rushed to the hospital, I was out for 2 weeks but still received 2 more attendance occurrences for it. So on the 3rd of September I had gotten incredibly ill but knew that if I called out sick I would have been fired. As soon as I showed up, the manager had sent me home immediately and told me I'll get a call back regarding my employment soon. It's been 2 and a half months and there hasn't been an attempt on their end to try and reach out to me. I've called several times asking for the manager and even walked in each time it's the same ""we'll see what we can do"" and no word back from them.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Wasilla, AK",11/18/18,2018,11,18

Good Job,"Good Job. Management is more or less a mess, and from what I've heard, it's like that at most Walmarts. Benefits are okay. Job is easy but sometimes frustrating because of management wanting you to stay over, but not wanting you to get overtime. Aside from the store manager, there are several assistant store managers. These assistants often step on toes with each other and each have different jobs they want you to perform aside from your main responsibility, and often are angry when you either don't perform your main tasks in favor of their tasks, and vice versa.",3,Current Employee,Assembler ,"Hartselle, AL",11/18/18,2018,11,18

Great job just poor supervisors,You'll enjoy working there but your supervisors will drive you to look for another job. It's emotionally and physically draining how they constantly just use you. Nothing is ever good enough for them and you are constantly reminded how replaceable you are. They say they are family oriented but after a miscarriage you get two days of grieve and back to work or you lose your job.,3,Current Employee,PICKUP TODAY ASSOCIATE ,"Lawrence, KS",11/18/18,2018,11,18
Just Don't Work Here,"I worked for Walmart for 5 years, and I can honestly say, unless you're desperate, you don't want to work here. I only stayed 5 years because I wanted to do all I could to get promoted, and when that didn't work, I left. I trained 3 of my direct supervisors. They didn't even understand why I was asked to train them and not just given the job. Walmart does have good health insurance, which was nice. They've also made it easier to call out when you need to. It use to be that you had to call, hope someone answered the phone, wait for a manager to care enough to talk to you, then you'd be guilt tripped for whatever you called out for, before being abruptly hung up on if you didn't fall for the guilt trip. Now you can go on a website and tell them you won't be in. That makes it much easier. I think Walmart does drug test when you get hired, but that didn't stop us from having a high number of stoners working there. Didn't blame them though. Most of the employees were either stoners or raging alcoholics. That's how we all dealt with working for one of the largest companies in the world that still can't pay their employees enough for them to survive without public assistance.",3,Former Employee,Inventory Management Specialist ,"Cornelius, OR",11/18/18,2018,11,18

Typical Day,"Walmart is very inconstant with their schedules. There is never a set schedule, you may work a closing shift one day and then work an opening the next and it just goes back and fourth like that. I felt as if TLE were underpaid because of the conditions we had to work in. Yes it's on the same pay grade as bakery and electronics, but they don't have to put up with the weather nor the hundreds of nasty cars that came through that we had to service. Also management was to nice. I understand that you have a policy of trying to sell to a customer, but there was multiple times when we would decline a vehicle for various reasons, ex. nail being to close to the sidewall or a hood latch being broke, and when the manager would come out he would tell us to do it because the customer went inside and whined and cried to the manager. Like I said I understand the policy of making customers happy, but there comes a time when you have to back your employees and trust that their judgement is true.",3,Former Employee,TLE Technician ,"Johnson City, TN",11/16/18,2018,11,16
I appreciate the opportunity they give me but they need to fix a lot of things.,Its a company that you can learn a lot if you propose but lack of other things that affect the employee.

Also 15 minutes to build 2 8 foot tall pallets of potatoes cucumbers tomatoes in plastic crates boxed items and somehow at the end of it all trying to put 15 giant pails of frosting on top of it all isn't enough time. Eapecually when the majority of your trips consist of these and your expected to keep moving as fast at the end of the 12 hour shift as your are at the beginning.

Horrible place to work,"Walmart is the worst job I’ve had. The managers are horrible. My child was sick and I needed to be off and they didn’t care to take me off the schedule.

Lousy,In my experience there i was treated as expendable no job security and the open door is a joke. I went thru proper procedures that led to me doing the open door with management. Serious problems with things not getting done. I worked in the deli. Resulted in me getting fired for petty reasons i saw it coming but still hoped my concerns would be taken seriously. To this day two years later these things are still not getting done. Q&A should catch on,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Buckhannon, WV",11/15/18,2018,11,15

It was my favorite job to date.,"I would typically go in and work a solid 7-9 hour shift. Nothing crazy. I learned to not take a job for granted because I miss it, for real. The only thing I disliked was that they wouldn't let us get more than 32-34 hours a week, and they seemed scared to give us overtime. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers.

About Walmart,"Overall , the pay is good when you are a teenager with no bills but as an adult , no. They won’t give out over time or let you come in days they actually need somebody.

Wal-Mart Work Experience,"Hours usually do not exceed 40 per week. Overall experience heavily depends on who your managers are. Flexible scheduling, however they really prefer open availability as well as people who can work early morning shifts and weekends. PTO (Paid Time Off) is accrued over time based on average weekly hours worked. Employees can buy company stock as well as have a 401k plan. Recent educational benefits were added through a company called Guild. If you are majoring in a Business degree then Wal-Mart will help you pay for college to an extent towards specific business degrees. It's $1 a day, or $365 per year, that you must contribute to this program if interested. Overall working here can be stressful especially when short staffed on weekends, but compared to other retail companies the pay is higher and it's not always stressful. It really depends on the scheduling and the day of the week. _x000D__x000D_Pros: Higher pay, flexible scheduling, education and health benefits, 401k, and paid time off._x000D__x000D_Cons: Not always enough hours, limited room for advancement, corporate culture could be a bit better, and the health plans aren't the best.",3,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Jacksonville, FL",11/15/18,2018,11,15

"Fast paced, very productive, and keeps you active.",The most enjoyable part of the job I would say would be meeting all the new and interesting customers that walk up to your register.

I believe one of the most important things about any company would be to keep all your customers happy that way they keep coming back.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Concord, NH",11/15/18,2018,11,15
Amazing Place to Work at with Poor Management,"I loved the job itself and some of the people that I worked with. There was always things to do, but management had obvious favorites and treated those people differently.

dont work here durning the holidays,"okay, so if you are looking at joining the walmart family, what ever you do, do NOT join between nov 1 and jan 1. plain and simple, the customers are horrendous during this timeframe. their holiday 'good cheer' goes out the window as soon as halloween is over. suddenly, no one believes in kindness and it's always the associate's fault. if you do end up joining during this time frame, be ready to be cussed, belittled, and blamed for every little thing going wrong in the customer's eyes. suddenly, you are their fall person. my advice, join in january, it will give you the entire year to get too invested in the company and your co-workers to want to leave when the hammer of christmas comes down on your head.",4,Former Employee,Cake Decorator ,"Holland, MI",11/15/18,2018,11,15
It's Work,Walmart overall is a good company to work for. I heard many horrible stories about how they don't offer benefit and they work you full time hours. Those are lies. Sometimes there is no organization when giving directions coming from managers. This is is why its best to pay attention learn your job(even if its on your own). Whatever your job is be present (mentally and physically). If you show good work ethic and come to work you shouldn't have any problems. _x000D_It is always changing so if you don't like change and need a job then adjust with the change. Changes could be from a floor plan to a planogram to a process they told you about 5 minutes ago to changing it again. _x000D_Advancement options are available with Walmart but they take time. This is what get on my nerves especially if they know you have the skills to do the job.,3,Current Employee,Associate- Stocker ,"Athens, AL",11/15/18,2018,11,15
My college job,"I worked at walmart almost a decade ago when I was in college because they allow you to change stores and I hopped around schools. I did pretty much everything in the store from cashiering to mixing paint, but the place I was the most familiar with was jewelry counter. I pierced ears, ordered custom jewelry, created displays, and I really loved it. It was the perfect job for me because I have chronic pain._x000D_The only reason I left walmart was because I have fibromyalgia. I was involved in a car accident. My doctor advised me not to lift over 15 lbs and therefore I couldn't return to work due to the fact walmart's liability policy states you must be able to lift 50 lbs. Nothing at the jewelry counter weighs 50 lbs, I can assure you. However, at that time, they were combining jewelry with the shoe and accessories departments. I cannot go up and down ladders with my health issues so that is why I couldn't return to work. I suppose they could not or would not accommodate me. I was forced to leave the company and find work elsewhere. I was devastated, but if I didn't go to work at First Data, I would have never met my husband.",3,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Papillion, NE",11/15/18,2018,11,15
Never enough cashiers on duty.,The job itself was not bad.  I kept busy most of the time.

fun place to work,"nothing bad to sayWorking at Jet everyday there was no surprises in what my responsibility was. I was thoroughly trained in various functions to understand what i had to do for most given task whether it was picking, shipping, inventory control, put away, or dock. The management were fair but stressed the importance of out performing sister locations like the Warehouse in New Jersey as well as completing daily targets. Jet.com once hired on or temp they offered company fun days like going to local college football games or days where lunch was brought from various eateries.

It was ok,"At Walmart the work isn't really all that hard.  Honestly the hardest part was the inconsistency.  For the majority of the time i worked there, i never knew when my next shift was going to be.  some days i would work until 11 pm and then start up again at 7 am.  It was not easy with how few employees there were, and the workplace was just bleh.  There were very few people who you could talk to and really get to know, and they were gone before you really got the hang of things.

Overall,Management is complete cramp they never are on the same page with anything. They never check schedules to make sure there is coverage in the area you work in. They say they have many opportunities to move up in the company but if you are too good at the job originally given they’ll never let you leave that department. There is a point system you can’t call off more than 8 times in a 6 month period which isn’t bad at all but they claim to terminate you if you pass it but they keep certain associates. I’m my opinion isn’t fair because they always seem to save the bad works and get rid of the good. I was let go but knew of other people who maxed the points out by four or more and where kept. They switch your assistant manager every few months and mine happened to be a manger who didn’t like me so I got terminated quick. He said”I rather struggle than have someone who calls off” doesn’t make sense because  in the bakery/ deli you need 5-6 people at all times but never would hire anyone so there were four of us now only three.,3,Former Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Scranton, PA",11/14/18,2018,11,14

Everyone's experience is different,"My experience with Walmart in a word is sporadic. There is no such thing as consistency at Walmart. There is obvious favoritism shown by management towards certain associates, micromanagement from longtime associates, and what seems like a growing trend of moronic behavior at the hands of corporate management who have become so far removed from reality that they have created a fantasy universe all of their own that it actually seems to be a pleasant alternative to the reality that is the dumpster fire most stores are when they have to juggle the inane whims of Home Office and the myriad denizens that roam the aisles. _x000D__x000D_To put it mildly, I have had an experience at Walmart, the same way a person would say they had an experience in India, except there's probably less fecal matter to deal with in India.

Poor management and never ending drama,you can work your butt off all day/week/month long and never receive any credit or a simple good job from the store manager or any of the assistant managers. I'd say all the managers are terrible except two. The workplace is always so negative and no one has anything nice to say about anyone else.

Cut throat and competative,"As salary management, its cut throat and competative. You have to be relevant to the future. It's a high stress environment that encourages you to work more hours than what you are scheduled. In my experiance if you dont work late as salaried managment you get ridiculed by your fellow management team members. There is a distinct lack of team work, and a culture that nurtures you to put yourself ahead by putting others behind._x000D__x000D_Being and hourly supervisor or hourly associate isn't too bad though.",2,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Texas,11/13/18,2018,11,13

Walmart was very productive but just like any job you have your peak times of the day,"A typical day a walmart i was schedule and assigned a register most of the time I would work midday so, for the most around two to nine is  our most busy time throughout the day especially on sunday and saturdays so, as far a fast paced the front end will always be the the most busy due to customers checking in and out and we are the most important we have to make the customer feel at ease while allowing them to channel positive vibes and good spirits leaving the customer a feeling upbeat and fully satified with the experience before leaving the store. I learned alot working for walmart  I learned how to obtain self control, how to appeal and uplift different types of persons such as there interacting with different personailties without offerending anyone. The hardest part of my job was when it was time to get off the clock and I was a fast cashier and I always use to challege myself on how fast I could ring someone up will at the end of the shift every one use to some how come to my line and i would try to accommdate everone without turning anyone down.....

"""Easy work"" made difficult","Working at Walmart seems to be a great starting place for a high-school students first job, unfortunately, it isn't. Many of the managers and higher ups simply have no consideration or concern for any of the workers lives outside of the store. For example, my school has many mandatory events for it's various programs and showcases, my managers wouldn't allow me to have the days off to attend these mandatory sessions, since I was desperate for the money, I had taken the hit to my grades by not attending the mandatory events. Also, they'd see any possible opportunity to berate the younger employees.

"Okay place to work for, management below par","Throughout my time at this company, I have noticed that the managment there shows favoritism and retaliates against the workers they do not like. For example, if you speak to your direct manager and they do not provide you with the help you need, and you go above them they will intentionally sabotage your work experience. Although, this may be true for the majority other members of management, not all are like this. Some members of management actually want to see you succeed, even if you go against them and go above their heads.

it's walmart is a summary really necessary,"management could never communicate properly among themselves to get on the same page about where they were pulling employees from and what departments or tasks were being covered. they also used to love working part timers 40 hours a week for 11 weeks, and on the 12th week of working your hours were slashed to 12 hours so they could avoid making you full time.",2,Former Employee,Electronics associate ,"Boothwyn, PA",11/12/18,2018,11,12
Good place to work for people who are on their own,"If you're completely open with your availability and don't have anything tying you down, Walmart is the place for you.  If you work hard, you can advance quickly.  If you have a family and are limited on what hours/days you can work, forget it.  While you can put in for what you are available for, you won't be guaranteed  any hours.  Contrary to what the ""haters"" want you to believe, Walmart does provide good benefits.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Detroit, MI",11/12/18,2018,11,12
Okay workplace,I would go back now that there is new management. The pay was good considering what you were doing.

Better Management,"There is a lot of favoritism at Walmart. The managers have their favorites and they don't mind letting you know it. After being there for like six months you get to pick your availability, but management wants you to work during the times you are unavailable. Then if you don't work they count it against you and then you are fired. Even if you have a doctor's note, Walmart does not honor the doctors note. I think this is a policy that needs to be changed a little because life happens outside of Walmart. Walmart would be a better place to work but there should be no favoritism and honor people's health reasons for not being at work.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Sumter, SC 29150",11/12/18,2018,11,12

Not enough money and the bullying from coworkers is too much,Co workers of Walmart bash remodel employees just because we are there and say we are in there way and that we are useless.

Great working environment with really nice co-workers/managers with really nice customers.,"Wal-Mart was my first ever job and I loved it to the moon and back. Most days when I went to work i really looked forward to it because of all the wonderful customer that made your day and the co-workers that loved help and chat when the time is appropriate. I usually went in for 8-9 hours days working up to 40 hours a weeks. They're many things that I learned working since it was my first job. For example i learned to work better with others making many friends along the way, customer service, and just communication skills. The managers at Wal-Mart are really great to work with and whenever I needed help the were right there to help me along no matter what I was going through. This might seems stupid and i'm trying to my myself look better but the hardest part of my job was usually leaving. To be truthful I loved my customers and co-workers because no matter when I was going through I had them to talk to and they could usually make my day bright and  for time to time I made their day better when they were going through rough times. The most enjoying days is to talking to people and seeing how fascinating people lives are and seeing different things everyday. I really didn't how well Wal-Mart benefits were because i never used them because i was still on my parents insurance. I would definitely recommend to my friends how great Wal-Mart is to work for.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Lewisburg, PA",11/11/18,2018,11,11

Great experience working here just sad that the hours changed,I loved working for them they promoted me within 6 months of working there to a manger and payed really well. They also provide benefits such as stock 401k and insurance with blue cross which includes dental eye health. They had excellent management and were quick to help their associates anyway they needed ( they livied up to their motto “Happy to help”). I would have stayed here if we hadn’t changed from a 24hr store to closing at night which really messed with our shifts.  But other than that they really help you with cross training and getting you ready for any other jobs you can apply it to.

Most of your time is devoted to helping customers which can be a good learning experience, provided that if you need help you can get it quickly. This job does offer a whole plethora of jobs to chose from which is really excellent but comes with on huge downside, if you wish to advance your position in whatever store section you choose you will find that management is not very willing or accepting to let you try and achieve that goal. When I heard of a new shift manager or similar position I was told by my managers that it was not possible to achieve, not because of lack of experience or that someone was a better fit but simply because they did not want me to hold that position.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"South Jordan, UT",11/11/18,2018,11,11

There is a lack of effort and integrity within the store,"I worked at Walmart for almost 2 years, and realized that the management does not take accountability for the lack of effort and unbalanced work load for it's associates. They ignore the slackers, while overloading the hard workers to compensate for their laziness. There is little room for advancement overnight for a few reasons. They expect you to bail out the other shifts and complete your own work load, even though the overnight crew is short staffed, and has half the associates of any other shift. There is a lot less upper management overnight, so the store manager and comanagers only see the results, not the effort it takes to achieve those results. There is no lower level Management positions available during the night shift, so we would have to switch to days to advance in the company. In my 2 years of working at Walmart, I've seen nearly 20 promotions. Only 2 were from overnight, and the associates had been there since the store was built. On the other hand, a majority of the other promotions were given to associates who were hired months after me.

There, I did well enough to be recognized as a good worker by my coworkers, unfortunately my supervisor seemed to have it in for me and worked with the same manager that got me moved before to move me to the lowest station in the store, Maintenance. Where I had the lowest pay grade, had to do their expected work for a janitor, and STILL had to work backroom, as well as run miscellaneous jobs for the other employees, such as running back and forth to collect things from them and assist customers carry out large items, while having to run to the bathrooms and clean them and empty every garbage container around the store. I would consistently be yelled at for not getting to a bathroom, when it was feasibly impossible. Such as during black friday crowds. Or when the ladies room accumulates many users of the facility. Being male, I need to wait outside politely. So I tend to go do my other tasks, and be berated for not getting to the bathroom immediately. I was also frequently sent out to assist the cart pushers bring in carts. I did every job in the store for the least amount of pay possible, and had constant harassment from the management about my job.

Walmart,Depending on which area you are assigned to determines what kind of day you will have. Each department has their own requirements. It use to be fairly easy to meet the requirements. But as time went own processes started changing supposedly for the better. But some of the changes has caused more issues than anything.

Assosiates were great to work with!,Very poor mamagement in top positions. Very poor morale in general as far as the morale that Associates have.

Walmart Warehouse,"Intense manual labor is an understatement. You are in a trailer loading freight for twelve hours a day and maybe more during the holiday season. You work either a 3 day schedule or 4 day schedule. The average freight for a day is around 6,000 to as much as 8,500 per lane a shift and the weight of each box can be from 1 lb up to 150 lbs. The average box weight is around 30 lbs and will break you until you become used to it. There is no air conditioning in the warehouse and Florida temperatures in the warehouse exceed humane conditions. During the summer they provide water bottles but starting in October, they take the water away and you have to bring your own water. They do have fountains to fill up your bottles or jugs but they are disgusting due to the dust flying everywhere in the warehouse. While the manual labor is intense, the pay and schedule is fair. Maxed out worker makes $20.60 an hour. Perfect for a college student and there is many of us.",3,Current Employee,Loader ,"Brooksville, FL",11/9/18,2018,11,9

Decent job,"Decent place to work, but could be better. Management can be very over the top at times, letting their position get to their heads and not being very open minded nor respectful to the associates. However, with hard work and consistency, one can advance within the company which is a positive aspect of the company. I started in Stationary (office/school supply area) and ended up in the Vision Center where I am now studying to become a certified Optician. Sometimes rules are bent or simply voided. Although I'm full time, at one point my hours were dropped to one day because business got very slow, therefore, I had no choice but to pick up hours at a location very far from where I live. I couldn't understand how that was even allowed being that I was hired on as full time; that experienced proved to me that absolutely anything is possible at Walmart. I was not happy at all and felt very used and abused. The pros about working at Walmart are you get to meet most of your community people and then some, you have 2 breaks and a lunch break, PTO hours are accumulated in a decent timely manner, and you can advance reasonably within the company. I never planned to stay as long as I have with Walmart, but I like my present position with hopes of mastering it.",3,Current Employee,Optician Apprentice ,GA,11/9/18,2018,11,9

Life at Walmart,A typical day for me at walmart starts with unloading a truck and then pulling the pallets and carts to their departments. This job is not an easy job and can become very stressful at times. Working at walmart is not all that bad except when you have managers who are more out for their own pockets by keeping down hours and lack of employees. also the lack of communication and lack of training. I want to work for a company who appriciates my work.

Alot of really gret people with open opportunity to advance.,Walmart had both good and bad sides as does any job.

It was usually lighthearted unless we had a busy shift where we would talk about what was expected of us and where we could help if we finished our task early. Management was usually understanding and tried to help where they could, which made it pretty easy for me to work there. Other employees were very approachable and I was content working with them. The most difficult part of the job was knowing that what you had to do that day was urgent, but still making sure that the customer felt welcomed and could always get help if they needed it. The most fun was my old manager, he'd always make conversation and help where he could. He would make sure that we felt welcomed and would try to cook food for us once a week.

It's paid hours to work if you're desperate,"Honestly, the only reason to take a Walmart position in North Windham is for money's sake alone. They pay on time, but that's about where the benefits end. Rampant favoritism, disregard for corporate policy, and a a promotion structure that requires you to be among the favoured few to rise. Even then they might just discontinue your position on a moments notice giving you little time to find a position that maintains the same pay.

I started off as a cashier within 3 months of working I received a bonus and a chance to apply for a different position. Due to me completing and graduating my pathways and (CBL'S) Computer Based Learning. A few months later I learn that was recommended for a promotion from one of my supervisors as a cashier. So I got promoted and another bonus withing a couple of weeks of being recommended. There is plenty of opportunity to grow and learn more at Wal-Mart.

Working for Walmart can be a fast-passed and demanding job. But the work is relitivly easy.,"A typical day in Walmart was random at best. For me as a Garden center associate I could be working in Garden center, or literally any other department. Most of my time was spent working in the automotive and hardware departments. Mostly because the previous associate was terminated. My jobs when I was in Garden center ranged from Zoning, which was pulling items forward and making the aisles look good. I also stocked and took care of re-shops. Other jobs in Garden could have been assisting customers on the cash register or unlocking grill and lawnmowers after the customer purchased them, then helping the customers load them into there vehicle. I also stocked and zoned the dirt and mulch, then I helped the customers load purchased dirt and mulch into there vehicles. I sometimes had to come in early around 5 am to water the flowers. And some times start my shifts at 10 at night because I wanted to help out with department mods. Mods are how the aisles are set up from the shelving to the product, and prices. Me and a team of other associates had to set up the new mods. From taking down the original shelving units and items to setting up the new shelving units and placing the items in there new homes then pricing them. Other jobs I did in Walmart were running a cash register in the front of the store. I did stockmen/cart pusher work and helped out in any department that needed assistance that day.

They scan what they want while shopping and before they leave the store they use the walmart pay option on the walmart app to pay without going through a register.

"Walmart 2518, a demanding environment that helped me mature.","Walmart Store 2518 is where I learned, developed, and refined everything I know about customer service.  I had the privilege of learning from some of the most thoughtful and patient supervisors I have met in my life so far, whose experiences I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.  They taught me how to conduct myself in one of the most dynamic and fast paced retail environments in the state of New Jersey.  Upper management can be very demanding, but they will recognize hard work and diligence when they see it.  The workplace culture is very diverse, often shifting as the staff changes frequently.  But while I've seen many come and go, there were few I didn't enjoy working with.  In that sense, recruitment was mostly consistent.  The hardest part of my job?  Disciplining my subordinates, which I had thankfully done very seldomly.  The thing I enjoyed the most was finding the answer to a problem, be it for a customer or an associate.  It's kinda like being a hero; seeing a troubled face, asking what's wrong, and using my experience and resourcefulness to resolve the issue.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor/Manager ,"Hamilton, NJ",11/6/18,2018,11,6

Horrible Management for a Decent Job,"Managers don't work with your schedule, no matter what they would like you to believe. I worked there for three months and never received any assistance with direct deposit, so I had to pick up my checks on my downtime because Personnel was never in. I never received the sticker on my name badge, so I manually had to check in each day, which became tedious when everyone around me could just swipe and go. I got scheduled on days that I had closed availability on, and rather than fix my availability, the managers would just tell me to submit an availability sheet when I already had submitted the sheet several weeks in advance and they had yet to put any of it into the system. On the day I quit, it took me nearly 3 hours to find a manager to speak to about it. It was an appalling and miserable place to work in, especially when the managers tried to save face for their own mistakes by scolding team members just because it was an ""Academy Store"".",2,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Ontario, CA",11/6/18,2018,11,6

The management is extremely horrible; there are a select few managers that try to run the business correctly, while picking up the slack from the majority of managers, all while the sales associates get the blame. The pay is decent but the income becomes quite small due to the fact that the schedules are incredibly inconsistent; most times I would receive 8-12 hours a week, while I would receive 20-30 hours a few select weeks (keep in mind that I am considered a full-time employee). Other than that, the job culture is incredibly dull and draining.

Promotions more often occurred without interviews, instead going to an individual pre-selected by management. Often, more qualified applicants were not considered due to manager preference many times based on the personal rapport with the decision maker. Turnover among salary management was high as well, resulting in associates needing to adjust to a new style every few months or so.

According to assistant managers, all employee work hour schedules were computer generated.  If you specified certain hours on any given day during a week to be scheduled; they could and would reduce your hours/days for the entire week.

Productive with opportunities for new positions in the company,Working at Walmart can be very stressful depending on the customers and other associates.  I learned how to deal with people better even if they are being complicated. The best part of working an 8 hour shift is the 2 breaks you get and the hour lunch. Some people get alone with the managers and other people don't get along with them at all. The work place at Walmart is if you don't know where something is find another associate close by and see if they know where an item is and go with them to that area so that way you know where it is for the next customer who asks.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Waterloo, NY",11/4/18,2018,11,4

The people I've worked along side have been, for the most part, great colleagues and good friends. However, I've witnessed and worked through trying situations that could have been prevented, and a number of issues that have come up are poorly taken care of.

"Rough, hard work","Overnight stocking is very rough. Not even your best work is enough.

It's a job ~ Overnight Stocker,"This will differ based on shift, and honestly store location. Usually I would clock in, go to the back for the shift meeting. They would rattle off important numbers projected sales, truck piece counts, and then area assignments. _x000D__x000D_You would then go get your scanner/printer/labels/carts/ and jack. Depending on the area you may have to downstack freight onto the carts or it may be preloaded. _x000D__x000D_You would also walk into freight that hadn't been touched from previous shifts and be expected to work it with the new freight. After you worked it you would have to sticker and bin it in the back store room. While also making sure that you faced and zoned your area. _x000D__x000D_Then, if you were a faster worker or a higher paid worker.

The manager culture is highly toxic, encourages cliques, and playing favorites is sadly more common than it should be. Leading to very apathetic and unsatisfactory work environment.

Benefits are aplenty, which is great. Being fast at your job is rewarding as well. However, this job is not without issues; the staff at my store happen to be especially good people, but the customers can be the polar opposite; people will be people, and they can be ruthless. Walmart also mentions in their paperwork that they can put you in different areas (a stocker like me may be pulled to push carts or work dairy) and anyone who applies should be aware of this. Not that this was an issue for me, but there's no drug testing either.

Overall Walmart is a great company to work for.,"I have worked for Wal-Mart, all together, 27 years. I started before technology got started. Everyrhing was done with paper and pencil. Now technology has taken over,  it is suppose to make everything easier! We as dept managers used to make our own decisions for our depts. Wal-Mart calls this a store within a store. This allowed us to run our own (sort of speak) store. Dept mgrs are no longer free to do this! Now they have what they call one best way. One best way is the same for every store in the company. Dept Mgrs are no longer challenged to run their own business. We are now told what goes where according to home office. This is not always the best way in every store. Technology is definitely taking over. Apparently no longer able to use the marketing skills I have picked up in the last 30 years!! Time for a change!!",4,Current Employee,Dept.

One big family. Somewhat.,I adore the friends/coworkers i have met through this experience at Walmart. They make the experience more bearable than anything. Working at Walmart i see a lot of favoritism. Working there for almost 3 years i see the older employees getting pushed to the back while they give the newer people exactly what they want. Constantly cutting hours and taking away any overtime and sending people home on Fridays (even if we desperately needed the people sent home). That is if we can find equipment to do our jobs properly that most are constantly without.

Every walmart is different,"In my opinion, in leesville the store was relatively clean and well managed. The store in Valdosta I worked at was dismal and very condescending in that management micromanaged at a clip of unstopping monotony.  The store itself was very dirty and terribly miscared for. No one there seemed to be willing to work throughout the shift and the ones who did were reprimanded and mistreated. In short the staff was short shrift and very menacing.

The best thing about working here was that stocking, and organizing the things in the freezer and refrigerator as well as sorting through the expiration dates on the dairy side of things.

Walmart,Walmart is a pretty straight forward place to work I worked cap 1 so I woke up at 2:45am and got to work at 4am and start downstracking palets in frozen then we move everything on to carts and get it onto the floor after that we would bin all the overstock and run picks after picks we just top stocked the rest of the day,4,Current Employee,Cap 1 Associate ,"Waterville, ME",10/31/18,2018,10,31
"productive, very overwhelming",In my opinion walmart isn't the best company to work for. Their management team is very unprofessional and they expect you to have open availability all the time.

They aren't a very good company to work for.,1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Post Falls, ID",10/31/18,2018,10,31

Changing environment,"Walmart was better to work for years ago - not so much anymore.  There were more incentives, management was more relaxed, the culture and environment was fun and enjoyable - all of that has changed.  Senior management seems much more concerned with cutting expenses and increasing productivity than with how people feel about their jobs and if they like working there or not.

The interview process is great. But the post-hire period needs some work.,The interview process is great. They could work on working with you after you're hired so that there is less confusion. There compensation process needs a major update to our current economic climate. They could do ten times better with their work life balance. The management needs to get on the same page and be more communicative.

low pay equals high turnover,"pay is low, you cannot have overtime, after 6 occurrences of overtime you will be fired, they prefer to have their employees do twice the work for same pay, they pay is low for amount of work required, this opens the door to accidents/injuries, stressed employees to get the job done in less time with less help, which in turn causes high turnover, and unhappy employees.  Time off is often denied causing higher absentee, as employees then call off",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,Delaware,10/31/18,2018,10,31

A means to an end type of job,"Walmart in the past was an amazing company to work for. Very employee focused, meaning they appreciated their employees and showed such in their policies and how management treated them. Now all management are only out to try to move up, meaning they will step on anyone who they feel knows more then they, or can out work or out perform them. I was salaried management worked my way from hourly. I went into that position with the knowledge of how badly hourly was treated. Very high expectations with little to no tools and support to accomplish the task or job itself. Too often employees are thrown into a task or position with little to no training to accomplish said task or position. I was fired because I was pointing out what management was doing wrong. How the management was poorly treating employees. I was wrongfully terminated and corporate shrugged me off.",1,Former Employee,Auto Care Center Manager ,"Ponderay, ID",10/31/18,2018,10,31

Would not recommended,Not a good company to work since it don't value the associate or family values.  The higher your position the less time you have for your family and they don't care.  They set a management schedule to balance work and family and the store managers don't follow them.  Company implement new programs weekly but no one follow them correctly is all how is interpret by the store management.  Overall the less experience managers are the ones that get promoted or they hire from outside.  District mangers don't enforced policies establish by the company and don't follow up with ethics concerns from associates to find resolutions.  High turnover on associates based that they will have little training and they will have to do 3 person work for the pay and also the treatment they get.,1,Former Employee,Co-Manager ,"Orlando, FL",10/31/18,2018,10,31

Original values have changed and mine have not. Customer Service does not happen at Walmart.,Walmart has changed in the many years that i have been there. It is more about corporate interests than about customer service and the original message of Sam Walton's values which was family orientated and customer satisfaction.  I hear every day the frustrations from customers about the lack of help in the store and lack of customer service. The turnover is so high that the training is not happening at the level that it takes for real life help to occur. it is also difficult for a sense of community and a sense of pride to occur at Walmart.

I hated not being able to go home after my department was finished and having to clock out at end of shift but remain working to help other departments finish their tasks. I hated not being able to take regular breaks. I could go on but this gives a good picture of the working conditions at Walmart.,2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Wenatchee, WA",10/30/18,2018,10,30

Walmart can be a fun and productive place to work . there's room for advancement,A typical day at Walmart is busy. There's a lot of opportunities that's available. I learned how to manage and train. I love training new associates that's willing to learn. The workplace culture is mostly Hispanic and it caters to Hispanics because of the area it's located in. The hardest part of the job is coaching for production. I feel that everyone should pull their own weight. The most enjoyable part about working at Walmart is the customers.

Very stressful and pushed,"No longer any appreciation for their associates, poor management, you're unable to give feedback to help them out because it wasn't their idea, no lunch, now working all holidays, which means ""no family time"", you're watched like hawks, and someone that's been with company for 2 1/2 years is making the same as someone that's been with the company for 20 years.

Okay place with demanding hours,"Decent place to work. Very labor intensive. Learned how to push myself past my limits as we needed energy for a 9 hour shift consisting of heavy labor. Culture is okay, meetings before every shift to boost morale which is good, sometimes with treats. Hard part is if someone is slacking, everyone stays until job is done, which at the end of the day can be very frustrating. The good part is the seasonal events and the employee lobby with a TV.",3,Former Employee,Unloader/ In-stock Team ,"Harlingen, TX",10/30/18,2018,10,30
It started out well,"Sadly watched the company-wide morale decline significantly over the last 10 years. Great salary and compensation, but little work/life balance.

review,Walmart can be a good place to work if management take responsibility for the many problems policies bring when it comes to their associates dealing with the demands of Customers. Many associates felt as though they were not being heard and had a tendency to not fully do their jobs or even show for work. This in turn caused extra stress on other associates.,3,Former Employee,"cashier, stocker ","Morrow, GA",10/30/18,2018,10,30

"Just like any other customer service job, could be stressful but not a bad place to work",I’ve worked at Walmart for 5 years and haven’t had the opportunity to move up to management or anything in the company.

some employees can careless,"stocking shelves is very important when it comes to rotation so you don't end up with so much expired product.

Stressful and not much fun,Most customers were rude and argumentative.  Managers were pushy and made threats if we didn't get our share of credit cards.

Challenging,Overall Walmart is a good place to work. There are a lot of options for working here. There is an opportunity for advancement. Cashiering at Walmart is the last place the customer visits. Keeping up with the demand of customers cashiering can also be a very stressful thing. The Holidays are the worst part of cashiering and there never seems to be enough cashiers scheduled during normal business hours to meet the needs of customers.,4,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Burley, ID",10/30/18,2018,10,30
This place was managed so poorly,"This place was managed so poorly.  They can't keep the place stocked, they treat their employees terribly, never give them time to do the computer work they need to upgrade their pay status or improve their job status.  I asked constantly for time to do my computer ""tests"" to get the promised pay raise, they never had time or the computers were down. the training staff was rude and made fun of the company (which should have been a sign to leave right then & there!)  Some of the managers were very clickish, actually I felt like most of the store was that way.  Each department had clicks, I felt like I was in high school again.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Fallston, MD",10/30/18,2018,10,30
Relaxing and good communication,On a typical day at Walmart would generally start my day in the Walmart back room. Where I would generally begin by unloading and sorting merchandise that would come off the truck. After that my day would consist of running freight in different departments for the rest of the day.,5,Current Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Indianapolis, IN",10/30/18,2018,10,30
Pure parasite corporation,The minimum wage pay rate has left multiple employees that I am aware of homeless. They punish employees with fewer hours if they are not available 24/7 (even if that does not allow you to sleep).  They under staff to the point that the job (keeping customers happy) is impossible to do well.  The small 10% employee discount does not normally include food.  Training is minimal and the videos doing it are often out dated.,1,Current Employee,Ascociate ,"Downey, CA",10/30/18,2018,10,30

Hurtful,"Its Very Hurtful that the company computer tells one thing on attendance and the next day you get fired.

Bad workplace,Too much favoritism. Too much unprofessional management who don’t value their hard working employees. They used them to do all the hard work while they look good for their bonuses and in the process promoting the favorites that haven’t earned their positions just based on who related know one another or usually sleeping with one another. Don’t use open door it’s a joke all the managers mostly lie and stick up for each other all you’ll be labeled as is a snitch for voicing the very same problems every one complain about so they are aware and simply don’t care.,1,Former Employee,Stocker ,Virginia beach,10/30/18,2018,10,30

"Ok, but not good as a career","I worked at Walmart for 7 years, and I think it was ok, but I wasn’t very happy towards the end.  I’m much happier now that I don’t work there.

Not a place I would work again,Always remember that just because a policy is in place DOES NOT mean the company/management will follow it. Certain policies apply to certain people.

Would not recommend others to work here.,1,Former Employee,Assistant ,"Bentonville, AR",10/30/18,2018,10,30
Good job with good pay,"It was a wonderful job , however the management isn’t very compassionate (speaking solely from my experience with one store).

Management,I jointed Walmart's management team as an external. There was little training and what little there was was very poor. They put you in a classroom setting for five weeks that had little to do with our actual jobs forcing computer tests on you and when that was over they threw you to the wolves. Management is stretched thin. We can't do a good job because we're pulled in 100 different direction every day at the same time. You're always damned if you do and damned if you don't when it comes to prioritizing and making decisions. The market manager than comes in occasionally and treats you/talks to you like your dirt in front of all of your employees. The job has good benefits but it's just not worth working 65 hours a week and that time still isn't enough.,2,Current Employee,assistant manager ,Pennsylvania,10/30/18,2018,10,30

I'd take my lunch break and returne back to work afterwards. At the end of the day I'd help with the clean up and lock up. Before I leave the building I'll go to management and sign out the lock up keys for electronics department. I've learned to never leave the company building with the Keys, keep the aisles clean as possible and clear, to always keep work space clean, and if a customer askes me a question and I do not know the answwer; tell them that I don't know the answer to their question I can get a manager for them to answer the question.

If you don't brown nose than your chance of promotion or training so you can get promoted is almost nonexistent. You do form close bonds with the other associates that are at non salary position, but it is mainly formed by the feeling of being overworked and angry with the higher ups.

Terrible management and enviorment,"I worked at Walmart for two years as an electronics sales associate. Throughout that time I covered on average 6 other departments, because Walmart is too cheap to sufficiently staff its stores. Per company policy there should be no less than 3 associates in our department at any time due to it being a high theft area yet for the last 2-3 months I worked there my shift consisted of me regularly being alone for most of my shift or only one other person with 15-30 customers in the department at the same time. Management was not dependable whatsoever for my last few months my schedule was outside of my availability every single week and I had to bother the manager 5+ times a week to get them to fix a schedule that should have never been ruined to begin with.",1,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Orem,Utah",10/27/18,2018,10,27
I loved my job,I didn't like the point system because who can only miss three days in six months especially during Flu and cold season. Cap 2 is a very tough shift and super fast paced.. I enjoyed my overnights because it was more laid back.. I was a beast at my job so I'm sure they hated loosing me but I had to miss work due to family issues an court so I could not meet there point system guide lines which they will do there best to work with you but you have to give a three week out ahead of time notice to miss work so of something comes up unexpectedly and you have no extra points then pretty much you screwed out of your job.. sad face,5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Bartlesville, OK",10/27/18,2018,10,27

"Pay doesn't equal, workload","Walmart is a great company to work for if you don't have many choices. Pay for assistant store management isn't great for the amount of hrs you have to sacrifice for the company. Its even worst for some associates. Typically as an assistant store manage you are scheduled to work at least 10hrs per shift, often times it ends up being 12-13hrs.You will have 50-100 notes to complete by the end of your shift and more than half of them will probably take hrs. You have no life outside of work because you're mentally exhausted and all you can do is sleep on your days off. Say goodbye to your life and hobbies. You may even get CALLED in if you're in management role. Management is dog eat dog kind of environment, instead of bonding together to accomplish goals and notes everyone talks about one another. Stay away from the crowd with negative energy you quickly become involved in all kinds of drama. The associates work better for managers who they tend to know personally or whom are facebook friends with. The associates will rally against you, if you coach(accountability) one of their friends, and don't expect other management to back you up. The hardest part of the job is trying to impress your store manager and the market team but its never good enough. There's always room for improvement, don't expect to be appreciated for a hard days work. Trust me, it won't happen. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all types of different customers some can make your day and some can pour salt on an open wound. Avoid working at Walmart, its not worth the stress and headaches.",2,Current Employee,ASSITANT STORE MANAGER ,Georgia,10/26/18,2018,10,26

Multiple managers may dictate different tasks for you to do. Working in the back was pretty fun. There was a lot of horseplay and goofing off, but be careful no to be spotted by managers. Expectations are generally way to high especially with the high turn over and lack of workers.

I love working with my co-workers and helping the customers. I love the fact that everyday is not the same even though the task maybe.

Now sometimes management would send an associate from inside the store to help out if it got too busy, with carts filling up everywhere outside & the inside a lot of carts used by customers. I liked most of the people I worked with though. The position after a while can be physically tasking, especially in the summer time.

Productive Company with Advancement opputunities,"Walmart is a mainstay with advancement oppurtunities all throughout the company. The workplace culture is one of postive, exciting growth.. The management styles are second to none.",5,Former Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Greensboro, NC 27407",10/26/18,2018,10,26
Wonderful Co-Workers/ Watch out for poor managed stores,"During my time in the pharmacy I had the best time with my co-workers in the entirety of my working career so far. I miss them dearly and attempt to talk with them frequently. The store manager, not the pharmacy manager, was unfortunately a leftover of a dark time in that stores history. The store in Howell had issues years before I joined with upper management forcing people to work off the clock later in the evenings when most customers weren't around to ""finish stocking the shelves"". Corporate caught wind of it and hit management hard for it, but I still don't know how he kept his job afterwards. By the time I joined he was well and calmed down from the past but if you didn't get along well with his inner circle then you wouldn't be around for long. Fortunately he was escorted out of the store one day when I was behind the counter and the last words we received on the matter was to ""respect his privacy"" and not know why he was forced to leave. By what I've heard of late the place is still doing wonderful except for a lack of help out on the floor, it seems the old habit of upper management is currently biting them for releasing so many people and refusing to rehire them.",4,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Howell, MI",10/26/18,2018,10,26
work advancement,This is a great place to work if you are looking to make a career out of it and try to work your way up in the company.

Don't have your own opinion,"Walmart is a good company to work for if you don't speak your mind or question policies. When I worked at Walmart, I got strep throat. I asked for several days off so that I could deal with being sick. I even went to a doctor and got a doctor's note confirming the strep throat. Then I handed the paperwork to the right poeple in personal. When I got over being sick I went back to work and I was terminated from my job the same day I went back to work.",5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Colorado Springs, CO",10/26/18,2018,10,26
"Good benefits, bad management.",Depending on the position every day was the same. The environment was stressful and chaotic even on a slow day.

The associates themselves and the benefits were the highlights of working there.,2,Former Employee,Cap Team 1 ,"Aberdeen, WA",10/26/18,2018,10,26

Workplace,"The most enjoyable part is meeting customers that come in every week. They remember a friendly face and that what makes a great community.

Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy,"Rude, Unhelpful Management,Low Pay and High Turnover. The wal-mart I worked at had a new store manager every three months. That left it opened for the department managers to do whatever they wanted. Including cussing at and belittling the workers. Walmart also will still instruct workers to work off the clock to meet your time goals.

Constant change is not a good thing.,"Things are constantly changing and not always for the better. If something isn't broke then don't fix with it. Policies and procedures change on an almost weekly basis and it is very difficult to execute and keep the employees up to date and on board. Most of the management training is irrelevant, as well as the actual employee training,and it is pretty much a sink or swim mentality once you are in position in your store. You are not truly empowered to control your areas and are subject to your store manager's whims. A lot of the people are great but there is a very dog eat dog mentality that is very counter productive to any kind of serious team building between management.",2,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Parma, OH",10/25/18,2018,10,25
Don't do it,"Only work at walmart if you don't mind customers being rude, bossy, or wanting to complain you don't know how to do your job. It was an okay position, but the company wants you to do so much. You don't get paid enough, and if you're part-time you get no benefits. Almost everyone is part-time, there's rarely any full-time positions.",2,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Laredo, TX",10/25/18,2018,10,25
Bad management,"I feel like I was tricked into taking a promotion. When I voiced my concern about not being ready for the promotion the previous DM told me I knew what I needed to know to do the job. She was wrong, and after she left I realized that I knew nothing. It felt like everyday I leaned I was doing something wrong, or not doing a task was supposed to be doing. The store manager doesn't care at all about the fresh departments.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"San Jose, CA",10/25/18,2018,10,25
Fun workplace,Walmart employees really treat you like family and there is never a dial moment working at Walmart. What Walmart has taught me is to have patience and to work hard to your best ability. Most of the managers are understanding and work with you as far as hours go. The hardest part of working at Walmart is having rude customers from time to time and knowing how to handle or deal with them. However; some of the most enjoyable moments are also made by the customers as well. A smile can also brighten up a person's day especially if they are feeling down.,4,Former Employee,Electronic Sales Associate ,"Greenville, SC",10/25/18,2018,10,25

Lack of flexibilty,"I really enjoy my job due to meeting new people every day and that im constantly busy but, the management at some locations is very poor. Sometimes they forget about you and leave you isolated when you need a break. There's never enough staff, the scheduling system isn't reliable. And the point system is a little unfair due to some peoples lives. Alot of people loose thier jobs because of the point systems especially new hires. I asked to transfer due to moving away from the area and the store manager denied me despite of my situation now making my life a little harder.",2,Current Employee,Walmart Supercenter ,"Omaha, NE",10/25/18,2018,10,25

They were unable to accommodate, so i had to leave.

A fair amount of people have short fuses when it comes to shopping, so when one little thing is not to their liking, they find the closest worker and get mad at them.

"It was a job, not a career","Being Walmart, it is not really meant to be a career; rather, a stepping stone. If you really wanted to, you do have the option to work your way up into management and beyond after years as an associate, but that wasn't my intention. Co workers in electronics were phenomenal, and I am still good friend with some almost 2 years after quitting to pursue other options. Management really depends on which manager is over your portion of the store. My first manager was awesome and she kept things running great, but after a switch, my second manager was pretty sloppy and he let our departments fall apart. Pay was $10 to start, but has since been raised to 11 or 12. Not bad for people who just need a short term job, but I advise against trying to make a career out of it unless retail management is your calling.",3,Former Employee,ELECTRONICS ASSOCIATE ,"Lewisburg, TN",10/23/18,2018,10,23

On the average the crew size was 20 a night. when i started working, i was working 40 hrs a week and this went on for about 6 months until i mentioned to H.R. that California law states that any part time worker working 6weeks straight full time hours, they automatically become full time employees and get the benefits. I never saw 40 hrs again, All this started after my six month review which was one of the top scores in a long time. with in two months after, I was taking charge when I did worked and the other employees started listening to me when they had work related problems. I would resolve the issues and tell them how to do the work faster and safer and not get the managers involve. The managers for that reason, started to see me as someone that can actually replace them. I requested to take the managers test and move up and clean up the bad management seeds.

Lack of hours,"I've worked at Walmart for about five months and sadly, they cut my hours. This is the reason I am choosing to leave.

I was then told I couldn't have more hours because there were no more and they needed to give hours for their full time employees more...",3,Former Employee,Cashier and Door Greeter ,"League City, TX",10/22/18,2018,10,22
"Love working with customers. Management, no so much.","The customers and my fellow hourly associates kept me coming back. However, cashiers are a dying breed. They feel self checkouts are better and more cost efficient. Customers tell me "" I don't get paid to scan my items, you do. I'll never use those machines"" And more and more positions are being done away with. So moving up in the company WAS my idea upon my hire date. But the longer i was employed, the less interested I became in moving up. And the more i realized, that Wal-Mart is now all about Business, and not their associates (who are the gears that make the company what they are). I loved my store manager and only a couple managers had a bad attitude. Their bad attitude came from being overloaded with tasks as they continue to cut positions. I was loyal to Wal-Mart, untill Wal-Mart showed me they were not loyal to me. And that when it comes down to it, even if you are the best in your store and work harder then everyone else, to Home Office, you are just a number. Now that Sam Walton has passed, all the morals that came with him, have left Wal-Mart.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Roseburg, OR",10/22/18,2018,10,22

Walmart DSD Receving Associate,"A typical day is fairly fast paced with always something to do, most vendors are nice people as long as you are friendly as well. What I learned was how to stay organized under stress and valuable communication skills between a large number of people. My managers generally stayed out of my area, which was nice because nothing is worse than having a manager micro manage you when they do not know how to do your job. Workplace culture was fairly relaxed, I was able to joke around most days and enjoy my job as much as you can expect to. The hardest part is being overwhelmed by the sheer number of vendors or paperwork if you are not organized. The most enjoyable part of my days were interacting with my coworkers and vendors/merchandisers.",2,Current Employee,Direct Freight/DSD Receiving Associate ,"Marquette County, MI",10/22/18,2018,10,22

It's really a stressful environment to work in,"In my experience, people were expected to do far more than they should have been because the company failed to hire enough employees to properly staff the shifts. Many times the day employees failed to get their required work completed and the task ended up being added to the night employees who already had more than their share to do because of poor ordering by the managers of the departments. While I was there they implemented a few different systems to solve the problems, but as far as I see they are still having the same problems.",3,Former Employee,Mod Team Associate ,"Plymouth, IN",10/22/18,2018,10,22

Lied to from day one.,"They are desperate for people to work there. They will lie to you in order for you to work there about advancement within the company, regular consistant hours and days, and all the overtime you want. Your hours will be consist except the days you work will change constantly, which will wind up making you work 6,7, or 8 days in a row, because they manipulate the pay week schedule. If you go over 8 hours in a day, expect to take a longer break, or be foreced to wait before clocking in. Managers all have nasty attitudes, they are rude and disrespectful and will lie right to your face. The bonus, my share, and shrink program is a scam just to put more money in the Salaried managers wallets. Walmart itself is a horrible company to work for.

Hectic and Unruly,"Unfortunately, Walmart has the tendency to hire less than qualified management, and are very dull on sympathy.

solid place to work depending on your lifestyle,A typical workday is somewhat frustrating at times. I've just learned to mind my own business & try to stay positive no matter what. Management is not up to par as far as talking to associates with respect. The workplace culture is fine never had any issues with that. Hardest part of the job is trying to stay positive with all of the negative energy around.

Negative.,"During the Holidays, or a big event for the area it is extremely busy. Long lines during Black Friday, you have to work on Thanksgiving. The 10% discount, after working there for 3 months, which I don't think that is fair but thats just the policy.  The management was poorly negative, some of them assume they are the CEO's they think they can command, be excessively bossy, or yell at their employers, or they treated the coworkers quite negative. Few management tend to forget just because they have a higher authority, doesn't mean they can treat people who are below them in a negative format. From my experience working there had its pros and cons, I disliked how some supervisors treated me they were brutal, or they would yell at me, or they would state things that were rude. When I got fired, they were not professional about it they were very harsh. I don't deserve to be treated in a disrespectful format, just because you got a higher position doesn't give them the authority to hurt people. Management was horrible. I am happy I got fired.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Sunnyside, WA",10/20/18,2018,10,20

Due to this, employees are always stressed out, as they are doing twice the work to keep this store running. The pay is okay, the employees very from person to person, I've made great friends here.

Worst Managment and Taken Advantage of,"Very unorganized managment team.

It could be hectic at times, but the enjoyment that I got from helping customers was very satisfying. Management could be a pain at times, but for the most part when you were able to get your job done, they left you alone.

I learned a lot of things that helped me take care of myself and satisfy the customers. Management is good, they tell us what to do and know how to help out when we were stuck on what to do. Hardest part of the job was the amount of staffs we'd have. So we'd have to learn almost everything around the store just to keep the store going. And getting overwhelmed by customers when you're alone. Aside from the hard parts, things were easy to learn and everyone there was very friendly and understandable. I love everyone I work with here.",3,Current Employee,"Former CAP2 Associate, Current ACC Sales Associate ","Woodbury, MN",10/19/18,2018,10,19
Not worth it as a starter job,The management was awful and no matter how many complaints you made to home office it never changed. Retaliation was a big problem but again was never handled.

It would be a great place to work if there enough associates and management actually listened to you.,"Walmart could be a great place to work if the culture changed. Management there do not listen very well and are not very good at coming up with solutions to problems. We have been severely understaffed over time of months with very little solution to the problem. On top of that, the freight or other parts of the job are not slowing down, they are only getting worse. But our management team does not seem to get that, and will just yell at you if things don't get done the right way, even though we are not even at capacity to handle all that it takes to keep a store running. This job is very stressful and takes a toll on me too much so that I am looking for a new outlet. I cannot take it just working live freight all day with nothing else getting done when we have no associates and then have all the problems build up and then explode and get questions from my supervisor about these problems aren't getting resolved. My answer is with an obvious question: you wonder why...?! I can't work for a store when we don't have the management team who can run the store and proactively find ways to accommodate the situation without them threatening to coach us or other disciplinary action even thought the situation was created because they are not ensuring a good workplace where people actually want to work.",3,Current Employee,DEPARTMENT MANAGER OF FOODS ,"Bennington, VT",10/19/18,2018,10,19

Not worth breaking your body,"Often given work for more than one person, pressured to stay longer to get the job done, but required to take that time off at a later date within the week.

They look down on you and belittle you constantly. Every now and then you will have a ray of sunshine who has been where you are. The best part was how fast the hours go by on busy days (usually beginning of month). Sometimes they will provide lunch for you especially around holidays.

Poor management and high turn over rates,"Walmart's management put more focus on retaining numbers than hiring long term workers. Though some individuals remained in a position for an extended period of time, many times they had little to no advancement, and miniscule pay raise to compensate loyalty. Individuals with high work ethic and consistency were not rewarded, but individuals failing to meet quotas were only minorly punished, and their extra work inevitably foisted onto another team member that was more capable.",2,Former Employee,Back end stock team member ,"Painted Post, NY",10/19/18,2018,10,19
Fast-paced Yet Stressful,"What I learned: what I learned is that I am extremely well when it comes to multitasking in fitting rooms, as well as being super bubbly at the registers. As well as knowing not every customer can find what they want. I personally think that Wal-Mart has to many people in management, due to an incident I had while working where I was doing my job and the one person in management said to go fix the baby section, as soon as I go over to clean up the area and fix it, another person from management said why are you here go back. It's extremely difficult having more than 2 or 3 people that are managers. When it comes yo department managers they are amazing. They tell you what yo do what needs to be done in order and says everything you need to do in a quick 3 minute conversation. The hardest part of the job: I would think the hardest part of the job would be when you are cross trained and you have so much to do in your section of the store and your on a timed dead line, and then they call for you to help on cash registers._x000D_I think the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be knowing that you helped a customer find what they needed and they got to leave happy and with a smile.",5,Former Employee,Sales Associate / Cashier ,"Sevierville, TN",10/18/18,2018,10,18

Pays well but leaves much to be desired in management,"Overall Walmart as an employer offers relatively decent benefits and ability to move up within the company. The issues I have had are that the management team does not get treated well and in turn treats those below them somewhat poorly as well. My time as a supervisor was spent trying to break this mold only to have it negatively affect my mental health. I would also scrutinize the level of expectation from those above you as they tend to contradict themselves in their expectations. Promoting within was also an issue as it seemed that they made poor promotion decisions, and blamed it on the associate(s) rather than themselves. The health insurance options are decent as well, though if you aren't a long time employee or full-time, which they seem to be slowly edging out as a possibility for new hires, you don't qualify for it. There are also no incentives to work harder or faster than other associates because management does not hold poor work from poor associates in account.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Edinboro, PA",10/18/18,2018,10,18

Has gotten more terrible.,"I just finished a second stint with Walmart and I believe the company has gotten worse since the first time I was hired with them. I was a former store co-manager with the company and a former store manager with a different company. None of that was taken into account when I was hired. I was given a part tome position with horrible pay. There is literally no job  advancement opportunities unless you suck up to whatever current manager is running the store. When I applied for an assistant manager opportunity, I was told by the store manager that I didn’t have enough experience leading a team. I informed him of my past positions, but he said I didn’t have current experience. All of their current assistant managers are kids with very little to no experience, the stores are completely understaffed, and they are currently trying to get full time associates to step to part time by reducing hours. I assume to cut benefits. Overall a horrible atmospherre, and a terrible working environment.",2,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,"Old Saybrook, CT",10/18/18,2018,10,18

Okay work enviornment(: Just not a good fit,"The work enviornment is okay. The management wasn't horrible if you're having a good day, but sometimes if you were coming in and your day was already horrible, they made it worst. So for example, if you were having a bad day already don't go to management because they weren't doing their job. That's just in my opinion, but sometimes I don't feel like some people need to be a manager, just simply because if you can't do your job step down and let someone else worthy do it, don't just hand the problem to another ""higher up"" management who still won't solve the initial problem. That's why I left, not because I'm stupid, etc. But because you should let business be business, and that job was too stressful, so here I am online!

Great opportunities unless you get sick or have children who gt sick.,"I devoted my life to Walmart in the beginning two years of employment. It cost my health and eventually my job, all of my insurance and stress caused more health problems. I was harassed by new managers that I had helped to train. Eventually I was disrespected and threatened by other managers for not being a part of the group to punish and push people that they did not like. Once you ever get a health issue and need an FMLA leave you become a target for termination. Sad but very true.

Worse Motivating Job Ever,"I have been with Walmart on and off for 7 years, and have continually returned because I knew it was an easy job to get that would not be minimum wage. Before the recent restructure of Walmart's management and positions, I would tell anyone who asked or who was in need of a job to apply, because it wasn't a bad job day to day, but since my respect and dedication to the company has completely diminished. Walmart has demoted thousands by liquidating positions, forcing many who already live check to check to take a pay cut. Several associates were forced to even search for a new job because of the changes. Those who remained were the privileged favorites hand-picked without interviewing of the store manager and market manager, and those who were left to break our backs forced to work harder and harder than the day before. If you have no hopes to move up and work harder and harder due to being shorthanded and not having the equipment to do your job, then this isn't a bad job. But if you have ambition, ideas, or integrity, this is not the job you want.",3,Current Employee,4 to 1 Stocker ,"Broken Arrow, OK",10/17/18,2018,10,17
Stable job,"I've been fortunate to have good managers. That isn't always the case for others I've spoken too. Walmart isn't a bad place to work but the hourly wage isn't enough for a single, adult person or a single income family. Neither is it enough for certain positions.  The work is physical, busy and expectations are generally high.  Walmart does encourage it's employees to strive for higher positions, however, it's not always possible in the store where you begin working....usually need to be open to and willing to change store location to do so. And again, pay isn't a true compensation for the work expected of lower management positions.",4,Current Employee,Online Grocery ,"Plano, TX 75024",10/17/18,2018,10,17

Company tendencies,The company causes it's own problems. Store salary management is push to be available 24/7 even on vacation and off time.

awful,not exactly the place where you'd find a career at least not in this day and age. maybe 20 years ago this was a great company to work for and had many opportunities for promotion but now its brought down to the level where its a side job for high school kids who just got out of school for summer break.

What I learned,"Large corporations like Walmart function as a bridge or stepping stone for many entry level workers.  It is not a workplace culture for the faint of heart.

If they are unable to take a direct order they need to go elsewhere._x000D__x000D_If an employee can think on their feet, be self directed and keep their opinions to themselves they can survive the culture at Walmart._x000D__x000D_I am asked to write more about Walmart.

Honest truth,"Working here at the beginning was great! Everyone that started had an amazing oppotnutiy to travel out for training for a month. We came back and started off the FC in Davenport,Fl. _x000D_Everyone enjoyed coming in to work. Better yet enjoying  3 consecutive days off: Sat, Sun &Mon or 4 days off if you worked weekends : Tues-Friday. The start pay at the time was better than most warehouses around. $13.00/hr and a .50 cent raise every 6 months until you capped out to $15.They have quarterly incentive, which maxed out to an additional $2,000 a year on your pay check. _x000D_Their attendance policy is stricter than most companies. We couldn’t use our PTO the way we wanted to. If we came in late or left early that would be a write-up.

Everything they do gets sweept under  the rug and a nice promotion if given to them. So much for there one of their core value: INTERGRITY. Manager’s kids get promoted without any hesitation.

A typical day at work can be hectic.,Multiple managers giving instructions can be confusing. We get hot dogs and donuts when we do well. There is a wide variety of people that work here that can be friendly. Customers are very interesting when shopping they ask a variety of questions and tell interesting stories.,3,Current Employee,Second shift stocker ,"O'Fallon, MO",10/13/18,2018,10,13

Atmosphere of Cronyism,"The company for the most part is the same as most large retail chains. Stressful environment with little recognition unless you put yourself out there for management, regardless of the amount of work performed. Promotions more often occurred without interviews, instead going to an individual pre-selected by management. Often, more qualified applicants were not considered due to manager preference many times based on the personal rapport with the decision maker. Turnover among salary management was high as well, resulting in associates needing to adjust to a new style every few months or so. Toward the end of my time there it was admittedly getting better but by then many of those I had worked with the entire time I worked there had already become unsatisfied with their careers, including several of the salary managers.",3,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Denton, TX",10/12/18,2018,10,12
Don’t do it unless your ready to kiss butt,Not people friendly the management thinks their better than people can’t voice your opinion and it’s like a high school super MESSY.

Place is toxic,"Some good people. Mostly not good people. The place basically operates like a high school. Just make friends with managers who think they are the cool kids and you get promoted. The managers will seriously mock and make fun of you behind your back and to your face. Unless you suck up to one of them, you are just a number. I have never had a manager give a hoot about me in that place. You can't even bring an idea up with them because they look down on you for not being a manager. Some problem solvers are rude and not good at their jobs. The same goes for leads. Terrible place to work. They also tend to hire anyone with a warm body so it is frustrating for the good workers to work with the incompetent. _x000D__x000D_Oh and now they are opening up a new building across the street and not letting anyone in the old building get promoted in that one.",2,Current Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Pedricktown, NJ",10/12/18,2018,10,12
A good job but no future,Not a bad place to work but  you cannot survive on the pay.  For the most part it is a come in and do your job.  There is little accountability though for those who don't work.,4,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Albuquerque, NM",10/12/18,2018,10,12
Company transition in the years and not a good place to work,The company changed over time and all the management was concerned with is the dollar. There was limited support from upper management and expected to do the impossible with limited resources. It became a company that did not care about the associate.,3,Former Employee,Store Director ,OK,10/12/18,2018,10,12

Management is scared of their own shadow,"Management is scared to hold people accountable for their actions, or inactions, that hinders the store as a whole. They need to stand firm with everyone on an equal level, and not let one get away with murder while jumping down another's throat for the smallest of hiccups. Also, they need to have an alternative planned out when they forbid a plan of action that has been in place up until the point that employees are told to stop. You can't just say, ""Hey you can't do it this way anymore."", without a another way of handling the issues that will arise. You pretty much leave them in-between a rock and a hard place. Also, you can't get mad at the outcome because employees take initiative to come up with a solution when you didn't have one in place already.",3,Current Employee,Modular Team Member ,"Gadsden, AL",10/12/18,2018,10,12

I worked at a Wal-mart DC.,"I worked as much as 15 hours per day, 22 hours being my longest day and was salary.  Areas competed with each other and I would be very cutthroat.  I did learn to roll with quick changes and make decisions the could cost thousands of dollars.  Employees were never happy ever though they were paid well for our area.  Call-offs were horrible, about 15% each day",2,Former Employee,Warehouse Employee ,"Woodland, PA",10/12/18,2018,10,12

Quick paced and very routined,Wal-Mart gives you a very specific routine to follow. You will learn the different position you are put in and are usually cross trained to other positions as well. The hourly associates are kind and care for one another. The major down side is the management can over micro manage but will ask if there are any problems. The hardest part of the job is when one routine fails then all the others do as well. I have personally enjoyed the co workers and getting to know them.,3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Wesley Chapel, FL",10/12/18,2018,10,12
"it was always busy, the co workers were always friendly, overall it was a pretty good work environment","when I worked at Wal Mart everyone was always smiling, they were never mean to me everyone was friendly.

Management,"The store I currently work for has a staff that is constantly changing . Open door is not used as often as it should be in fear of retaliation. Communication is not guaranteed among management and associates. Communication is not Guaranteed between management and management. For a company whose employees need to work together to be successful,  it feels like there are many cliques and many people not held accountable for their actions. There are many good department manager that are fed up with the whole system and are wanting to walk,the only reason they don’t walk is because they need a paycheck.",2,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Hampstead, MD",10/12/18,2018,10,12

Pretty nice,It’s a fairly easy job when you add in all the added benifits. Easy to move up and it definitely pays off. Most enjoyable part of the day is usually first thing in the morning when the store is empty. I’ve learned it’s easier to just take everything one day at a time.
