Managers are terrible,I worked at the Sparkman location and management was awful. Rude for no reason and just disrespectful. My supervisor had me greet customers at the door because she was too lazy to train me and when I said something about it she put me on the door even more as a punishment.

"Bad management, bad culture","I worked at Walmart for 2 months. During my time there, I learned just how horribly it was managed. Most days, I wasn’t sure what job I was going to be doing. Some of the jobs they had me do would be paid a dollar higher if that was my actual position. So I was getting paid less money to do some jobs. I had several instances when I needed support from a CSS or Manager and I would be waiting 10+ minutes each time. One time, I had a customer cuss me out and get in my space and there was no support to be seen. Another time, I was on the register for 6 hours without a break and when I asked for my break, the CSS cussed at me and told me to leave for my break.

probably the fastest way to get burnt out with retail,"Very first job, so I was rather desperate, and this place was always hiring. starting wage was admittedly higher than local businesses, but aside from the $0.23 yearly wage increase, there wasn't much of a reward for staying with them.

Working at Walmart is a good experience to have.,I worked at Walmart for an interim amount of time. The things I learned there were very valuable in terms of being able to communicate and help in a team. A typical day would look very busy but everyone would be working hard. Management was the most interesting part some days it would be a rollercoaster other days it was more peaceful. The hardest part of the job was the position I was in. My co-workers would often not show up to work or leave in the middle of a shift. The most enjoyable part is being able to push carts quickly and fast.,3,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Phoenix, AZ",5/31/20,2020,5,31

Georgia in general is all BS. Assistant managers are all just workers that fill in when associates call out. They call out because of the sheer amount of freight to be turned. In the end china bought the waltons shares so good luch staying more than a few years.

They are not too flexible but expect YOUR schedule to be flexible meaning they schedule you even when you aren't supposed to be.Then if you don't see it, on the schedule(I guess your supposed to be checking the schedule 24/7 on your phone), you get a point.

Typical Corporate nonsense.,"There’s a reason this company has a 70% turnover rate. It’s not the worst place in the world to work as long as you’re willing to accept poor benefits, unpredictable hours, and poor management.

It’s actually kind of comedic to watch them snub a long time employee on a promotion for someone off the street.",2,Current Employee,Maintenance Technician ,"Opelika, AL",5/21/20,2020,5,21
Awful,"Walmart is an awful place to work at, I worked as an apparel associate with seven other women in the department. Mind you, our apparel department was HUGE, and we’d often have call ins, anytime that happened management would never help out. Management would have me pick up the slack, when I was ALREADY being overworked. A lot of times I was being asked to finish zoning and then finish putting back CARTS of returns. I never had time to finish both tasks. Not to mention, we were asked to zone a DIFFERENT department for 30 minutes to an hour, as if apparel doesn’t have enough on our hands._x000D_Making $11 an hour was not worth it, even if that’s the most I’d ever made at the time._x000D_When expressing my concerns to management, I was dismissed and brushed off, telling me I was being lazy.

Low pay for miles on your feet,"We get paid the same as all other employees. The job is harder than any position. Due to manually lifting and transporting bins.

good pay but the culture was not very good,"I hate to admit that the only good thing about the Wal-Mart Distribution Center in Searcy AR was the pay. The management team was horrible and everyone seemed to blame everyone else in order to not be wrote up. Associate's jobs are constantly on the line and management is quick to remind everyone of this. I worked there almost 10 years and I would not go back if they tripled the pay. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the rules and the the management team, they both seemed to change every week.

Good luck trying to move up or even move into a different department, unless you are a manager favorite you're not going anywhere even then its 50/50. Management promises aren't worth anything, communication is very poor, rumors spread like wildfire and the amount of work you're expected to do compared to pay is insane.

Almost complete lack of communication,"While this is a great company to get you started out on your carrer, you will quickly realize that there is alot wrong with it. Number one being the almost complete lack of communication; 3/10 days they will have a schedule on the wall telling you what to do (admittedly, they've been getting better at this), but, for those other 7 days you have to randomly guess what you're supposed to stock and stock those items until a manager comes and gives you a talking to because you're wasting shift time on a job you weren't supposed to be doing that day. It's been especially apparent with Covid-19, where they don't report the number of people infected in a store unless you are in that position, thus making it difficult to know how dangerous working there actually is. Number two is unrealistic expectations; every retailer is guilty of expecting too much out of an employee, as a 16 year-old, they expect me to be able to take down a 9-foot tall pallet mainly consisting of: pasta sauce, mac and cheese, and peanut butter (Which all go in different aisles, by the way) in a grand total of 45 minutes to an hour, which is near impossible to do in a team, never mind when you're by yourself.

Horrible place to work,"One of the worst places to work. Under paid, under staffed, and very horribly maintained.

Managers are really disrespectful,"Managers dont do their job they hide in the back office and only come out when they are called for. The rest of the staff seemed ok but you cant trust anyone they all run and talk behind your back making things hard. The front end manager drew told me to quit just because i put in my 2 week notice for a better job he told me to judt turn my stuff in snd leave, i did then he sent me papers in the mail saying i had abandoned my job and that i was fired but i only did what he said",1,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Indiana, PA",5/19/20,2020,5,19
Too much bureaucracy and shadiness,"A typical day at the distribution center was making sure to clock in at exactly the time you were scheduled. If you clocked in 5 minutes early or 5 minutes after, you were docked. I worked overnights from 5 pm to 5 am. The schedule was really nice, in that I only had to work 3 days a week. I learned how to conduct quality assurance for warehousing distribution and how to manage orders for the warehouse. The workplace culture was very questionable. Towards the end of my employment, workers were barely putting in any effort just to be able to get the hours they needed because either the company was trying to cut  hours or the volume just wasn't there. The hardest part of the job was trying to get clarification on company policies and employee benefits. While this information was pushed down through management, it seemed as though some managers were ill informed or there was no commonality in their knowledge of such matters. The most enjoyable part of the job was having 4 days off during the week. Overall, it's a good place to work for competitive pay, however, there is a lot of baggage that goes along with it.",2,Former Employee,Systems Operator ,"Gordonsville, VA",5/19/20,2020,5,19

Experiences can vary widely based off of your store manger or assistant manger.,"Mostly if you come in and do your job you're fine.

decent place,"At Walmart the job was pretty direct. If you needed help, it would take a little bit, but eventually your supervisor made their way and helped you.

If you need help they will not be the one to do it, management only likes senior employees, if you're new your word does not mean anything.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Marshall, MO",5/18/20,2020,5,18
This store couldn't follow one best way if it's life depended on it,"The store is worked by people who have perfected the term ""cutting corners.""  The customers are rude, the associates are ok, but the managers lack in professionalism as well as basic communication skills. The only time they will actually work is when someone higher up in the chain visits the store. I have had to do a lot of things that the company states is ""against policy"" for the protection of ""the worker"". They claim to have an ethics group that looks into protecting the workers, but those issues are still left to be investigated by the store manager. Which is just pointless. It depends on which store you work at to be honest. Make the most out of each day if you choose to work for this company.",2,Current Employee,Associate ,"Temple, TX",5/18/20,2020,5,18

Worst place ever,"As a overnight stocker, it’s obvious any type of manger could care less about you as a person. All that is cared about is stocking the whole store as fast as you can your whole shift. And its expected to be finish no matter if there is 5 people working or 10. Being threatened about your job and talked down to by management every night is unbelievable and emotionally exhausting. To add all your coworkers do not join in on the teamwork and snitch on everything you do.",1,Current Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Porter Heights, TX",5/18/20,2020,5,18
Walmart,"Walmart to me personally, was a pretty decent job. The store I personally worked at(Taylorville, IL) the managers were all pretty cool for the most part.

Overall the job was very easy but there was no excitement towards going in for work and some of the managers would act disrespectful at times,"Working at Walmart wasn’t the worst or best job and I say that because the work was very simple and easy, but it was very boring and most of the managers were disrespectful or would abuse their power.",2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Joliet, IL",5/18/20,2020,5,18
They actually pay well in upper management,"Worked for the company 21 years, I moved up to lower management fairly quickly and the money was good as I moved up. As much as I am thankful that I worked with Walmart and they paid my bills for so long there are things of course that could have been better in upper management. The hours are long on to many occasions especially if company is coming to visit and you are a ASM or higher in management but again the pay is high in those positions. Overall except for the long hours and the canceling vacations I would do it all over again. A huge perk is you can move around fairly easy due to the 3000 stores plus and the every day people you get to meet and spend time with. Hope this helps.",3,Former Employee,Co Mgr Walmart ,"Garland, TX",5/18/20,2020,5,18

Job,Walmart is a starter job. Anyone can get hired and anyone can move up in the company (just depends on who you know really.)

Horrible! Prospective hires beware!,"I worked briefly as an asset protection associate during the pandemic, and had to quit because of the emotional and physical toll it was taking on me. Asset protection employees usually keep people from shoplifting, but due to the virus you are now expected to stand outside in the heat for hours counting people as they come in and out. Not only is it extremely monotonous, it is very physically taxing. I often felt like I was going to pass out from the heat and dehydration. You are also subject to a lot of abuse from customers, ranging from being insulted to being threatened with violence. If they don’t have you outside, you’re inside sanitizing the carts and have to wear a 30 pound backpack full of sanitizer that you aren’t allowed to take off for your entire shift.

'Some days are better than others' (typical response)... Management can give attitude when not needed. When asked to help out in other areas of the store or wanting to expand my knowledge of the store I always am the go-to person. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with rude customers and rude Managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around my coworkers and likable and caring customers.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Garden Grove, CA",5/14/20,2020,5,14
None productive,"They change their policy many times, to fit their needs and customers needs only. They company and managers do not value employees unless that employee follows everything to a T. The customer service manages or ""team Leaders"" do not trust employees at all, and on occasion the mangers, if problems arise with customers. They let customers verbally abuse and almost physical abuse to the employees. You must work weekends and be available to work nights. You must give three weeks in advance to get days off, and that's not a guarantee either. Must work Thanksgiving day and black Friday events that happen on Thanksgiving night and on Friday as well, to get their coupon of 15% along with your normal discount of %10. The bonuses use to be based on shrinkage and little on attendance. But now its based on attendance and if you have 4 points, you don't get anything. I find that its unfair on how they treat employees. They say they are family friendly, but when they put customers over employees, especially during confrontations, they aren't.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Self-Checkout Host ,"Nampa, ID",5/14/20,2020,5,14

Challening work but decent pay,"I worked in Grocery Pick Up {Personal Shopper} when it first started. Since it was new no one really knew what to expect and how to really handle difficulties. Things were always changing so if you had a couple of days off things could be totally different when you returned to work.

Last time I had to retake a Management test I aced three times previously. Answered it the same as the previous times and managed to somehow pass and fail at the same time.

Never enough employees!,"I worked as a cashier. There are NEVER enough cashiers working front end. Sometimes I don't even get to go on breaks! The customers are incredibly rude as well. When you become a cashier at Walmart you become every customer's punching bag. Price differences because someone stocked in items in the wrong area? Well, tough luck, that becomes your fault and you get cursed at for it. Manager or CEO enforced a new policy that the customer doesn't like? Also becomes your fault. Not enough items in stock? Again, you get the blame. Not enough people working? You get the blame even though you're not the person that does the hiring, makes the schedule, or stocks the store! The only thing I liked about working at Walmart were my coworkers, they were amazing.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,Merced,5/9/20,2020,5,9

Poor leadership,"Was a pharmacist there for 4 years. Actually stepped down from management because their expectations were ridiculous.

As an external hire, I was assured that from day one I would be taken care of from onboarding to training. However, after what I consider to be the most unorthodox onboarding I have ever experienced I was caught in limbo due to upper management, there was minimal direction and I felt out of place. I was disappointed as I thought I could spend the rest of my career at Walmart.

It is a soul sucking place to work.,You are surrounded by people who will go out of their way to make you look bad so they look good and management encourages this. The bottom line is all that matters is money to them. Yo are a number nothing more. Managers often simply call to you in a hey you rather than you name. The reason that Walmart gets more than it's fair share of wacco customers is because that care more about the money in their pockets than employees respect or safety.

Adding to this, no matter how many full-timers quit, they would hire 2-3 more part-timers instead of making someone else a full-timer._x000D__x000D_The most dreadful thing about the job is that there was mostly nothing tl do; sure about twice a week there would be something major that you could finish in like an hour or two, but normally there would be very few customers and no work to do during the day._x000D__x000D_So many negatives to this job, the only positive is the starting wage that ultimately doesn’t matter much because there are no hours given.",1,Former Employee,Photo/Electronics Associate ,"Graham, TX",5/7/20,2020,5,7

Depends on the department you’re in.,"I’ve worked several departments in Walmart, some were very frustrating, however if you have an opportunity to work in the pharmacy I highly recommend it.

Boring and easy,"I worked in CAP2, so I unloaded the truck and stocked shelves. The job was really easy and my coworkers made it enjoyable. About half of management acknowledged our existence and were nice to us. I definitely got the impression that most of the store blamed CAP 2 for their problems so we didn't interact that much with other parts of the store. Be aware that the bonuses they tell you about are dependent on how much your store makes, so if you work at a small store like I did, the quarterly bonus, assuming you get one will be small (mine was less than $30 and my supervisor's was less than $100) even though when I got hired I was told it would be like a bonus paycheck. I was sick of being lied to by the managers so I left, but it really wasn't a bad job.",4,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Fort Collins, CO",5/2/20,2020,5,2

"Good Entry-Level Work, Not a long-term career","I worked as a CAP 2 associate. The job is relatively easy to learn, each day was the same. The repetition helps you get used to things, and that was my personal favorite part of the job. You unload the loose loaded truck, stock the grocery items, and then a secondary truck comes that also must be worked. The hardest part of the job is keeping up on days where it is understaffed. On a good day where everyone shows up and there are enough people on the schedule, you can get your job done and then some. On a bad day when there are multiple call-offs and nobody on the schedule, it can be difficult to meet expectations. Unfortunately, management isn't always concerned with what's going on in the back of the store, so the team and their supervisor are often left to their own devices. This gives the team some independence, but it's hard to get help when the team needs it, too. There is a high turn over rate, upper management knows this and treats people as such. Because of this, supervisors are reluctantly forced to lean on their better performing associates. This  means good workers are overworked and bad workers are tolerated until they quit or can be replaced. Like any job, there are a few coworkers and managers that can be relied upon, and you'll find yourself going to the same people for help, feedback, and guidance. Overall a middle-of-the-road, typical big-box store environment.",2,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Coal Township, PA",5/1/20,2020,5,1

Restock s2,for  enough you will end up with the heaviest packages limiting the amount you can actually do to the lowest hardest amount. Work distribution is not fair at all and no one regulates it in any way. They  encourage you to “get in there” and get some work but while getting in there a box has been dropped on my head feet and hit with a cart. We stand there for aproximately 60% of our 11 hour shift posting another review so I can get it all on there that no one has work. During those times you are not allowed to sit in any way shape or form and are expected to “keep “busy by cleaning sweeping or going to the 4 level work spots to scavenge for work in wich there are a total of 120 people also waiting for work. Yes the two 20 minutes breaks are paid but it’s chAos after going through lines of metal detectors and searches to leave for break you can only leave on the dot of let’s say 10:00 pm by the time you enter the break room or lounge it’s now 10:03 after being on your feet on concrete for hours you can sit until 10:28 then they call you back 2-3 minutes before the 20 is us to ensure you are back working by the time the 20 minutes is up. Not enough break time at all for a physically demanding job. It’s super hot they say tempt regulated but in the tower it’s only 4 flans per floor on the corners only so the middle is dead hot. Not all of the “water stations work so you have to go clear across the warehouse to get water sometimes.

I rose through the ranks quickly and as you get further into management the corporate messaging of how they want their culture to be and how they want their employees to be treated did not match the reality of the day to day. You'll make a promise to an employee about hours being set, or more hours being available if sales in their department do well, but assigning payroll never matched that promise. Employees were retaliated against for taking sick time. Pay raises are non existent or a joke.

Walmart is somewhere that is a good temporary job unless you start off as a manager or you want to have a long term career at Walmart.,"Walmart was a good temporary job. The pay was good but as an 18-year-old who had just graduated high school and had college to worry about, the 2-11 workday and at least a 5 day work week just didn't work for me at the time. The management was okay but the managers really could care less about all the employees and it isn't really hard to figure that out, or at least that's how I was treated. I don't really care if my Walmart managers cared for me at all but they treat you like they know so much better than you when they are managers at Walmart.

Only slightly better than CVS & Walgreens,A soul crushing experience. No amount of Walmart sheers or fake enthusiasm can compensate for dirt poor wages. Low prices mean underpaid and overworked employees. It sets managers up to fail by cutting staff. Puts patients at risk by short staffing (mistakes happen when you're rushed & spread thin).

The worst management I have ever worked with.,"I have only been with Walmart a very short time and in all the jobs I have ever worked this company is by far the worst. The management is the worst I have ever encountered. I have never worked for a company where a manager will walk past you and not utter so much as a grunt. Too many managers that are not on the same page. There is no communication between management and staff, you find out the things you need to know to do this job by default.

"It's not difficult, but that doesn't mean it's easy","Working for Walmart is not for everyone.  I admit that I took the job more out of desperation than I did actually wanting to continue working in retail.  If you like working with the public on a daily basis and don't mind customers that can sometimes be rude and condescending, then you should be okay with a job at Walmart._x000D_While managers usually have your back when it comes to the decisions you make, especially when dealing with customers who want to make returns or exchanges that are outside the return policy, that doesn't mean that they will enforce the policy.  More often than not, they are more concerned with keeping customers happy than anything else, but this varies depending on the manager.  If you're someone who appreciates consistency when it comes to decision making and following policies, I don't recommend this position. _x000D_Also, be aware that working at the customer service desk doesn't mean that your only responsibilities will be to help customers with returns, exchanges, and keeping the service area tidy.  Even though most stores have separate Money Services counters, Service Desk associates are asked daily to help with these services, such as money orders, and MoneyGram transactions.

Sets you up for failure,"Every week is worse than the last. There is constantly some new nitpicky policy or rule that is put in place that slows us down or completely prevents us from doing our actual job. We frequently express our frustration to upper management(store/co/assistants) and all we get is some cookie cutter response about teamwork and integrity, all while the issue at hand is entirely ignored. The good workers and supervisors are constantly micromanaged while the bad/lazy workers and sketchy managers can berate people and disappear for hours without consequence. If you are seen as a good worker, you have more petty busywork piled onto you while you are already struggling to get the basic requirements of your job done. Then you'll get fussed at for not getting ALL of it done. Rules apparently don't apply to management. They can tell you to do something against policy to make numbers look good but make a big deal out of if a normal associate were to take a shortcut to actually get done on time. OGP is growing like a cancer and taking over the back rooms and leaving little to no space for the grocery and produce departments. Our requests for help are ignored and berated by upper management, we've been told we have plenty of people on a busy weekend day with 3 people when we need 6 or 7. Corporate is the worst of all, they have impossible expectations and set us up for failure. Then, when we do fail, we are threatened with a chain of write ups. They are unapproachable by any means, we are but peasants to them and our feedback and opinions don't matter.

Horrible Management,"Me and view others from a group show up for Orientation (Day 1)._x000D_We then show up for training (Day 2), there, we are told that I and few others are not populated in the system yet, so they send us home and ask us to come back a few days later._x000D__x000D_(Day3) We do just that, we arrive, only to be told the same thing. Instead, they ask us to go home and wait for their hiring manager to call us once our names have been populated on their system._x000D__x000D_I personally called various times, and I keep getting the same answer. What in the world is going on? Are they so horrible at managing things that they lose important information on employees so they send them home because they cannot proceed with training until they show up on their system?

"Assorted cliques, interspersed by individuals who really tried to emulate Sam Walton's ideas on how to treat people-and employees.","As long as you only do what you are told,and never try to change aberrant behaviors either in the Front End(Cashiers) or in general employees- it's a good job. Walmart will make the investment in schooling and time for whatever position you apply for,if you are accepted. Some of the training modules are somewhat dated- but that's to be expected in an organization this large. Eventually they are updated. The problems are not with the Customers- it's the Supervisors, Managers and a few employees who either leave their responsibilities for the next worker, of Supervisors on power trips that accuse you of ""being disrespectful"" as a catch-all, shut down redirection tool so you can be written up- or ""coached"". I wish this wasn't so, but it is. By example- I have been told by cashiers who have worked there longer than I have, and for that for that reason alone they would not listen when I was tasked to train them on newer equipment. I had been threatened several times by a Bakery employee when she was ringing up goods, incorrectly, on self-checkout machines I was responsible for tending to when I interceded to correct her errors. Several times she assured me that I was going to be fired. I didn't know until months later that she was the daughter of a Cashier Service Manager  who also worked at the store. I trained cashiers that did as they decided to after I walked away. I had one cashier who for nearly a year would not acknowledge my existence because I didn't do what she demanded me to.

Very corporate oriented,You are required to do your job the way they want you to and complete in a timely manner however the way they want you to complete your job is very slow and timely that it is almost impossible to get it done on very busy days because they factor in how long it takes to do something when you have a full crew but you never have a full crew.,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Plymouth, NH",4/15/20,2020,4,15

Its just like any job,"Firstly. I love my position. Its really luck that landed me here. My co workers are fun and friendly. Ive made wonderful friends. I think managment is spotty but where isn't it? My biggest issue is the attendance policy. You have 5 points to use. And if you use any, it will count against you. you will not get your bonus or raise if you have 3+. This isn't right at all. You are punishing people for being sick, family emergencies, car trouble, ect. They give you "" protected PTO"" that you can use to avoid a point. But you will need enough for a shift. And you are lucky to accrue 8 hours of PPTO in a month. It's very frustrating.  It has made alot of employees work less hard.

You will need nerves of steel, especially if you start working here during the COVID-19 pandemic._x000D__x000D_On that note, Walmart as a company has handled the pandemic very poorly. Compared to other retail chains giving their employees hazard pay or letting them stay home, you're allowed merely two weeks off for any COVID-related reason. Any longer and they reserve the right to fire you. Alongside that, employees received a one-time bonus of $150 for part-time or $300 for full-time, but let's face it, most of their employees are coded as part-time despite working upwards of 40 hours a week._x000D__x000D_Walmart has also been one of the slowest chains to limit customers in their store. However, these limits don't matter because they are higher than the amount of customers their stores typically get anyways.

Changes in Store Management caused major problems,Walmart was a great place to work. I was hired by a Manager with 24 yrs of loyalty to the company he also started as a bike assembler & worked his way up to a Store Manager.. This Manager was a realist being employed many years as well as serving in many hourly roles moving into a position which was salaried he was able to honestly watch the deterioration of the company & the work ethic of his employees change over the years. When the Market Manager retired. We were assigned a Market Manager who came in without admitting that particular store is the toughest in the market. It was hard to find good employees & as a result the store suffered from major shortages during the yearly inventory as well as attrition was over 300%. Well needless to say he was demoted & like the Market Manager in comes a new manager who was cold & refuse to except the struggles. Manager s begain transferring & the culture changed from WORSE to WORSEN. She always did a lot of  finger pointing & belitti g her support staff so the turnover in management was a concern. Change in Management hurt morale & commitment at every level.,2,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager- ,"York, PA",4/11/20,2020,4,11

"managers liked to advance people on their own personality likes and dislikes, not how well you worked, or how long you'd been there.","The managers grade work by how well the associate can do what they want done, their way.

This has happened over and over, I saw from years there._x000D_   Managers rarely train you in the job. You are told many, many things, and then thrust into doing it, and if you have it wrong, are treated like a child and given a demerit. But if you are their personal buddy, they ignore the same thing, the other person was chastised for. The job was not that hard, it should not require great speed, yet that is what they wanted to grade on, not keeping the food culled, or presented well, or helping customers find things. The benefits have such a high deductible, you can rarely meet it to get the discounted rate.

Walmart needs to reevaluate their policies.,"The job is fine. I love the people I work with mostly. While working for Walmart in the pharmacy the management did not listen to my concerns. Their attendance policy is 5 points in a rolling 6 month period. What they don't tell you is, if you have 4 points around the end of January when the yearly evaluations are due, you don't get a 2% raise. Even if your actual eval done by your manager was solid performer. For someone who has worked at Walmart for 5 years, I think that is the worst policy they have ever came up with.

Walmart was a pretty good job overall.,While I worked at walmart i had a great experience with the leaders and other workers. Everyone was nice and made sure they helped me if i needed it.

Never work for walmart!!!!,"I worked at Wal-Mart for 8 months. I started out as a maintenance/custodian. They told me i will be promoted to stocking after 3 months. I hated the job after the first week. Managers are unfair and unreasonable, you could work hard  and still never be appreciated. They never cared about their cashiers or anyone. They only cared about the customers and the profits. I would never go back. Managers are mainly the reason why we have so many new associates quit after the first week. I've had lots of issues with management.  I still have anxiety when I walk in to shop. Wal-Mart is a good paying job. But it is not worth dealing with the drama and things. Don't even get me started on the associates. Some of them are always gossiping and spreading rumors. Many people have almost lost their jobs because they can't keep ur name outta their mouths.  I quit my job back in February to work a trade job. Wal-Mart also never cared about ur personalal life or ur career. Ive lost an interview because Wal-Mart didn't let me take that day off. So Wal-Mart throws you under the bus. You could get injured and they will tell you ur fired after you were absent.  After my experience with Wal-Mart. I wanted to let everyone know that Wal-Mart is not a place to work at. I couldn't even take a sick day without being yelled at by my manager. Again, I wouldn't work there at all!!!!!  It was a NIGHTMARE!!!!",2,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Chesapeake, VA",4/5/20,2020,4,5

Not a bad job for first time workers.,"I was very excited to start working for walmart, however my excitement was shot down within a month of working there. I quickly learned that since i had no seniority with the company, that i was disposable in the eyes of management. I was experienced in grocery before working for walmart, so i knew how to do my job well, yet one of the senior members of my team had a personal problem with me, so he constantly slandered my name to management, and since he was a favorite in the eyes of the store manager, she would believe everything he said about me, without actually making her own opinions about me. Management and the senior members of the store team were extremely unprofessional when it came to confrontation, i have no issue being corrected if i make a mistake, but instead i would get insulted more than anything by both management and the senior employee. My job duties weren't bad at all, and i would gladly still work for walmart today if favoritism wasn't a big part of working there.

Poor management,Communication is lacking. The company is all about them and management is poorly. They tell you what you want to hear when you first start and leave out the things you may need or want afterwards. I have had to learn the hard way.

A Mixed Bag,"When I first started at Walmart, I was excited for work and always enjoyed the time there. But over the years I have found changes in the company affecting its associates for the worst. In the stores I worked at, everyone is over-worked, under-paid, and management did not help. I understand they want to hold associates more accountable and have been instructing management to hold back on assisting, but with the number of associates we had there was no way to accomplish every task in the time frame they wanted. So in the end all that happened was they turned good workers into burned-out employees who didn't care and only showed up for a paycheck. _x000D__x000D_I hope my experience was the exception and not the norm. It was an okay job that paid the bills, and I met some wonderful people. At both stores, my coworkers were the best part of the job._x000D__x000D_If I had to return I would, though not at the stores I worked at.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Branson, MO",4/1/20,2020,4,1
"Be prepared to work long, fast, and hard, only to be told you're too slow.","This being my first job, I kept my standards fair. That being said, working at Walmart was a bit of a disorganized mess that mostly hinged on employees who appeared to genuinely not want to be there. At first, I thought this was just because everyone had something else on their mind. Everyone's got something to worry about every now and then. But the further I went on in working, the more it started to dawn on me how the work ethic was like. _x000D__x000D_Despite how they present themselves as, Walmart employees were the most depressed and struggling workers I have ever seen. Most testimonies I've heard were about people who had high energy and gave 110% when they first started, only to discover that the establishment does not actually reward that. In some cases, you are even chastised for it. _x000D__x000D_What mattered was the quota. It did not matter how you completed it, just as long as you completed it, and that nothing broke. That sounds simple enough. However, no matter how well you performed your work, you could still get accused slowing down or being lazy. _x000D__x000D_That being said, I did not dislike the Managers or Assistant Managers. For all I know, they would be going through the same thing. But there was a disconnect between them and Customer Service. They would occasionally punish you for something that was outside of your control. The worst was when harsh criticism was used as a substitute for telling someone ""good work today.""",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Mesquite, TX",4/1/20,2020,4,1

A great first job to have- but not something you want to stay in.,"I spent about six months at Walmart and realized it was time to quit when I came to the realization that the cons were greatly outweighing the pros. I can't speak for every location, but the Walmart I worked for was very unorganized. The way they scheduled things made it so there were too many cashiers in the day time. Then once night comes, we'd be so understaffed that the lines were practically endless. I can't count on my hands how many times there were only two, or three if it was a good night, of us on the registers when we clearly needed more people. The poor scheduling made for unnecessarily difficult shifts. Thankfully, a lot of the customers were really understanding at the location I worked and usually wouldn't take it out on you for long lines or being slow if you're in training. _x000D__x000D_Walmart is very physically demanding. Don't think that it won't be just because you're on the register because all those endless heavy items you're scanning is what you're going to have lift and bag as well. It seems really easy until you have to do it. Everytime I left work, I'd go to my apartment and crash from the physical toll. _x000D__x000D_There were, however, some good aspects. For one, it's a great job to have if you need a lot of hours, expectantly or unexpectantly, because you can pretty much clock out whenever (you just can't clock in any earlier than nine minutes before).

A lot of managers do not need to be managers it mind boggling how half of these people are managers. Some of them have no people skills.  Some will nag at the workers that do work and turn a blind eye to the lazy ones and let them get away with nearly anything. I should not have to ask for the weekends off. It should be rotated with everyone instead of being given to the same people every week or swapping with three or four people instead of the whole team. A I have witnessed bullying by managers, favoritism, unethical behavior, so many different store managers and assistant managers have come and left. my job is not hard yet my manager wants to always pick on me when I work harder than most. There needs to be a better system for determining who can become a manager. I am not the only person that is being picked on in my department as there have been quite a few of us that are either still working with me or have left the company. I have witnesses to everything I have stated. I have had people wanting me to be the manager and I did become a department manager but then they got rid of the position and when it opened back up I was not given the opportunity to try and get it again.

Intestinal fortitude required to be here,Simply stated you will get paid well to be worked. Most of the work is actually hard and people don’t expect that out of this company.

Take the good with the bad,"Walmart as a company is fantastic. There are many benefits, volunteer opportunities, discounts, education, advancement options, flexible hours, you name it, Walmart probably does it. Unfortunately you need to work as a team and have a strong team leader, and the management team is a rotating door.

Great store to work at.,Because of moving around a lot. I was able to be hired back on with the company 3 times at 3 locations. Different Departments ran differentially. So what was good on one side of the store was not on others. Expectations for each department were not the same.

Never schedule enough associates to do the work that they expect of you.,"I don't understand why they never schedule enough people to cover breaks, and lunches. The register block s the cashier  out after 6 hours. So wouldn't it make sense to bring the next shift in an hour sooner. Hello, it may not be peak time, but the computer is just that.

Productive and fun place with a lot of friendly drivers who share one goal,"A typical day at parcel (owned by walmart) would be to scan shipment then load it onto your van.

Best job,Over all Wal-Mart was my favorite job but sadly management was not up to par. A new manager every month who had to learn everything and had no idea what they were doing they would get tired of it and either change departments or quit.

The happiness in the customers you help.,Beware of cap2. Some managers are there to help you and some are there for themselves. Notice everything that is going on around you and do what you are told. Bit your tongue and don't get angered by or towards other associates or your boss. You are there to work and not to make friends. Time to make friends is after you clock out.

Walmart Associate,Walmart has its pros and cons. The pay rate should be more for certain positions. They’ll close some departments and make other departments learn those tasks without a raise in pay.

Some of them feel entitled.,3,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,Georgia,3/26/20,2020,3,26
Worse time of my life.,Coworkers were great but management was awful. They always thought they were better than you and made sure you knew it.

Better before benefits slash,"Management was mostly rude and uninterested in helping certain departments. Overnight stockers and truck-crew were and probably still are the whipping boys of the store. They do the majority of the work, have the most rigid schedules, and by far the most under-appreciated. Especially given the odd one size fits all vibes such as the same break times, every department blames everything upon them, and everyone gets a write up when one member makes a mistake. _x000D__x000D_    A lot of stores follow this mindset but I had a much better experience working at other stores and different departments but the truck-crew whipping boy reputation seems universal.",3,Former Employee,Retail Associate ,"Lodi, CA",3/25/20,2020,3,25

Great benefits but the environment is the absolute worst.,"I worked for Wal-Mart FC 7422 in Bethlehem,PA for six years. That place is completely backwards. The management there is the absolute worst from the General manager down. Managers literally do nothing all day and have no idea what they are doing. They drive around on little carts and never answer their radios or phones. Asset Protection associates currently working there are mostly complete blithering idiots. They stay on the phone in the office not working and while at the truck gate they are on their phones the entire time. People there are so disgusting they removed the paper towels because they couldn't stop throwing used paper towels onto the bathroom floor. If you are comfortable in a prison like environment then by all means sign up for a job at this circus of a warehouse. If you just need a job to pay bills it's fine but for a career they will try to run you into the ground.

Employees were extremely racist at least at the location I was working at and since the location wasn’t very good things got stolen way too many times. Maybe 10-20 items a day from just me finding packages alone.

On the other hand, I had to speak with upper management regarding the treatment of my patients and myself from the other staff members; which I told her to look at surveillance to confirm.  The work flow was great because the pharmacy remained busy.  The company itself is wonderful to work for, but some of the more insecure staff try to make it almost impossible to keep the position.",2,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Spring, TX",3/22/20,2020,3,22
Very Productive but not Manageable,"My typical day started by unloading produce trucks and stacking boxes on palettes so that they could be stocked later in the evening. I've learned valuable speaking skills and how to answer customers questions. Management ranges between different stores. I never had a good experience with the managers or supervisors because it seemed like they didn't care at all about their employees or their well being. Coworkers were very friendly and loved to talk, especially with customers. The hardest part of the job was during the end of the shift pulling water palettes as they weighed over 800+lbs. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was working together with coworkers to get the truck unloaded.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Colville, WA",3/22/20,2020,3,22

I learned how to slice meat/cheese on a slicer and deal with frying things in a fryer. My manager was no a nice person though she did try for the customers.

If a pandemic is actively effecting us, why are we coming to work in one of the most public places. Wiping down carts and buttons won't stop germs from flying in the air. It's just sad to me how much money this company makes, but won't even offer paid leave at a time like this unless you actually catch the virus.

Walmart is an okay company to work for.,"Walmart is an okay company to work for. It is not a company to work for if you are career minded. Walmart is a very simple first-step kind of job.

Great Company but lacks good workers,"My overall experience at this Walmart was not the greatest, there's just very bad experiences with bad co-workers, their workers who have worked for years, including managers are very lazy, lack responsible, feel empowered, even people who just started or are not managers or supervisors think they can boss you around and even think they can make you do their job for them. I started very excitedly as this was my first job and it was a good starting rate for it too but I quickly realized that their workers are lazy and don't do their jobs and they get away with it. there could be 10 people scheduled to close and there was only 2 working? where many others be? you may ask, oh well taking their 15-minute break for an hour, or shopping around with no uniform or even hiding behind shelves eating, what they go out pretending to be costumers, buy. It was a complete disappointment because the lazy workers only did their job when they were watched and that leaves the people who do their jobs perfectly on a daily regardless of others get the backlash because of the lazy workers all of the sudden blame the defenseless hard-working employees. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WILL MAKE THIS COMPANY RISE! HIRE THEM AND FIRE ALL THE LAZY EMPLOYEES INCLUDING MANAGERS WHO ABUSE THEIR POWER! REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE! THEY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.",2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Parkesburg, PA",3/19/20,2020,3,19

Terrible...corrupt...shameful.,Not sure where to start. I guess the only place to avoid the corruption and lies is cashier. Cap 2 is the worst place to work in that store and the managers seem to target us the most. Overnight gets stretched and worn out by the rest of the shifts. There is no set task. No set rules. This walmart does not follow the proper ethics and rules set forth by the company. It does whatever it chooses. security...that doesn't exist in stor and people often lose their jobs from sickness...being over worked. Pregnant women are pregnant hard positions. There is extreme preference and favourites. Alot of under table behind closed doors corruption. They destroy the good managers and they turn rotten to the core.

There is the occasionally angry customer or there may be a ton of freight in the back that you have to go through, but that is to be expected in a store. I've learned a lot from the company and it helped me out through college, figuring out the do's and don'ts of a business and how it can be ran effectively. My advise is to not over-work yourself, take a deep breath, and do what you can do. Sometimes you just have to take it one day at a time.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Franklin, IN",3/18/20,2020,3,18

"not a  bad place to work ,just poor management",all in all walmart is a great place.but the importance of respect and caring about your worker is big for me.i feel the point system is unbalanced and not realistic.and the management should engage with workers more.they should take more time to figure out whats going on in people life instead of just firing people or lack of knowledge about they personal life.,3,Current Employee,Stocker/Customer Service ,"Monroe, MI",3/15/20,2020,3,15

Poor management!,"Working for walmart for more than a year has shown me that the managers do not care about the employees. Their motto literally is ""who's number one? The customer always."" They take away your days off without telling you and then punish you for taking a day off.

Good for work-pay ratio but not for work-life ratio,"First and foremost the pay is good at 11.50 an hour, but it came at the cost of not having a life outside of work. The management is usually bad at scheduling since many have not been employees. When I worked, mind I worked part-time, my hours were close to full-time hours with just a few minutes off. The only part that kept me staying a bit longer was the close comradery between workers and bonds that are built; since many quit during my time working. The workplace culture is relaxed as the only rush is weekends and after 6 pm. Walmart is a great beginner job or for someone that just wants the cash immediately as for those that are not, Walmart has more cons than pros in the long run in my eyes.",3,Former Employee,Dairy/Frozen Associate ,"Mesquite, TX",3/14/20,2020,3,14

"Pay was good, but disorganized place","People were kind for the most part, but there were the occasional bad apples. Management was a little off, and it was never made very clear who your manager was. It's pretty obvious that the company doesn't care for their own employees, considering how if you took a day off, they would give you a .5 penalty, and there were some days that were double penalty (once you reached 5 points, you were fired.) Training wasn't very clear, either. You were basically shoved into the position you were hired for, and had to either ask coworkers for assistance, or the occasional SM's, who were never around and took a long time to assist any trainees if they needed it. While I am grateful for the learning experience, the whole place was kind of a mess.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Colorado Springs, CO",3/13/20,2020,3,13

Walmart work,"Compared to most retail companies Walmart pays well, but they maintain high expectations for that pay.  Work life balance is very poor and you can easily work 60-70 hours per week.

Profit over People mentality is unsustainable.,"The basic job functions are fine, but in the Randallstown MD store especially there's a significant lack of care towards work, too much of a push to get work done fast over getting it done correctly which leads to safety issues, there are certain managers that cannot be reasoned with and are absolute sycophants who cannot think for themselves, associates care little about the work beyond bare minimum, if that, to keep the job and paycheck, the back room is always a mess every week if not every day due to trash dumping by the baler and associates leaving articles in random areas, and when issues are brought up they MAY receive a TEMPORARY fix, but will return to squalor within the month. If you must work at Walmart, save yourself the anguish and go to any other Walmart than Randallstown MD. At least there's a chance they'll be decent, but even then the pay isn't worth the hassle. $11 an Hour isn't much given Maryland living expenses...the sense of putting Profit over People is appalling and should not be encouraged.",2,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Randallstown, MD",3/11/20,2020,3,11

"I was “displaced” at Walmart Optical Lab, and found out from the local news. At the distribution center, they said I quit, but I did not quit.","I highly doubt if I would go back to Walmart.

"They were alright, a good first job",Fast paced but had too much expectations right away. Other than that I enjoyed working with Walmart. The management is a little scattered. They hire a bunch of people then then a bunch of them go and are really picky who they keep.,4,Former Employee,Walmart unloader/stocker ,"Lakeville, MN",3/11/20,2020,3,11
"Poor flexibility with schedules, while great pay.","The pay was the only good reason to stay, however, I personally had issues with three things: the managers often are too busy or preoccupied, the electronics section is far too busy and crowded with customers with bad attitudes, and I was often stuck lifting around 70 lb. televisions on my own and carrying them to the closest cart, where the case would often leave me exhausted and eventually with chronic back pain.",2,Former Employee,Photo Lab Associate ,"Knoxville, TN",3/11/20,2020,3,11
No guidance or everybody is for self,Walmart could be a great job if the company cared about employees more then money.

Management needs motivation,"Every shift is consistent in terms of work load and duties. Management seem to not know as much about their employees as much as the employees know each other in terms of how they work and what can make them work their best. The work environment itself is very bland. The hardest parts of the job were the weeks, or even months of waiting on management to hire in replacements for their skeleton crews. I found myself happiest when we had a full and organized team of associates, which had been quite some time ago.",3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Signal Mountain, TN",3/11/20,2020,3,11
Stressful environment,"I primarily worked weekends which were the busiest times at this particular store. This job required me to be on my feet for the whole shift (I'm young not a huge deal). The only issue was standing in the same spot all day basically. Customers were not always respectful and made inappropriate advances at times. A big issue was running out of change, which in turn required me to wait until a CSM brought me the change needed. That in turn would hold up the line and cause customers to become agitated. I came in contact with many different types of people and that was the most rewarding part of this job for myself.",4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Morristown, TN",3/11/20,2020,3,11
"Everyday low prices, vast variety of items to purchase",I worked for Walmart for 10 months and enjoyed it.

Horrible place to work unless you only want a few hours,Horrible staff in general but the managers are literally the worst.

Try not to get sick.,"The point system they have now isnt the same as before. They allow you 5 before they let you go. Any more than 5 and they give you the boot. yeah, so what? So, what they do now is give you two points for no call no show and then double that on holidays and days that employees are to mandatorily attend work, so if you’re sick and have to call out, it hurts, BAD.

High turn over due to poor management practices,"High expectations with little to no support.  In the On Line Grocery area of the store, employees are under constant pressure to keep up with the unreasonable amount of orders processed by corporate office.  With only a small staff of associates to pick orders, Walmart customers are often left waiting for delivery of groceries to their vehicles beyond the promised time frame.  The associates and staff are often behind preparing for these deliveries and management has to pull other department associates to assist in process.  This presents a problem for the whole store because the stocking crew is moved to this OGP department to fill these orders and not stock shelves.  Without product on shelves, often management and other associates are devoting a majority of their time all working on line grocery.  It has become a poor managed circle of incompetence throughout the store, ending in poor store performance, frustrated associates, and poor customer service throughout this store.  Unacceptable time management and failure to identify concerns mentioned has resulted in high turn over of good associates and a unpleasant working environment for all.",2,Former Employee,ORDER PICKER ,"Troy, MO",3/10/20,2020,3,10

I loved my job,I loved my job while I was working at my Walmart. I describe it as my Walmart because everyone one that works there no matter how long rather it be 1 month or 50 years every treats you like family and makes you feel like you belong and so everyone there becomes part of your Walmart family. Of course you will still bump heads with some of your friends there but nothing feels better than when you can show who you really are by joking around with your manager and they joke right back.

Management could use some work,"My experience with the management team at Walmart was all but a positive one. The managers tend to pick favorites and do petty things to make the people they don’t like have a harder time.

Not the best choice,"Started a fun place to work, quickly turned into an awful place of employment. After all of the talk about how great it is to work there and how much they care, they really ring you dry afterwards. Managers are babysitters and not leaders. Micromanagers that didn't give you any opportunity to think for yourself. Morale was extremely negative after being told to hush. Problems were not solved by managers. Mandatory overtime on days off, no exceptions even for childcare issues. Almost every complaint would be turned to how well you are paid. You either became brainwashed to keep your job or you refused and struggled to fit within the ""needs of the company.""",1,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Raymond, NH",3/10/20,2020,3,10

Fun and exciting place to work.  I felt as if I was very important to the success of the company,"Employees were constantly being motivated.   We always had team building exercises.  Employees were encouraged to advance and try new positions.  As far as the company was concerned, the sky was the limit.  Their promotions were based off of interview skills.  This could be hard and limit individuals that didn't interview well.  I had worked for Wal-Mart at two other previous times.  The company culture wasn't new to me.  They make you feel as if their company can't succeed without you and that you are very important to them.

They dont allow overtime but still ask you to stay late and then have you cut the time before the week ends to make sure you do not get overtime. Management is never on the same page. You get told one thing and then get in trouble for not following policy depending on the manager regardless of the direction the previous manager gave you.

Mediocre place to work,Walmart has many different shifts/positions to meet most any need in terms of hours and individual capabilities. The pay is about average. The upper management and HR at my store was unfortunately terrible and while Walmart states they are all about respect for the individual they have many workers that are extremely biased towards certain populations and clearly show it without being reprimanded by management.

Most of the time, managers have no clue what they are doing and don’t truly know how to advance the store to make them truly stand out.",3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Jefferson City, MO",3/9/20,2020,3,9

Work and home balance,Most people look the least amount of work as long as you are friends with the managers you will not have problems.

Great pay,"It's a great company to work for, but when you get managers that take there position to there heads and treat you like your the sum on the bottom of there feet it makes you not want to work there all because they're to lazy to do anything for themselves.

My Walmart experience,Walmart was pretty good at the start. And I can only speak for the one in my city. But management was rude and disrespectful. They didn’t care and simply just ignored everything I had to say. Which then I quit.,2,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Willmar, MN",3/9/20,2020,3,9
No respect for their workers.,"Management has no idea what actually happens, and does not care about their employees._x000D__x000D_For example, when I started, the Co-Manager instructed me to do something, which I did exactly what he said to do. A bit later, I had the Department manager threatening to write me up. Let's recap. The Co-Manager is second in command of the store. Department Manager is the first level of management. That means Co-Manager's orders take priority. If a Department Manager wants to write me up for obeying a Co-Manager, that is insubordination, which is grounds for a court martial. End of discussion._x000D__x000D_Things only got worse from there. One particular day, the team unloading trucks were talking, instead of working. They were over two hours overdue on that truck. So, I got pulled off my job, to go back there, and whip these kids into shape. I got that truck unloaded in just over an hour. Later, management decided to write up these kids for talking when they should have been working. Well, they decided to include ME in that write up, just because I was back there. No. The entire reason management sent me back there in the first place was to make them start working, which I did. If you need to pull me off my job to bail you out, the only answer is ""Thank you, Sir.""_x000D__x000D_Several hours later, I was back at my own job. When the second truck came, the unloading team was back to their usual antics of talking, instead of working. I didn't get sent back there this time. Even still, when they got written up for that, I got written up as well. Right. So, you are writing me up for something that happened when - more...",1,Former Employee,Frozen/Dairy Associate ,"Kennewick, WA",3/9/20,2020,3,9

I work in the optical. Nothing really stands out.,"I work in the optical department. Advancement is almost impossible as Wal-Mart requires a Pharmacist be an area manager. The patients are primarily medicaid. The staff seems to be the people who couldn't get jobs elsewhere. Wal.Mart is run by attitude rather than by knowledge and experience. Thus, knowledge and experience is frowned upon by my bosses. Wal-Mart uses the Points System to monitor employees infractions. Being a licensed professional I find this insulting. The thing I hear constantly is professionalism and customer service. The optical lacks  both of these. The opticians have to break away from a patient to answer the phones. These phones are in the middle of the room as are the dispensing stations. This allows all the patients to over hear every thing said to each other patient. This is a HIPPA concern. The pay is ok. Over all the prices are cheap, the patients are economically challenged, no professionalism, and treated like children. I don't recommend Wal-Mart optical.",1,Current Employee,Licensed Optician ,"Cleveland, OH",3/8/20,2020,3,8

A beginning job for a young person to get experience,"Managementt is non existent for training Schedules are almost changed weekly. Much favoritism to their favorites.

Quarterly bonuses if store does well and in 16 years, received maybe 5 bonuses ranging form $90 to $250. Customers can be of the lower economic rung and can be extremely obnoxious if you do not satisfy  or solve their customer problems. Usually management will overrule an associate even when following the store's policies. Anything to satisfy a customer.  Customers learn that if they have a complaint on  an associate and make waves about it, Walmart will give them a $25.00 gift card.

Even though I had two notes. They will NOT work with you availability wise and if you cannot work the schedule they give you, they just fire you. Even if it's because you're in college and need to alter your hours to fit your school schedule or because you have a child, I saw many employees either have to quit, got fired, or were forced to miss classes because the managers would not work with them.

Job Work/Life Balance is bad,"company has a good benefit ; Walmart has a long history of providing comprehensive health care and benefits to our associates, and we’re proud of the quality plans we offer, which are among the best in the retail industry.

Customer is the king.,Walmart is likely to have the highest employee turnover within the industry. It is a sad chapter in business management.  This creates sense of job insecurity.

It's What You'd Expect,"Walmart is fairly notorious for having dead-end positions, and acting as a cashier there is no different from most wholesalers.

They think employees can survive on 20 hours a week and complain when orders don't get filled and end up being cancelled because they only scheduled people to work 4 hours at a time.  _x000D_Other than scheduling and Managers who say we ""aren't moving fast enough"", its a great job.

As an entry position job the pay is not bad,"If you are looking for full time hours that may be tough even with an open availability.  Retail, of course depends on sales.  So, hours are always based on sales and the applicants availability. Based on yearly reviews you qualify for raises as well.

"Productive workplace, with steady work that keeps us busy","A typical day at work includes unloading our freight trucks onto a conveyor belt that keeps a count of items as I unload them. It is then sorted and stacked on pallets to be distributed throughout the store. I unload an average of 3,250 pieces a night. I also down-stack pallets that come pre-wrapped and are unable to be unloaded as the other freight is. The management crew varies in accordance with their salaries. It seems like the hourly management cares more about the employees, whereas the ""higher ups"" on the management team tend to care more about their salaries, and lining their pockets, over the associates and our work environment. I would say the hardest part of the job is breaking my body for $11.00 an hour. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and crew that I work with on a daily basis. We work well as a team, and always get our tasks completed on time.",3,Current Employee,Freight Team Associate ,"Searcy, AR",3/6/20,2020,3,6
Do Not Recommend,"I started my career with Walmart in 2008 as a college student and held various positions throughout my tenure there. In this small rural economy, Walmart is the community’s largest employer. After I got my bachelor’s degree, I stayed with Walmart w/ goals to advance within the company. Things were going well until my last 2 years w/ the company, when corporate began implementing questionable policies and programs that were neither in the best interest of employees or shareholders/customers. Additionally and in this case most importantly, store management changed hands. This was the turning point. _x000D__x000D_Management is going to be the determining factor of your experience at Walmart. At my store, there was a very obvious lack of leadership and those in charge of daily operations had no interest in employee development and refused to jump in and help when needed. Furthermore, the management team in charge at my store did not conduct themselves ethically nor did they treat their employees with dignity or respect. Regardless of how hard you worked, your efforts were not acknowledged and the lack of resources in addition to a consistently overwhelming workload were enough to discourage me from continuing my career with the company. _x000D__x000D_If hired, be advised that you may be required (i.e forced) to accept up to 5 different job codes just to get hours. Ultimately, what this means is that you’ll have to be flexible and willing to work any and all positions in the store. _x000D__x000D_Training is rushed and evidently ineffective.

Good for a starting job till you find what you really like,"this job was the longest job I've ever had, almost 4 years until I decided to go for a job I thought I was going to really like, but with the almost 4 years I've had at Walmart some weren't the best and some where the best. I started working at Walmart part-time in 2015 when I was still in high school, then once I finished school I went to full time as a cashier/customer service for almost 1.5 years. in those 1.5 years I went on to go do a store remodel in Steamboat Springs Co, I went fro 4 month but wasn't what I wanted to do with my life. I went to work in the electronics department of Walmart after the remodels. Worked in electronics for 5 month before I switched to the TLE (Tire Lube Express) department till April 2019. you'll hear this about every retail job ""the management sucked but the employees are the best"" and its not all correct but some what correct. In my thoughts why people thought that management wasn't the best is because they viewed their supervisor or manager as a friend instead of a manager.

There were countless issues at other places I worked that management did not adhere to.  With walmart my voice was heard and problems were solved while keeping productive.  The biggest takeaway that I have had from this job is that there is always a way to be more efficient without having to strain harder.  I have taken this practice into my own personal life and it makes doing chores a breeze.

"Great Work Environment, Until You Need Manager's Help","So I really enjoyed working at Walmart as a cashier, and my experience as an employee really surpassed my expectations. Working in the customer service roles, though weird at times, was always fun and easy work. I love working with people, and customer service is something I'm very good at, so I was very satisfied with the position I had. As a student, scheduling was perfect, and I could always pick up extra hours if I needed. Whilst I was working, I had no complaints. _x000D__x000D_The only thing that can ruin your experience at Walmart is if your store has terrible management. I was accidentally terminated by the computer system after my manager and I had a misunderstanding about how I was going to take Christmas break off. When I returned after break, I discovered I did not have a job. After having multiple conversations with two of my managers for now over two months, I have not been able to be rehired, even though I was given permission to rejoin the team by one of these managers. If you need something from your managers at Walmart, don't count on them to help you. They just don't care, and they don't know how to communicate with each other to get something done. At least, that's how it was at the store I worked at. _x000D__x000D_It's a shame that this has been my experience, because I did not mind working there, and enjoyed parts of my job.

Public perception is not reality,"Most who have worked for Walmart will agree... Walmart claims to be about saving people money so they can live better when in reality they only mean those who aren't employed with them.  Flexibility in work schedule... sure if you want minimal hours each week.  Work/Home life balance... that means work is your life and there is little to no home life.  Walmart becomes your life.  _x000D_I believe Sam Walton would be very disappointed and extremely sadden by what his company has become when it comes to how associates are treated.  I could go into so many examples of this just from my 8+ years of working for Walmart but I won't because Walmart has already taken enough time from me and my home life, costing me a marriage, friendships and my health.  This is my parting gift to them since theirs to me was lack of respect, care and understanding during the most difficult time of life so far._x000D__x000D_If you are single with no plans of EVER getting married, having children, friends or any type of personal life then they are the career you want.  For me, and those like me, who want a life that doesn't revolve around Walmart I recommend never taking any position in a store!  Do not get pulled in by their talk of all these great things and how they will treat you.  Respect for the individual is one of their core beliefs but going from a pt maintenance associate all the way up to salary I seen it all and I can tell you they will not treat you with respect, all they want from you is a yes man no matter the situation.

"Easy job, but avoid getting stuck.","Working Cap 2 is easy enough. It's the most physically demanding job in the store if you're on the GM trucks (this is coming from someone who's worked as a cart pusher and a Lawn and Garden Associate), but very rarely do those trucks take longer than 3 hours to complete with the automated sorting line. With a manual line it'll be around 2 hours.

This company is okay.,"I worked at a Walmart in Tampa, FL in 2017. I worked there for two months before I left. My coworkers were amazing and my CSM's were okay. My main CSM once yelled for not doing something, she never told me to do and I seen other cashiers not do. Another CSM refused to give change one night meaning I couldn't the customer correct change and he got mad when I kept asking for change. I was never allowed to go back and complete my computer training, which you have a deadline of 90 days to complete. One day, a cashier came in sick and halfway through her shift, she lost her voice and the CSM didn't let her go home. Lastly, the management people made everyone, who didn't open availability, change their availability to open. I remember an older cashier complaining about that. _x000D_The only thing I liked about working was the people. They were like a one, big, happy family. I have a few anxiety attacks and my coworkers were always there to help. My anxiety attacks were my main reason for leaving. _x000D_I don't think will ever work for Walmart, again.

"Good people, overworked.","When the store is on process, the department is a piece of cake. My store is absolutely not even close to being on process and because of that each of my OGP associates is doing the workload of 2 people easy. I am also having to cover the workload of 3-4 people as the work conditions have caused the crew to not care about their performance. Our assistant manager has been on a leave of absence for 4 1/2 of the 6 months they've been in the role. When I brought this to the store managers attention they tell me it's none of my business. I'm supposed to lead but have no power to stick up for my team when it's needed. Longest I've ever been at a single job in my life, but also the most I've ever hated a job in my life.

It's okay,"People are mostly pretty easy going there, which makes it more enjoyable. Management is constantly changing because they will move on to a new position or different store and someone else comes in. I've had 3 different front end managers in less than 2 years and lots of different CSMs. Cashiers can get promoted to CSMs so you already know the new ones._x000D__x000D_Attendance policy doesn't give you much wiggle room which is frustrating, especially if you get really sick or there is inclement weather. Things that are completely out of your control will rack up points against you. If you have enough PPTO, you can cover shifts you've missed without getting a point, but it takes a while to earn enough hours to cover it. _x000D__x000D_As far as weekly hours, I get a decent amount even part time, but I also know not all part time cashiers get tons of hours. I'm not sure how that's all settled; I assume it's based on availability. There is a shortage of people willing to work until late at night which makes those shifts especially difficult if you are the only one._x000D__x000D_The easiest part is generally the work is mindless, and it's nice when you are asked to help with things that get you off the register. I personally liked dropping tills. The hardest part is just dealing with customers. The Walmart I work at prioritizes customer satisfaction so no matter how rude they are, you have to please them somehow.

The people you work with and the experience you give the customer sets the example.,Communication is key to a great workplace. Seeing a positive attitude in what you bring to work as well as your peers at work will drive not only your mentality from open to close or clock in and clock out.

I appreciated the orderly environment. I learned the importance of happiness in the workplace and how work can be enjoyable when you are around individuals you get along with. Management was the same. I got along well with all of the staff, and they were often very respectful and helpful. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with a couple of unsavory fellow associates, but that's it.

They do not care as much about their associates as other employers, such as Target, where I worked for four years.  They do not expect to advance any members of the cart crew to positions that stay in the store for the entire shift.

The leadership team especially the store manager is lousy!! Loved the customers tho!! They are NOT family friendly especially with this new point system and ESPECIALLY if you’re new.

They're good people and the people there, although you may not see eye to eye with them, are all trying to do what you're doing, which is: keep customers happy. But, like any job, this job has its downsides. Customers can be testy, as they- for some reason- believe that because you work at Walmart, they can treat you rudely. Additionally, You will quickly begin to realise that the company itself has no concern for anything but money, and this, unfortunately, means that this reflects upon the managers as well- it could frequently have been questioned as to whether my manager cared about my well-being. It's a great place to work if you need money, cuz they pay well, but just keep in mind that's one of the few things you will get while working there.",3,Former Employee,eCommerce Personal Shopper ,3180 South 5600 West,3/1/20,2020,3,1

Changes and changes,"The way working here will depend entirely on how well the management teams work together. There is a lot of micromanaging from the higher ups and you are constantly working (which is fine because this is a place to work). I would advise, per my experience, do not take on any extra work that was not yours to start. I lost my job because they had me working 5 other people's jobs and could not really complete the tasks that were given, making us all look bad. There are definitely pros to working here, everyone, for the most part wanted to work together so no one had bad blood. And you'll get an hour lunch as well, and some will give company freebies like donuts or sandwiches from time to time to celebrate the company. Those were always nice, that and you'll always have the opportunity to get two 15 minute breaks.

Walmart gave me my first true opportunity as a remodel associate._x000D__x000D_The work wasn't bad, aside from my feet hurting SO MUCH after walking around or standing for four to six hours. I'm someone who likes to get all their work done ASAP, so I didn't like the mandatory hour-breaks for lunch. I'd rather just do all my work and leave. As far as work goes, it was basic associate stuff: stocking, restocking, aiding customers, etc. I worked at night from 10PM to 7AM so there were never many customers.

Nothing special.,"I have gone from O/N frozen and dairy to O/N stocker to O/N mod team. I have finally found what suits me best on the mod team, and the ONLY problem is the inconsistency in hours. In fact, the reason for requesting my most recent move to the mod team was to be able to get a more consistent schedule, which worked perfectly for about 3 weeks and now they're back to cutting me down to 16 hours/wk, which is what I was getting before. Depending on this job for my livelihood was a big mistake. Every time things are going my way, they cut hours. EVERY time. That is my only real beef with this company, besides the terrible management. I can deal with difficult managers/co-workers, but I need consistency in my hours in order to be able to basically live my life and be able to pay my bills.

Good for temporary quick job,"I honestly would say this is only for the store I work at. Considering I have only worked at this one Neighborhood Market, I’m a little biased in this review. However, I feel people may benefit from it anyway. I love working with some people that I work with. Actually met my best friend here. And the work itself isn’t hard- well shouldn’t be. Management has us running around too much doing jobs we weren’t hired to do or even shouldn’t be doing. If you call out or request off, they will schedule you a whole week off or even schedule you 16 days in a row with 1 day off in between (personal experience). The paid time off would be great if we got enough to cover day to day life. But unfortunately new employees only get protected pto which is only for sick days and who how often do you get sick in a short amount of time? Life happens but they only care about the money. Walmart as a company started as a caring company for the employees and the customers. Unfortunately they only care about money at this point. And that is extremely unfortunate.",2,Current Employee,Produce Associate ,"Lexington, NC",2/28/20,2020,2,28
Cutting Down,"For the last year or so wal-mart seems to want to keep cutting cost on employees which means, more work load on each assosiate. Old roles keep getting elimnated while the work load of those old roles are pushed down to other assosiates, while the standerd for each job must be maintaned , this put a lot of work on a few assosiates and made the job way more stressful, Managers can very, from motivating  and encourging to adding to the stress with even more work load.",4,Current Employee,OverNight Support Manager ,"Panorama City, CA",2/28/20,2020,2,28

Outsourcing for cheaper labor,"Walmart is outsourcing much of its technological aspects to other countries like India. The lack of quality is highly apparent with its Retail Link website, which consists of many applications, log in issues and various problematic processes which occur with other teams._x000D__x000D_These applications do not have the contact information for the team responsible for the application; instead, vendors are forced to call in to Retail Link's level one team (which requires a 20 minute ordeal because they somehow think a voice recognition software works better) only to then be transferred to the team that actually supports the application (which may require another voice recognition ordeal to actually reach them as well). _x000D__x000D_It makes absolutely no sense to have to call a team, only to be transferred to another team who owns the application. Time is money and Walmart is losing out on those pennies as well._x000D__x000D_As the new site was implemented, it was obvious that they do not mirror the LIVE site on their backend servers, which of course caused various issues with logging in, password changes, application changes. Calling in results in being transferred to the actual team that supports the apps (again, the contact info for the team that supports the application SHOULD be embedded in the main page of the application). _x000D__x000D_Walmart would not need a level one Retail Link team at all (they could be absorbed into the level 2 team or whatever they're called) if Walmart had any good business sense at all (which seems to have been outsourced as well or the decision-making jobs went to buddies without any - more...",1,Former Employee,Specialist ,"Several, kept being moved around like furniture",2/28/20,2020,2,28

okay job but management is to picky,"My position if a cashier was an okay and fairly easy job and it was less stressful place than my last job. They pay well and give decent brakes, but they are too strict in other ways. if you don't have enough time off earned (which takes a while to save up) to cover your whole shift and you get sick and have to call off, they give you a point. If you reach 5 points in a 6 month period, they fire you. so if you are really sick and have to take a week off of work, you will probably lose your job. It also seems like you cant do anything wrong at all or they want to punish you somehow, like giving you less hours than normal for a few weeks, writing you up, or making you do an extra task that's not in your job description, like stocking a shelf when your a cashier.",2,Former Employee,Team member ,"Fort Wayne, IN",2/27/20,2020,2,27

Do not recommend.,"The customers were fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed the interaction and the customers themselves.  Enjoyed answering questions and assisting.  However, the workplace is one of the most horrendous that I have ever experienced.  I witnessed employees having breakdowns and shaking to where they would vomit because they were constantly told they could be replaced and/or they weren't fast enough because they needed to lose weight, employees were told they should look for another place to work, etc.  The behavior from the management staff including the ""HR"" department violated many laws (including hippa regulations).

Work/life balance is encouraged and supported with things such as flexible hours, vacation time, and paid time off (PTO).  Sometimes, however, expectations run too high when the individual stores are under staffed and associates' responsibilities are stretched.  This creates a stressful and sometimes hostile working environment that creates burnout for associates (especially during the holiday season).",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Gainesville, FL",2/27/20,2020,2,27

Good Job,"I like helping customers with the check out process by  being efficient, kind, and patient with the process. Management is always available when it was required to have a manager present. Walmart employees people of all ages. The hardest thing about working at walmart is adjusting to different hours.  I am used to  working  more of morning hours. When coming to Wal-mart their busiest time of day is late afternoons and early to late evenings, which is the normal for retail but was an adjustment for me. The best part about working  as a cashier at walmart is knowing I have  made someone's day better. Either getting them through the check out process fast, helping them load there cart, or just having a nice conversation.

Constantly being ran around and thrown in departments that was unfamiliar to me. I was fond of some of the workers and created great memories, but I would never work there again.

A horrible experience,"The managers would actively try to get me fired, and had made up situations in order to get me in trouble multiple times, including trying to get me arrested, despite having no probable cause. The employee I was stationed with the most absolutely despised me, and would constantly force me to do her work so she could talk to her friends. When management was notified of this, no action was taken. At one point, said associate actively prevented me from taking my breaks as scheduled, delaying them as late as possible. Management had also been known to leave me running the department alone for upwards of 9 hours with no help. When a request was put in for someone to cover my lunch break, no help was provided until the last possible second, meaning that the store was nearly sued, and I was nearly terminated due to incompetent management, due to the fact that no one would cover my shift, and in the state of MA, it is illegal to not take a break more than 6 hours after starting work.  I was routinely denied benefits with the exception of a 10% discount card, which I had received 6 months after I started work, rather than the usual 3 months it took for all other employees.",1,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Wareham, MA",2/26/20,2020,2,26

Greedy company,"I had the singular privilege of working at Walmart as they transitioned emphasis to Walmart.com and Site to Store.  They worked so hard to compete online with Amazon, a company that itself could never compete with Walmart's brick and mortar presence, that they essentially threw the entire company under the bus.  Now, their policies are geared more than I've ever seen towards working people as hard as they can, while paying them as little as they can.  Every employee is now expected to have two jobs, a primary and a secondary, but of course only be paid for one wage. Mid and lower level management positions are being removed, and then ""new"" positions with the same responsibilities are being offered for less pay. Management is doing what they can to stack additional tasks on employees, first as a ""hey can you this for me?"" and then as an expectation.  Once you become acclimated to that, ""hey can you also do this for me?""  I also had the pleasure of being there when their promotion system was removed.  It used to be that you were given a raise in accordance with your job performance. Good performance meant a higher annual raise.  Now, all employees, regardless of their skill and performance, are given a raise roughly equivalent to the earlier ""poor performance"" raise.  All in all, my experience at Walmart was poor.  But it did give me the incentive I needed to go back to school, get a degree, and find a much better job!",1,Former Employee,Hard Currency Exchange Technician ,"Pasco, WA",2/26/20,2020,2,26

Walmart is a great place to work for students. They are very flexible with schedules and are very lenient.,"Walmart is a great place to work for students. They lay well and are very flexible with anyone mostly student. It is a great first job and the associates are very nice. It’s hard to enjoy a workplace where you get along with most of the employees working there but not here. If you’re positive and do your job, you won’t have any trouble with anything or anyone.
