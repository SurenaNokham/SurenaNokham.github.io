It's Okay,"I worked in OGP and loved my management and most of the people who worked in my department. The customers can be nice, but most of the time you'll deal with angry mothers who need to pick up their kids from school and decide to come get their groceries at one of the busiest times of the day or angry old people. If the store calls other departments to help you're gonna hear people complain nonstop. You can work yourself into the ground and bend over backwards, but the upper management won't acknowledge your work or even care to put you on full time. I worked part-time but basically worked full time and stepped in when managers needed breaks and they still wouldn't put me on full-time. The pay is great, but the job is not easy.",3,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Nampa, ID",7/26/21,2021,7,26
"Okay workplace, leave when you can ","This job was not the move. I had to do other people’s job while they were goofing around. If you have a problem and go to management about it, chances are they won’t do anything or look into it. The pay is decent and it’s not hard to move up in the company unless management has favorites. ",2,Current Employee,Cap 1 Stocker ,"Ogden, UT",7/26/21,2021,7,26
great co-workers,Some management really care and others do not. The co-workers help make the day go by faster. The training could be better. There is little advancement opportunities.,3,Former Employee,Online Shopper ,"Detroit, MI",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Stressful and Tiring Workspace,"If it was not for my coworkers and recent pay raise, I would not have stayed as long as I have. The management style is micro-managed and there is always something changing. The hours are practically set, but tend to bring the stress home. ",3,Current Employee,Personal Shopper/Sales Associate ,"Pontiac, IL",7/26/21,2021,7,26
"Great coworkers, the rest is lacking.","Title says it all. Management can be difficult to work with, nearing on the impossible sometimes. Always understaffed, no OT allowed as they will make you cut it somewhere. Upward mobility is there if you want it, but pay is not worth the responsibilities. Management stays until all their tasks are done, NOT when they are supposed to leave. Very common for management to work 14+ hours days 5-6 days at a time. However, the coworkers you'll interact with are, for the most part, great and will make your experience better.",2,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Albany, NY",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Bad management. Good benefits.,"Good benefits at the job. Plenty of breaks, 401K, Stock investment, PTO, etc.Pay is nice.

Dont work for walmart longterm,"Walmart pays long-term associates the rate as new ones. There is no compensation for good work, loyalty, or advancement.

"Coworkers and department managers were great, store manager actively made things worse",I worked here for a bit over a year and loved my coworkers and my produce managers. Store manager would go out of his way to make our work harder just because he believed everything needed to be moved or cleaned at all times of the day. No chance to move up unless you wanted to be talked down to.,2,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Mont Belvieu, TX",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Decent ,I didn’t know work there for long but meeting new people was fun. Management is nowhere to be found when you’re under 21 and someone has alc that you can’t sell ,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Naperville, IL",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Management sucks and the hours are ridiculous,Loved the neighborhood market in owasso. Hated the Vinita regular walmart. Management is a joke and they schedule you however they want even if you put in that you cannot work certain days. ,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Vinita, OK",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Horrible management ,"Management has unrealistic expectations. They always pick favorites. If you don’t suck up. You will have no opportunity for promotion.

Some of the managers need more training or a demotion,It was an okay experience but definitely not the best. It's not a company that I would want to work for again unless they gave better pay. Some of the managers are rude and talk down to you.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Store Associate ,"North Port, FL",7/26/21,2021,7,26

Okay place to work,"The managers are always on your back about getting your work done. Working as a stocker you're expected to stock within a certain time frame. Overall, its an okay place to work. Be prepared to hear rumors and gossip; there's always something going on. And there's a lot of favoritism. They always want you to give 150% to the company , but the company only gives you 10%. ",3,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Dover, DE",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Boring ,Good job if you are in high school. Room to grow if you are good with the higher ups. Close to home so commute was not an issue but shift was 4:30 to 1 pm.,5,Former Employee,Associate ,"Lilburn, GA",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Chaotic and understaffed,Great pay means killing yourself to stay on top of workflow. Constant hour cuts. Bad morale. Salaried pharmacists are basically having to come early and stay late or come in on days off to ensure the work is done. I work for free everyday.,2,Current Employee,Pharmacy Manager ,Pennsylvania,7/26/21,2021,7,26
"pays good, hard work",the pay/ benefits are good but the production numbers they want you to hit monthly are very hard to reach. They literally expect you hit 100% of your numbers,4,Former Employee,Loader/Unloader ,"Elwood, IL",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Management ,"Management was just terrible, the orientation took way longer than it should have. Overall the store was ran like children were there. The pay is good and you can actually get some hours.",3,Former Employee,Front End Associate ,Barksdale Blvd,7/26/21,2021,7,26
Good until the end,"Wal-Mart never treated me wrong until the end of my employment with them. While I was out on maternity leave, it was decided that my position in the company was being eliminated. Instead of the store manager, picking up the phone and calling me to inform me of this...I was sent a letter in the mail. That store manager would also ask certain things of my position, then when I did it; if he didn't like it..instead of telling me he would just have somebody else go behind my back and tear it all down and redo it. I felt like I was walking on egg shells around him all the time.  Luckily I had a good co manager who had my back and could go to about anything. I think it all depends on the store and the management team, I really enjoyed my Wal-Mart career until the end. ",4,Former Employee,Training Coordinator ,"Lexington, KY",7/26/21,2021,7,26
It’s not Enjoyable at all. Not very welcoming. You don’t get the help you need when you start working there. Overall Bad experience. ,It’s not Fun at all. I have been miserable the whole time i’ve worked there. There has been a certain manager that has hated me and yelled at me constantly since the day I started and it’s only been a few months. My boss isn’t there half of the time. The people there are really bossy and negative. they constantly talk about customers and other workers there. there are some people that are really nice and enjoyable to be around but it’s not likely you will be by them or around them. It’s not a happy place and it’s not worth working there having to deal with your coworkers and managers taking things out on everyone more than you have to deal with the customers. ,2,Current Employee,Asset Protection Customer Host ,"Tulsa, OK",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Not a bad place to work,Good job to have and it’s fun. I like electronics a lot fast paced but not crazy unless it’s Black Friday. Don’t let your vehicle break down or you may be out of a job like I was,4,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Lewisburg, WV",7/26/21,2021,7,26
High School Job,Enjoyed my time there.  I do not recommend for high school students due to the long shifts and little flexibility.  Never a dull day during the Christmas season.  ,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Spartanburg, SC",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Productive and good place to work,It was a good company but the managers were horrible. They work with your schedule and give you at least 32 hours a week but overall it wasn't that bad ,3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Greenville, TX",7/26/21,2021,7,26

Cap team 2,I would recommend it for someone making money stressful headache make you die on the inside not fun maybe you will cry                                    ,5,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Phenix City, AL",7/26/21,2021,7,26
"Love my managers, but things could better.","This really depends on what part of the store you are working at, but if you work the front end, salesfloor, or cart pushing you are getting paid a lot less than everyone else. Starting pay for cap2, deli, bakery, and OGP is $15 an hour overnights are getting $16.50. Whereas everywhere else is $11. I really like the people I work with as they're a good bunch, but the pay just doesn't seem fair at all. The job security is great as you just have to do your job which isn't really hard. Working as a self checkout host can be a little frustrating at times. Especially if you're all by yourself watching 8 machines on a busy day is mentally draining. All in all it's a good job, just wish it would pay better.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Casper, WY",7/26/21,2021,7,26
Deli Associate,It’s okay as a way to make money in college. Kind of hard to learn when they don’t train. Schedule is flexible for the most part. Money is decent for the work required. Point system is annoying. ,3,Current Employee,Deli/Bakery Associate ,"Cortland, OH",7/26/21,2021,7,26

I was interviewed with some manger that didn't even worked there,"This place is bad I was first interviewed with a manger that was visiting from another store.

Takes care of management,"Walmart does a wonderful job of taking care of their managers. Say yes, show up for work, work hard, don't complain, and be ready to always change and you will make it to management. Once there, as long as you're a great cheerleader and do what's asked, you'll be well taken care of as far as salary and bonuses.",4,Current Employee,Vision Center Area Manager ,"Bentonville, AR",7/25/21,2021,7,25
It was satisfactory at best Walmart isn’t for everyone.,It was a demanding job working while the pandemic was at its peak. I would work there again just never at that store in particular. They promise you management to keep you but they don’t act on it.,3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Pleasanton, CA",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Cultural awareness within employees and the company.,"They are conscious about helping employees to succeed and they are also very flexible with work schedules for students. Overall, its a great place to work for.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Minneapolis, MN",7/25/21,2021,7,25

Paid well,"The job paid well for thr Valley. Unloading and stocking merchandise was the name of the game and speed was of the essence. The supervisors of Cap 2 were fair and reasonable and were patient when it came to improving one's competence, alas I was a hopeless case so I made the decision to leave.I don't have any of the typical Walmart horror stories to entertain you. If you have open availability you will likely get a generous amount of hours. All in all Walmart can pay well and is quite competitive compared to other retailers in the business in the valley. ",3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Edinburg, TX",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Good Manager,"Walmart is a good place to work at. Luckily, in my area, I am surrounded with a good coworkers and managers.

not overly complicated  ,It's Walmart. Not a hard job as far as day to day tasks. If you want to work hard and show up every day on time there is plenty of room for advancement. Really neat if you want to learn how retail works from the inside at least from a stocker/grocery associate point of view.,4,Former Employee,stocker/grocery associate/ unloader ,"Grand Junction, CO",7/25/21,2021,7,25
One supervisor made a difficult job impossible,"A group of temporary hires were brought on during the lockdown to help tame the shelves. One welcome video and no training at all. In spite of that, one supervisor who apparently expected super-soldiers made ridiculous demands in limited times, and priorities would be entirely flipped for no reason. I had decades of retail experience and years of management experience, and he made me endure condescending lectures about ""customers liking the store to look good"" that you might give to a middle schooler. I left with a smile the first chance I got.",2,Former Employee,Temp Lockdown Help ,"Spartanburg, SC",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Nice environment and fairly easy work,The work is easy but physically tasking at times. It beats factory work. But the pay is far too low and they are always short staffs so the workload is huge,3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Wausau, WI",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Bad management ,"The Mattoon Walmart has management that uses their power to keep other employees from progressing to high paying jobs at the company. Also they ask for people to go out go their job description like for an example I was a cashier and they made me push carts while it was winter, and then they wanted to decline my day off for a doctors appointment. I worked there 2 years and did not have one raise. ",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Mattoon, IL",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Worst job ever,"The biggest issue with this company is that the managers seem to have not a care in the world for there employees. Even for the ones that work harder than anyone else a manager would just look right over them as if they were garbage. Nothing matters to the managers unless it is a problem with themselves. They pay is no where near where it needs to be, you shouldn’t have to put that much wear and tear on your body everyday for only $11.50/hr!",1,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Canyon, TX",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Fun jon,"It was a great place to work. Coworkers were friendly, pay was okay but the hours were excellent. I'd work at Walmart again and have nothing but good things to say",5,Former Employee,Stocker ,Toccoa,7/25/21,2021,7,25
Poor management,Management will find anything at all to coach you to be written up. Doesn't matter how small the issue is they will write you up. They expect since they raised the wage that you have to do the work of five people.,1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Carlisle, PA",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Great place to work for if you're willing to stay hourly management or lower.,Walmart has been good to me for the eight years I've been there but I feel like I have maxed out like there's nowhere else to go.

Set you up for failure and fire you.",1,Former Employee,Night Stocker ,"Colorado Springs, CO",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Somewhat,Depends on your attitude and performance.  You have to put up with some bad management  and a lot of change. Every day is different. Don't build up pto quickly.  Ppto builds up pretty quick. I enjoy my job most days.  Depends on who is on your team and thier performance. ,4,Current Employee,Sales Accociate ,"Derby, KS",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Great place to expand,"I like working at Walmart. It was easy since I stock. It has really good benefits but youll only have it within 6mo of working. Good pay, routine schedule (which I prefer). And I did like how you can take an hour break. ",5,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Fayetteville, AR",7/25/21,2021,7,25
It’s a job ,Management never helps out and always contradicting each other. They give you a set time frame for way too much for a single employee. Maybe at a bigger location it’s not a big deal but my store had one employee for 2-3 departments ,3,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Smithville, TN",7/25/21,2021,7,25
It was good great breaks also good discounts the bad the management,Also had alot of messy coworkers some people choose where they want to be instead of rotating but the good was the days we was fully staff and also when we had good people to help close.,5,Former Employee,Food Production Worker ,"Union City, GA",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Over work their employees for little pay,Management was usually unresponsive and lacked empathy when it came to training associates and understanding that people have lives outside of work. I had to take off work for being sick (I almost fainted on the sales floor from a fever) and was asked if I could come in two days later which also happened to be when I was using PTO that I had scheduled months in advance. Not many opportunities to rise through the ranks or learn something new. Suppressive work environment that often has management pick on people who have been there. Nepotism plays a big part in promotions. Schedules also change almost every day so you never have a set schedule despite what the schedule on the app says. ,2,Former Employee,"Support Manager, Department Manager ",CA,7/25/21,2021,7,25

Busy and unorganized ,"The job itself was very uneven. A normal day was never the same, one day you might be cleaning your assigned department with a simple task now and then, the next day you could be overloaded with work such as breaking down displays, doing pallets, cleaning multiple departments, and stocking items all in a single day. The job did well though if you learned how to take things one at a time things tend to go by quick. The management was a bit laid back, they didn't cause you trouble but at the same time they didn't do much beside hold the keys to cases within the store. Hardest part about the job really was the uneven and sporadic nature of the store, though the other employees did make the job a lot more enjoyable.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Yuma, AZ",7/25/21,2021,7,25
Only do what’s in job description and go home,"Would not recommend management sucks, wants you to go above and beyond for little pay and string you along for growth in the company just so they can hire an outsider for the promotion that don’t know what they’re doing. ",2,Former Employee,Store Associate ,"Conyers, GA",7/25/21,2021,7,25
They don't care about employees,"Not a great place to work. The only thing they have going for them is the rate of pay. Can't really find many places in my area that pay as much as Walmart does. However, they don't care about if you need a specific day off. You're just another worker that doesn't have a life outside of work and Walmart always comes before your personal life. Most managers have unrealistic expectations of work load even though most teams are severely understaffed.",2,Current Employee,Stocker/Unloader ,"Painted Post, NY",7/24/21,2021,7,24
Managers care less about anyone except themselves ,They Use you to do their dirty work. If you know how to do something that is a managements job they expect you to do it but won’t give you the pay that position makes.

You can’t find them when you need them. ,1,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Harrisonburg, VA",7/24/21,2021,7,24
Horrible work environment,"This location went from bad to horrible in a year's time. Management belittles the employees and are never satisfied.

You have no HR support, so you are on your own.",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Cambridge, MD",7/24/21,2021,7,24
Mediocre work place,Working here as time progressed many things changed not in the best ways. Management was a big concern. The company has been reducing jobs in certain areas or condensing them so the work load became larger without the compensation. Enjoyed my co-workers and thats about it.,2,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Aurora, CO",7/24/21,2021,7,24

Terrible company,Even terrible management at the perris Walmart. So not work it so there. For your own good. Upper management can't keep on the same page and take from other members departments. Real sh1t show. Don't follow their programs they set. Still follow their own rules or head managers once sweetie manager is gone. More do now and beg for forgiveness later mentality. ,1,Former Employee,Support manager cap2 ,"Perris, CA",7/24/21,2021,7,24

They expect you to not have a life outside of your job,"This place does not care about its employees. They expect one employee to do the work of 8-9 different departments.

Some stores are run better than others,"Enjoyed working at store #3241 in Glendale, AZ and worked my way up into management there. It is a well run store with high standards and a good competitive store manager. I transferred to store #2510 in Minocqua, WI and this store is poorly run with low morale and standards.

Company policies change often and there is no communication about them.,"After almost 12 years I have no faith in this company. The hardware has not been updated and the computers are horribly slow and the phones and drive through are very staticky so it's very difficult to understand patients.

reasonable paycheck,sadly 1118 is micromanaged and management misuses authority. They go by the butt kissing ways. Those that actually care and do the job get screwed those  that kiss up get the rewards. They pick people who speak up for themselves and others as scapegoats for accountability rather then those who should be. They show so much favoritism if your honest hard working and do a good job it only helps if your a favored one. Otherwise they will find a way of degrading you while complimenting you to hold you back. They only follow policies when it benefits them if it don't like schedules they require 3 week notice of request but change yours daily without you being consented. Positions given to people before open for others to apply. Salary managers team together no matter what like a silent code and use this power to bully others.

"Good for the money, but beware of the management ","TLDR: You will be disrespected by management regularly but the pay helps you forgetTwo years in and I make a handsome amount of money here as a part timer, very nice compared to other shops.Their scheduling is flexible provided you have ample reason to have your availability changed, mine being collegeWhile I really enjoy my coworkers and the work life as a whole, effectively my entire distaste for the company stems from it’s management. Despite working in an auto shop, it’s really a coin flip if your department manager knows anything about cars, meaning you’ll run yourself pretty good odds of having a retail experienced manager deciding how many cars to take in at one time, despite not knowing how long it takes to provide each service. For example, if there are two technicians available in the shop, a heavy workload of 4 vehicles being checked in at once isn’t very ideal to have done in time for the next appointment, however that’s the exact issue I find myself in often: overwhelmed and over capacity, and management will know it’s an issue and continue to overwhelm the shop to keep the money coming in. Not to mention you should always expect to be understaffedOverall you’ll need to be wary of managers that’ll use you more like a machine than a person because you will be miserable if that’s the case but otherwise you’ve got good paychecks and friendly coworkers.

Your hard work is not noticed and if it is you get NO praise, it’ll only make them use you even more. Favoritism is most DEFINITELY a thing in this store.

Quitting was simple because they do not even notice you worked there to begin with. My coworkers oftentimes were very cool and supportive, they were what made work worth while.

Bad Management Decisons,Unbelievably bad management decisions across the board. For example two of our managers once decided to have us pick oversized walks as our first walk every morning because they thought it would somehow increase our first-time pick rate… that isn’t how averages work. In the end one of our better team leads decided to step in and explain to them. Additionally our department would regularly decide to leave regular workers “in charge” who were often still high schoolers.

Very seldom is the right person picked for their role.  If you have any kind of personal issues to bad they expect you to put work first.  After 12 years as management with every evaluation good or better I was suspended based on rumors with no evidence.

There are hard areas to work in the store such as unloading, garden center in summer but I would never consider cashier as a difficult job. Sure you have to deal with....well every type of human walking the earth but keep in mind, it's nothing personal unless YOU make it personal.

It’s sink or swim. ,"Walmart’s biggest problem is that there are too many managers and no communication. In recent years they’ve condensed the number of managers but given them twice the work. The stress and confusion trickles down to the associates. You’re direct supervisor or “coach” is constantly running around the store trying to complete their tasks, while barking orders at their team but giving no direction. Some of the hardest workers will be the Team Leads who are just below the coaches but deal directly with the floor staff. They’re always stuck between a rock and a hard place by doing what is asked of them from their coaches but also helping and directly working with the associates. They’re constantly asked to be in multiple places at once. Nobody gets the recognition they deserve, and overall it’s a stressful environment. Expect to be understaffed most the time.

Scheduling can be wildly inconsistent. Favouritism runs rampant. And did I mention how understaffed most of building is?I can't say I wouldn't recommend it as a decent job to get you through a few months (or years), but it gets harder and harder to keep going as time goes by. As long as you're willing to either cosy up to the right people, or keep your head as close to the ground as possible and be consistent about your work -whatever that looks like for you, but Pro-Tip: don't go above and beyond unless you want that to be the expectation - it's doable.",3,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Herkimer, NY",7/22/21,2021,7,22

As a supervisor I was again threatened daily for not completing tasks such as unloading & stocking 2 full trailers with an 8 man team.

There's not much to do about the wall, but they should have a speed bump or a sign in place.

The store manager that was in charge before I quit didn't know how to effectively lead people and manage them which affected the entire store in a massively negative way. Everyone was only working for themselves so they wouldn't get in trouble and get written up. Very petty coworkers and very much like no one had left high school; the people who were management or in leadership positions were the ""popular"" people and rarely got talked to for things that the ""unpopular"" people would have gotten fired for.

Fast paced and tge associates,I used to love my job. I had been in management for 7 years.  Everything drastically changed and so did management.  I loved my associates they made it worth coming to work. I became stressed and overwhelmed. No time off not even my off days. It became too much. I had an a hole for a store manager.

It was the hardest decision I had to make but I had to go.,3,Former Employee,Food and consumables coach ,"Greenville, MS",7/21/21,2021,7,21
"Easy job, pay not really worth the stress, hardworking store manager","My job was in the online department. I learned many things while I was there, as it was my first official job. Sometimes, it can be stressful especially when you can't fulfill an order because we can't find an item. There are mean customers but there are more nice ones. Some people in management were horrible, they claim they would help us but everyone just seems more stressed because of them. There ARE other managers who are very helpful though. (There are different managers for different parts of the store). The job is pretty easy and straightforward, customer orders the item, I go find it, scan and wait for them to pick up. Hard part is when I have to work alone because the others were not available on weekends and orders would just keep coming in nonstop. Sometimes, I would have to work for 6 hours straight until someone relieved me. People from other departments sometimes, were not willing to help out because they think it is hard. When things go wrong, the supervisor would put blame on the employees. Some customers are just impatient and others are very understanding when you explain things to them. The store manager was switched and things are better; especially, when employees feel like they could easily approach the store manager with concerns about the other managers. You only get raise like 2% every year.",3,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Honolulu, HI",7/21/21,2021,7,21

No life and no team work,"Run please,  I used to love working for Walmart, and I've always been a hard worker I believe in working hard but this company now has unreal expectations because they are trying to run a skeleton crew they expect you to do more than as humanly possible and you could never achieve any possible goals because one moment you're being told to do 10 things then all of a sudden something else is coming up and you need to drop that task for another, it's only going to get worse. They keep cutting jobs and expecting one person to do it all. They also expect absolutely no excuses even if it's legit which I don't like making excuses but their expectations are unrealistic and it's only gonna get worse. I'll give you an example. For instants everyone in the company got a raise at least $15 an hour they only give cashiers $11 an hour and as the manager for the cashiers it was my fault that nobody wanted to cashier. You are expected to go out and recruit people even though the company is not willing to pay them what they pay everybody else in the company or even fast food places pay more for cashiers. That is just one of their crazy ideas. They have cut down no department managers everyone has multiple departments multiple duties that they need to take care of. So as a salaried member of management you are no longer a team it almost feels like it's a competition to get things done. Please the money is nice but it is not worth it ,you will not have a life you'll be constantly stressed out. Please please please for your sake run.

I had very very very minimal training (4 days) before I was given the responsibility of running the floor. My employees that I managed were more knowledgeable than me most of the time. Upper management was not helpful and nobody actually managed their department properly because management was constantly pulling them from their work to do freight (stock shelves). This left the front end (me) to staff all these other departments and keep my eye on them. Management did this because they couldn't keep their areas staffed because everyone hated them and their condescending attitudes. The culture was toxic as all could be.

They don’t care at all if emergency’s pop up and you need to call off, and will mark you for points anytime they get the chance.

"Not bad, but not great","I really wanted to like this job. Cart pushing got almost instantly annoying when I spent more time ORGANIZING the corrals so the carts could be collected than actually collecting the carts. I know people will see this and probably be like ""BuT tHAtS YUoR jOb!!!"", but my job is to COLLECT the carts, not organize them because next to nobody has the decency to put the carts in the corrals correctly. Most of the shifts I worked were either by myself or with one other person, so it was rather physically demanding practically running through the parking lot collecting carts. One upside was that I was able to listen to music when I worked, and being a cart attendant, interaction with customers was thankfully low. If you aren't annoyed by customers leaving carts everywhere, or potentially being scheduled by yourself on the busiest days of the week, then this job might be for you.",2,Former Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Hooksett, NH",7/19/21,2021,7,19

If i have to figure out what to do then they might as well not have their jobs because im basically leading myself. I was their for only 3 days at the time and was told i was too slow.

Poor Leadership,"As a young employee, once i was taken full time i was able to make a lot of progress in knowledge of the company and made myself noticed by management by putting in loads of overtime and contributing a lot to the store on a larger scale than your average sales associate. i was told after some time i would become a team lead; for awhile i was doing the work of one in the home department without the pay, and then they told me i was too young and didnt know what leadership was. it is unfortunate as i was beginning to enjoy it; but at the location i was at progressing in the company wasnt about how good of an employee you were and the knowledge you had. it was about who liked you.",2,Former Employee,sales associate ,"Toledo, OH",7/19/21,2021,7,19

Overworked,Walmart was a good place to work overall. I came to work to work and go home.

This made me feel taken advantage of and wore me out quickly so I sought other employment.,5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Charleston, SC",7/18/21,2021,7,18
Fun people and declining workplace,"As a cashier at Walmart, you will have to be trained on self checkout and the checkout lanes.  Depending on the day, you will be stocking the lanes and self checkouts with candy and the stocks. You will also be stocking the tobacco cabinets. This is all while having to helping the customers and checking the self checkout machines to see if they had broken down. This is compounded with the team leads trying to help, but they can only be so many places at once with only one on staff at a time. In order to get information on what is going on in the rest of the store, we have to go search out the associates that work in that department because the departments do not communicate between each other. For the most part, the fellow associates and the team leads are rather nice people, but the work environment is declining fast.",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Front End Associate ,"Glen Carbon, IL",7/18/21,2021,7,18
Fast paced and Stressful  ,"I was often left alone to do the work of a full team. It would get very stressful, especially surrounded by 10+ customers at one time. While I liked a few of the managers at my location, there were more that I knew I could not count on. Often had those managers pass by my department and see how busy I was but not stopping to help. Had to fight for my breaks and lunch often. Very lucky that my coworkers were all amazing people. Definitely could depend on them to get duties done on time. ",3,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Torrance, CA",7/18/21,2021,7,18
Too much drama ,"Managers choose favorites. You are constantly yelled at and belittled for things that might not even be your fault. They take the term ""customers always right"" WAY too seriously. i had a customer accuse me of literally hurting her child and i got yelled at for it even though i didnt do it. my manager said to me ""i checked the video camera and i know you didnt do it but still, the customer is always right and you shouldnt have put yourself in a situation where you can be accused"" it made no sense. Things like this would happen CONSTANTLY while i worked there. The employees were mean to eachother and the drama and gossip was way too much to handle. It was probably just my location but ive heard many similar stories from other employees. its a good first job but not something anyone should keep unless you can stay to yourself and ignore the constant ridicule from customers and employees. ",1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Farmington, MO",7/18/21,2021,7,18
It started off nice until they got comfortable with me working there,The managers or team leads don't treat you with the proper respect that a person overall should get. Starting the job no one really wants to teach you anything so as you go about your day there are coworkers that have to teach you. I enjoy helping others with finding things I need but I do not enjoy being disrespected.

"Go for a paycheck, more or less.","Walmart is a company that has very few intentions of doing anything with 99% of the talent they possess. This is evident in the frequent restructuring of positions above entry level to remove upper jobs and put them in lower jobs. Not only that, they ask you to submit suggestions/complaints on an ""anonymous"" website, when you have to log into the computer using your credentials to access. Management is very ""clickey."" Frequently do nothing but spend time in the offices in the back. The managers that are interested in you as a person look miserable on the job. The managers that aren't look indifferent to anything you say to them. Did it for two years and left. Walmart pays good, and ir traps people with genuine talent to do grunt work for their entire lives due to feeling secure with what walmart pays them. Ask anyone who's been there for over a year or two why they're there. 10 times out of 10 they'll say the pay. ",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Ebensburg, PA",7/18/21,2021,7,18

Very productive.,"While working there, I had noticed that most of the managers were very passionate about their work. Others would have others do their work for them while they sat around. During a typical day on the job, I would be in several different sections during my 6-7 hour shift, stocking at least 5 pallets a day with the help of others. I learned how to work with others and how the store ran behind the scenes. Everyone, or mostly everyone, was very kind and offered to help if needed. When an employee was injured, they were given a job that was easy to do depending on the injury and others were there to step up and help out. The hardest part for me was adjusting to having a job since this was my first. They really just threw me into it without much explanation and I ended up figuring it out mostly by myself. The most enjoyable part was meeting other employees and helping each other out so that all the work wasn't on one persons shoulder.

Unrealistic demands from people who know nothing about what you actually do. ,"What can I say?  Unrealistic demands from people who know nothing about what you actually do. That about says it all.  Telling people they have to “get with it or get out” does nothing for an employee.  Management is only concerned about their CYA, and their pay. They will hang you out to dry in a heartbeat.

It's fine as a starter job! They pay nice, and as part time you can usually get the hours you need. But some of the policies they have for full time (especially currently) seem asinine.

Horrible. Not worth the money. Do not work there if you have other options. ,"Horrible. The job was easy and very straightforward, but the culture at Walmart would only be worth it if they paid insane amounts of money. They take advantage of the fact that you get paid well in order to quite literally make your life miserable. The favoritism persists throughout the store is genuinely insane. I have so many examples of things that happened that should not have due to this favoritism. I was never allowed time off due to ""understaffing"" even though we had more than enough employees to let me take some vacation time. One employee was allowed to leave for two weeks, then not even a week later was allowed to leave for another two weeks. I was not allowed to go to Mexico for an important family event because November through December are ""blackout dates"". The boss would literally take one week vacations every month and November and December were no exceptions. Basically everyone I became friends with at this company left because of management. One of the managers was fooling around with his employees and was not dismissed even after this was brought up with the store mangers. DO NOT work for this company, the money is not worth it.

The best of the worst,"Pays more than most other retail stores, easy to get hired, and all of the jobs they offer are easy. Only problem is dealing with customers and management.

I was expected to do too much during my shift and would be treated like I was dumb if I couldn’t complete everything before my shift ended. A few of the coaches/team leads were rude and wouldn’t help when you asked them a question. The store lead wasn’t very nice or helpful either. Multiple times I asked questions to learn about something and was only put down and treated like I was a child. I was always asked to come in earlier or stay later yet after a while I was barely scheduled and ended up with 4-8 hours a week. When I put my two weeks in, the store lead was talking bad behind my back.

Miserable and not worth it,"Working the door is the worst position in the store. Coworkers are usually elderly and get shift preference for shorter/day time shifts. You literally stand all day and do nothing other than harass customers on their way out, asking to look at their receipt to make sure they aren’t stealing. Customers get irritated when you ask them to show it to you. It’s the most mind numbing, unproductive “job” I’ve ever had. You don’t get to socialize with anyone else that works there because you’re standing in a corner all day as the store snitch.

Do not work for Walmart ,I would never want to work for Walmart again just because of how terrible it is there. As I worked in the electronics section the customers would get mad at me for not having some particular items that they were looking for. People fail to realize that Walmart does not have everything that they sell online inside the store. Management there would never even get near me so I could basically do whatever I please and they wouldn’t really question it. Not to mention management didn’t really know what they were doing and some of them I’ve never even seen actually working or helping a customer.

Unfortunately if you started off with opportunities in your position you would be labeled that way always.  I think that’s the main reason I left.  The work isn’t to difficult.

I was doing custodian work and he was also i thought he was going to be great until he started being extremely lazy and the managers did absolutely nothing about it i was doing all the work and thats why afterwhile he finally got fired but after that i just gave up because i wasnt going to move up because of the politics within walmart. They have their picks and chooses. Anyway  far as the pay goes it wasnt enough for what i had to put up with considering me cleaning up after mostly grown people. The most enjoyable part was probably socializing i guess and making customers laugh they actually made my day go by faster. The hardest part of my job was when i had to of course clean the nasty bathrooms and they made me clean out the nasty trashcans outside in the parking lot with gunk and you name it that was at the bottom and also dealing with lazy people in general at the job that just cant clean up after themselves for nothing.

In fact, most other managers seem to dislike the eCommerce department, and I've even had managers flat out refuse to help me with something I was instructed to do by my direct supervisor. Not only that, but the equipment you're required to use is often either missing or severely damaged. When you bring this to your supervisor's attention, you're told to either work with the broken equipment, or download an invasive app onto your phone that allows you to use company software on it.

"Good coworkers, bad management. ","Coworkers were some of the sweetest I've met and always were on the same page. Sadly the page we were on is that we were mis treated, told to lie to customers, promised promotions that weren't available on hopes that we would ""work harder"" for less pay. Management jobs were pushed onto lower level associate's so that management could take time off and do whatever else they wanted.

Overall Good company ,"As far as retail goes, Walmart is about as good as it gets pay and benefits wise. Management in all departments  could really use some tightening up though. Favoritism is a very real thing in this store especially. They do not stick to availability. Hr does not explain things or try to help associates in times of need. Its a learn on your own kind of thing. Benefits really are good. Pto has went downhill though since they changed the attendance policy. You hardly earn any time unless you've been full time for 25 years. Yearly raises are laughable. But we get quarterly profit raises. Those are nice.

Dealing with customers is difficult.

The pay in management is really good, the people you work side by side with tend to be amazing and you build strong relationships with them. The homeol office is another story. It is a discrace in all honesty. Constantly changing structure and making it worse. They are making you try to spin things in a positive view to your associates when you know it's not right. They're very youngest and cheek. Honestly the only good thing is the people you suffer through with and they pay you enough to where you can't leave.

Stay aways false advertising,Walmart is a very toxic place to work at. If you are full time and been there a while they will start pushing you out... The image they want people to have is false and they do not treat everyone with respect especially if you have a disability. Management like to talk down on associates like they are children. The store manager only cares about sporting goods. The biggest problem is the unloader teams not getting things done but the store manager will baby them and will not hold any one on cap2 accountable also they will tell you they have flexibility for how's and shift they are lying if you can work on a Saturday they will cut your hours.

Makes no sense,Job was cut because of 11 minutes. They let you off if your work is slow.  A lot of young people that come in high or on drugs.  They do not explain benefits or how to do things on the computer.  Walmart did try to get people off for Covid.  But they did very little to prevent you from getting in the building with Covid.  They were supposed to ask you certain questions and take your temperature but that didn’t always happen.  ,1,Former Employee,Picker/Packer/Shipper ,"Fort Worth, TX",7/14/21,2021,7,14

Excellent Benefits....difficult work environment....,"Customer Host Position.  Checking receipts was difficult at times, customers would often be offended, and you'd take a lot of verbal abuse, often to the point where it was frightening.  I did expect to possibly be physically assaulted, customers would be very loud and upset, shaking a fist or behaving like they would push you.  The current policy has changed to one person working each door, (used to be 2-3 hosts) so not much back-up.  When more than one person worked at the door customers wouldn't behave so badly.  It's at this point I decided to leave, I felt unsafe.  The only reason I stayed about a year was because of the Health Insurance, benefits.  It was also a ""dead end"" position, even if you did a great job, there was no real chance for advancement.  It wasn't so bad 100% of the time, but often enough that I  felt I had to leave.  Store was often understaffed, so sometimes hosts didn't get their breaks.  Sometimes we had to participate in ""stings"" with Security, that always made me nervous.  40 Hours per week, on your feet all day.",3,Former Employee,Asset Protection/Customer Host ,"Norman, OK",7/13/21,2021,7,13

Other then that it's a really great job. You have so many benefits for part time and full time employees. You also get a sale bonuses every quarter and it can be really good bonus if store does amazing. ,5,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"National City, CA",7/13/21,2021,7,13

Lots of drama and terrible management ,Overall the job starts out at good pay but you don’t excel at all. You’re doing the same thing day in and day out and the benefits they give you don’t even start until 3 months in. You’re also supposed to get overtime pay which a lot of times is missing from your check. If you try and talk to management about it they don’t do any further research into it to fix it. Overall the drama and the constant problems from the job are just not worth it in my opinion. ,2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Greenwood, SC",7/13/21,2021,7,13
Unproductive and Very repetitive ,I am a part time worker working full time hours but not receiving the full time benefits.

Steady hard work with no advancement opportunities.,Steady work kept the week moving right along. Overnight stock in the meat department is physically demanding especially during the first of the month and every holiday. So pretty much always.

If I had gone to college closer I definitely would have stayed. This job is good for older people who want to work and younger people like in high school or college. The managers were the reason I hated coming to work, there are a lot of managers in each department and many ask you to do tasks that they were supposed to finish but didn't. I worked in Toys during the holidays and I mainly just stocked a little bit, cleaned up the aisles and zoned everything. I didn't work at the same time as my department manager so I never saw him except maybe on the weekends. He never left me any tasks to complete each day so it seemed like I was just walking around the department for hours until my shift was over. I was in many other departments doing things they needed help on especially on cashier when it gets busy. You have a certain amount of online training hours to do and this is done on the computers in the backroom. When asking for a day off, you have to request it at least 1 month ahead. Walmart is very strict about over time meaning that you won't won't work more hours than your scheduled unless you ask HR to schedule you more. They also stick to your initial availability when hired so make sure to have days off in your availability. If you don't they'll schedule you everyday.

Good people/bad management,The thing I loved most about working for this company was the people. Mostly coworkers that worked on the floor like me.

It’s alright but could be better,"I think that the management could use some reforming, I also think that they should hire people that actually work and not just anyone who wastes time because at the end of the day, it affects the store as a whole.

The way they hold people accountable is absurd and they put a huge work load on the people that can do it and let the slackers slack but the moment you cant do the work they have been pilling on top of you, you get held accountable and the slacker get to keep their jobs.

"Walmart: The good, bad and ugly.","Walmart was my first job, right after graduating from college. It was like working at a smaller grocery store, but multiplied. I started in the parking lot, putting away shopping carts. I worked my way up, by going inside. I moved up to Frozen Foods, and also worked in other departments. The work was easy, but all about physical labor. You had to unload sixteen wheeler trucks, then take pallets full of merchandise out to the sales floor and stock it. There was also inventory and organizing the freezers and your store section. I was twenty-two when I started, and thirty-two when I left in 2009. The job culture is pretty good, but if you want to make decent money, working your way up the food chain is the only way. That or leave for greener pastures like I did.

Productive and gives you a chance to move up in management,A typical day at Walmart is that you don't know what you're going to do. You can get pulled to any department and they'll give you a assignment. Team lead and managers don't really train you so you're basically on your own. When you do ask a question they answer with a slight annoyed tone which affects your mood.

"Unrealistic expectations, crass management, but coworkers are great","NOTE: The team I was on now performs a completely different function.Working at Walmart was a great opportunity for me, because it was my first job, gave me retail experience, and introduced me to what it was like, as an adult, to work 8-hour-shifts and deal with unreasonable people. While I do appreciate the opportunity it has given me, I cannot recommend becoming a day stocker at Walmart. That being said, Walmart doesn't even hire day stockers anymore, at least not at the destination I worked at. Anyway, Walmart sets stupidly unrealistic expectations for new and old workers alike. Often, you will find yourself working very hard, only to have your team lead come around the corner, watch you, criticize you, and tell you to move faster. It is very disheartening, especially when you feel like you've done well. Another thing these stockers do other than stock merchandise, sometimes, is to unload freight from the truck and sort it. This is not an easy task at all. If you are unloading the truck, you will find yourself exhausted and ready to go home half-way through the unloading process. Trucks are often between 2200 and 3000 pieces. Sometimes, you even have to unload TWO trucks. Being inside of these trucks is far less than ideal. You have barely any room to move around, often there are unknown chemical compounds on the truck floor making it extremely slippery and ruining your clothes, and your body will ache from all the heavy lifting and random boxes of dogfood and microwaves falling on top of you.

"The company itself is great and has a lot of potential, but how you view the company depends on your store. ","Generally speaking, Walmart is a great place to work, but it depends on your individual store. Some stores can be cliquish and divided. I.E. GM vs. Grocery, Cap 2 vs. Overnights, Cap 1 vs. Overnights. This is speaking from a salaried perspective, but if you don't have a Store Lead with a total store mindset then you will most likely get a disciplinary action at some point if your area(s) on the other side fail from lack of support or touring to teach from Store Lead to salaried manager (depends on the experience of the salaried member of management a lot of times. Those new to the Coach roles may not have been in the previous rotation for assistant managers and were exposed to salaried positions total store.) The store manager will tour with the Overnight Coach and Store Lead and possibly another member of management or members of management in the morning. Sometimes depending on favoritism, a new store manager will leave members of management out of touring because the store lead has favorites or does not like another member of management. Stores that have high turnover (typically high volumes) see a lot of issues usually stemming from overnights because of a lack of training; they are typically thrown to the wolves. Some members of management will work extra long hours to support failures total store while others will leave on time regardless. Working long hours to support the store by salaried members of management is not really appreciated and is frown upon.

Some can hardly walk they are so out of shape or just waddle around. The leads are only concerned about themselves.  You will be doing their work for them. They will tell you to move faster and let you know that you are not important.  Forget about getting a weekend off. Those days are reserved for leads and coaches.

If produce was suffering from shortage of staff, we wouldn't receive help unless our supervisor stressed it to them constantly. Management only cared about new freight being done, and does not look in the back rooms to understand that we do not have certain items.

There’s all the benefits you need, plus a generous amount of paid time off. Walmart is pretty lenient on their attendance policy and very supportive if there is a personal matter going on.

 A long day at work ,"You go in and see what side you’ll be working on and then go out to retrieve carts and you do that all day until your breaks & lunch, you make sure you have the essentials you’ll need to be working out there all day, and try to be careful because the management could immediately come out and be rude or tell you what to do in a rude and not helpful way and if you go up to them and ask for help they will either help you or not and tell you to find someone else cause they’re busy.

Pretty Laid Back ,"I like working here , I knew a lot of the customers, some of the managers were not that nice. I like having a flexible schedule. I had to work weekends.

A great place to work when your coworkers are good,"I loved my time at Walmart. It was tough work at first, with a lot of various responsibilities, but then I saw the degradation of my position over time to the menial. It was passable for the most part, and felt that management cared generally, but things became apparent when a manager 'technically' legally but highly Immorally purchased a firearm a customer had been waiting for months to purchase. Rather than getting fired, when I know other managers have been for much less, nothing happened because the manager was friends with the Co-manager of the location. I made great friends, but there are times like that that make it inexcusable to continue working for Walmart. ",3,Former Employee,Sporting Goods Sales Associate ,"Rexburg, ID",7/7/21,2021,7,7

I may just have to try stopping by in person anyway. Great people mostly, questionable management.

Poor management ,"Walmart is incredibly mismanaged. They will suck the life out of you and allow you to go above and beyond for little to no recognition. They will watch you and talk negatively about you and your job performance, without actually letting you know so that you can improve.

If I was working alone and it was a slow day, which was a lot of days for me, it was pretty boring and took up most of my day (I commuted from Janesville, plus the 9 hour shift), which is why I ended up quitting.

Good pay but lazy workers,"The pay is really good. However, I find that management overworks the good employees instead of getting after the ones who hardly do anything. I used to consider myself a happy person until I started working here. I am a hard worker, so when people around me are doing the bare minimum it gets really frustrating. Love my supervisor, but my ""manager"" isn't all that great. Most of management just bosses everyone else around while doing nothing themselves. There are only a few of them that actually work like the rest of us. If you are good at not letting people abuse your strong work skills, this could be a good job.

So much depends on who you’re working with,"The team makes or breaks the job. As management, I will say that yeah guys, we hear your concerns. Chances are though that we have no way to fix things because we’re like two rings further up a very large ladder, or we’re trying to fix it and something keeps happening to get it right back to square one (new hire turnover for sure).

"Mentally draining environment, unstable hours, poor management","You get treated terrible by management, they only care about getting paid. Where I worked they did not accept doctors notes for any illness, including contagious ones, so you were still required to come to work while sick/contagious or call in and use one of your points which you only get 6 of. The points system is terrible and you can lose your job very quickly, even if you only use them for emergencies, You get one point back 6 months after you use it. If you try to use PTO instead they will deny you for it and then you are forced to use a point in some situations.

They allow racist old women bully their minors.,This is a terrible place to work! The management barely communicates with each other. They treat their minors like trash and let older employees do anything they want while overworking the new ones. If you have a social life you won’t if you work here. They are on a ridiculous point system and will take off points only for employees they want to keep. The team leads are unprofessional and the employees team up with the team leads and create an uncomfortable work environment.,1,Former Employee,Fitting Room Associate ,"Millington, TN",7/6/21,2021,7,6
"Steady advancement, regular hours, good people in charge.",An employee is given an education to better himself to the company's policies and practices. Promotions will always be there if you apply yourself to the task and study towards the company. The work is sometimes hard but not undoable.

Fast paced work environment ,"Working online grocery at Walmart the days go by quickly, be prepared to take 20,000 plus steps a day if you are in a bigger store fielding many orders. All activities you do in a day are timed and you do have to attain a certain pick rate which is how many items you scan in and pick per order per hour. You have to work very closely with your department to get things done each part of the process directly effects another part of the process. Overall, it is an easy job to learn and it is repetitive so the job just becomes second nature, don’t really have to think about it too much. The handheld device you use tells you exactly what to do and won’t allow you to make mistakes by scanning the wrong item or wrong tote (it won’t allow you to move on if something is wrong).",4,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Uniontown, PA",7/6/21,2021,7,6

Easy job but bad management ,"Things got drastically worse the longer I worked there. I loved it for about three months after I started. When I finally noticed just how little they cared about their employees, it was a real eye opener to everything else. Management is terrible. They don’t care about you at all. They would rather lose hard working loyal employees than work with you and fix what’s wrong. They play favorites. It’s very very unfair.  We’re currently severely understaffed but they are cutting hours to save money. I struggle to get my lunches and breaks. Majority of the time I’ll work a 6-8 hour shift without a break. I get paid more by the hour, but because of recent hour cut, my paychecks are LESS than what they were when I was working at Subway for minimum wage. I love my position. I like the work I’m employed to do. I love my coworkers. Management brings the place down and makes everyone there hate it.

"The job is good, management is awful","I worked at Walmart Terteboro for few months and the experience was really bad. I worked as a cashiers and most of the supervisors were really hard to work with. They expected you to be like a robot and do your job, they would just walked and modeling around the store and would get upset when you call them or need them. Front End leaders/Supervsiors willl always forget about your break and sometime lunch, they won't forget about theirs but will forget about yours!  The schedule was something else, I submitted my availability and the managers would put me to work on the dates/times I was not available! Walmart also has a point system to penalize employees who call out sick or are late... not bad but if you ctually showing them you were sick or you had an emergency they would still penalize you. When you reach 5 points you are out. In conclusion, I won't work at Walmart again. ",2,Former Employee,Front End Cashier ,"Teterboro, NJ",7/6/21,2021,7,6

More so in the training aspect. Training is inconsistent and lacking.," Training could be beefed up. With so many employees there is always WAY to many hands in the pot at once. Its not uncommon for someone eles to to finish a task that you may have started,  as you can get pulled in different directions sometimes. Regarding auto center- it'd be very helpful to have a system and pattern to work by and consistency.  Very loosy goosy and hard to establish a rhythm with teammates and task at hand times. Lastly, I feel there are way to many people on shift at once. Its a cluster,  and when adding tasks to the workers, its hard to feel like you have a designated role which in my opinion creates a lack of purpose at times. Lots of standing around andanagers do not seem to care unless there is a customer directly involved, and even that being said, I've seen customers wait much longer than I certainly would, butnthan again they dont have much if a choice when their car is being worked on and they cannot leave.

"Good pay, bad environment ","They paid very well and having the paid breaks was nice. The people, environment, etc was not nice at all. It was super cliquey, judgy, and all about gossip. In addition, no matter how great of an employee you are or what things you did to go above and beyond, they were never recognized. I have also experienced this firsthand and heard this from other past employees: once you put in your leave notice, no matter how many years you’ve worked there, the whole team will turn on you and make your last days working a living nightmare.

"Get in, do your job, finish the task, and get out. ","Not every Walmart is the same, but the similarities are definitely there. Management can be little to no help and often don't show up when needed. When they are present, they offer little to no help. I work in the Online Pickup and Delivery department. Great job, loved some of my coworkers and the work was fast paced. There were days when we were struggling and our team leads were up to their neck in so many problems and the ASM and Digital Lead Operator were no help. I tend to avoid talking bad about anyone, but this team was literally sinking and sinking fast. I transferred to a different Walmart and things became so much better because they actually looked out for each other at the new store and knew what team comradery was. I stayed at this Walmart for a couple of months until I found a new job in a new field. In total I was there for about a year. TL/DR: Just go in, do your best and you will be fine. Do not expect for managers to really care about your well-being. You are a number to them, so treat the job as another task to tackle for the day and remember not to bring work home with you.

No pay. Overworked. ,Typical day is get there around 5:30 am. Get the milk order taken care of. Move previous milk order onto the staging platform. See what the workers from the night before didn’t do. Check the freezer to see if overnight did their job. Most likely neither one did anything. So pretty much play catch up all shift. Then the managers tell you to do about 15 other things throughout the day. Then they will go around asking people to come in on their days off cause it’s so far behind in the grocery department. You have the digital and stocking teams that currently at my location start out at $14+ Then you have my department that starts out at $11. It’s absolutely ridiculous for what we have to do.

Walmart environment is very toxic ,Managers just care about your production and every 6 month they will changed their policies. It’s all about production and reduction of breaks. You will be happy because the overtime.,3,Former Employee,Warehouse Worker ,"Bethlehem, PA",7/3/21,2021,7,3

I loved my coworkers,I loved my coworkers and manager but I didn't like the HR department the personal manager always seemed on leave or on vacation. Customers always suck but that's what you get with retail,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bellmead, TX",7/3/21,2021,7,3
The customers are the best and i love the interactions with them because it helps me feel alive instead of feeling like a robot.,Just dont let the managers misuse you and you will be fine.

"Decent Benefits, low pay for high expectations  ","I have been working at Walmart for almost 5 years, and has a lot has changed better benefits, higher pay, always changing technology. The management is always changing, so the chances are that if you don't like your current boss, they will most likely go to a different opportunity.  Usually, managers at this store or a hit or a miss, most of my bosses are pretty cool and nice, but it does help me that I almost say yes to everything. The most thing that makes me want to quit is that they recently got rid of department managers and replaced them with team leads, but then gave all the responsibility to the associates and gave me areas to be responsible for without even upping my pay. Walmart has also increased the hourly rate of grocery pick up and stockers to 15, but when they need more help, they will make you help them but then pay you the 15. Not as all bad though, the benefits include a dollar a day college( online schools only and limited selection), PPTO( protective Paid Time Off), PTO (Paid time off), no limit on how many non paid vacation days, 10 % most general merchandise and fresh food, and quarterly bonuses( only for associates who don't make $15 an hour). Not too bad of a job if you like working with customers. I highly recommend the job if you get a job in the areas such as Deli, automotive tech, stocking, and grocery pick up. Highly recommend this place if you want to go back to school and I believe you don't have to wait to start the program.  Look here for benefits https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/11/02/supporting-our-associates-10-of-the-best-benefits-walmart-offers",3,Current Employee,Hardlines Team Member ,"Burlington, WI",7/3/21,2021,7,3

Fun coworkers but bad management,"There will always be coworkers who make an agonizing job tolerable enough to stay. But overall management does not care about their employees. It's always about sales and the store first. They clearly pick favorites and hate having to assist with customer situations. As far as pay, it's good and steady but dont ever think you can have a second job or go to school while working here. Management will acknowledge your availability and STILL schedule you on day they know you cant work and get frustrated when you remind them. Overall morale is bad and they do nothing but hold poor excuses for lunch parties as ""appreciation"". ",2,Current Employee,Auto Care Sales Associate ,"Donna, TX",7/3/21,2021,7,3

Bad management ,They don’t care about any real life events in your life i could be saying and they say “make sure you put your time in when u leave “. They change your schedule without asking . They forget everything.  They make you go on lunch early because your understaffed even tho your already working 9 hour shifts as it is .

Job was wonderful the employees and management unfortunately were not. ,"The daily tasks were very menial and easy, the job itself was enjoyable and stress free. However, walmart management system is a completebackwards representation of what the company policies and standards strive for. When harassed or spoken to disrespectfully at work my manager or team lead simply told me to be the bigger person and not say anything. I find the way they handle work place tension is unacceptable and disappointing. Often times I found team leads sleeping in the ad office or dismissing things to make their life easier. The communication is by far the worst quality of working at walmart and basically... there is always another one of YOU, they do not mind replacing any person single handedly at the drop of a dime. However if this is a first time job its a great place to start. ",1,Former Employee,Deli/Bakery Associate ,"Goddard, KS",7/3/21,2021,7,3

Will not work with disablitys ,Will not work with giving reasonable accommodations if you get sick working there and then need them.

"No work life balance, Store/Co Management was awful which caused a hostile working environment ",I really enjoyed working for Walmart but the Wetumpka Alabama location management team was very unethical an there was no support from HR on issues related that caused problems which resulted in working in a hostile environment.

Eh,"Currently working two positions but only getting paid for one. Since there’s no -official- title in our system for my merchandising position I just get to be pushed to do whatever everyone wants me to do instead of taking care of inventory like I need to. I’ve been the only person working on said inventory for the past two weeks and the top stock carts have piled up in our little room. I love the people but we’re currently down 3 team leads and one backup team lead. Our manager went on vacation the same time everyone went on leave so I haven’t been able to make any requests to change my schedule or change my position. It could be worse but it’s already pretty bad as is. Always short on staff, we’ll try to hire new people and it’s like they’ll come in for the interview, see the long lines of people and walk right back out... I don’t even blame them though.

Wouldn’t ever recommend ,"-Not stressful on overnights, enjoy working alone  -Plenty of opportunities to change positions or go to a different shift.  -Ability to transfer to other stores. If you decide to move you can always have a job lined up since Walmart is everywhere.  -Discount card perk is nice but it's excluded on some food and that's a con. Discount should apply on everything across the board.  -Decent pay for my area WITH my shift differential, not anything to brag about! Overnights gets a 1.50 shift differential, I would not consider it decent pay if I was making only base pay of 13 -Plenty of opportunity to advance and receive promotions. Any of the management positions seem to pay really well. An assistant manager or a ""team lead"" as they call it apparently makes 65k a year. -Hour lunches are pretty cool, I like that.Cons-Everyone should be paid more and offered better benefits, 13/hr base pay is still really low and I don't understand how anyone could live on that.  -Health insurance plans aren't good. The deductibles on them are ridiculously high. I expect one of the richest companies to offer 100% employer paid health insurance for their employees.  -No shift flexibility. Should offer employees choice to work 8s, 10s, or 12s. I'd prefer to work 4 10 hour shifts, always dread going in that 5th day.Advice to ManagementJump in and help people working on the floor to maintain a healthy relationship and perspective with associates.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Starkville, MS",7/2/21,2021,7,2
Dysfunctional and disorganized ,"This Walmart has absolutely no structure, almost little to no communication between the managers, the managers are hard to find when needed, some managers lack motivation to assist in certain areas (mainly fresh). The pay is definitely unfair for example: OGP( Online Grocery Pick up) they get paid $16, over night get paid $17.50, Cap 2 get paid $16, and fresh (which is where I’m located currently )  gets $12. I feel as though we should be paid more for the work that is presented to us. Another thing is we are understaffed, so that causes problems for everybody when people are off or neglect no show up. That leaves us with a deficiency of worker and a lot of work. There is a lot more that can be said about this Walmart.

Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to cover all the days I needed off for my doctor's appointments and shots in my spine I needed to take and they refuse to even look at a doctors note let alone take it. They think they will find someone to easy replace instead of taking care of the people they have to stay longer.,2,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician in Training ,"Palestine, TX",7/1/21,2021,7,1
lots of tasks,you will never find a day not having anything to do. the goal is to stay cool and calm and focus on getting the jobs done. time flies by so fast because there is always something to do,3,Former Employee,assistant manager ,Ohio,7/1/21,2021,7,1
Fun workplace ,No complaints. I enjoyed my time here. I’ve worked multiple positions within this company and it was fulfilling each time. I would recommend this job as a good startup for young individuals.,5,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Orlando, FL",7/1/21,2021,7,1
It was ight,Work life balance was terrible. Staff doesn’t care about anything but themselves. There’s always some issue with you leaving on time even if it was their fault you’re late. The scheduling was a constant pain in the butt10/10 would never recommend. Pay is not worth the job at all. Overwork you and get mad at you for asking about your break time ,2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Atlanta, GA",7/1/21,2021,7,1
Poor pay with almost no benefits,"Throughout all 3 stores I have worked for, every place has had horribly unorganized management. No one communicates with each other. If you have a project or task, it's rare you'll be able to get through it without being dragged by a completely different manager to work on something else instead. The pay is above minimum wage, but still not remotely enough to afford a low-end apartment in my area. Despite earning PTO, management would rarely ever approve my submissions for time off, and even if they did, it would be a single day at most. I don't recommend working for this company. They do not understand that their employees need both a living wage and work/life balance. I was often schedules third shift followed by first shift, over and over.",1,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Tampa, FL",7/1/21,2021,7,1
Terrible place to work for ,Please don’t work at Walmart. The team leads treat you like you don’t matter. They lie and say that they are flexible but once you request time off they will decline it and not give you a reason. The only good thing there is the pay. Otherwise it’s a terrible work environment. No matter how hard you work the team leads are never grateful unless you are one of their favorites. This happens all over the store but mainly in the OGP department. ,1,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Dry Ridge, KY",7/1/21,2021,7,1
it was okay,"I was on the inventory unloading team, it was hard work especially in the summer time, unloading the semi load can be unbearable.

Walmart sucks,"Favoritism is insanely bad between managers and associates.

Easy job duties,"While the location  and pay were average. It stops there.  Lack of management support,  constant  "" jr high playground"" environment, supposed coaches/supervisors participating in the daily, round the clock chatter, and then proceeding to ""school"" the subordinates. Weak management and store directors that only take involvement on a minimal basis. Very disappointed at the work atmosphere. Also, very embarrassed that I worked at Walmart. They don't take suggestions from people with valuable work experience. Really wanted it to be better. Disappointed. ",2,Former Employee,AP Customer Host ,"Las Vegas, NV",7/1/21,2021,7,1
Management at the stores I’ve worked at love their chairs and offices more than helping,"This company makes jobs available for everyone, which is a good thing, however, management needs better training.

Very busy and you work all over the store,In the past 5 years working at Walmart has definitely changed. About 50% less workers and the same or more amount of work to do. You figure it out as you go because the managers are just as busy with not a lot of down time. ,3,Former Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Garland, TX",7/1/21,2021,7,1
Alright workplace at First,"Walmart is a okay job for starting off. It's my first job. Management can be very annoying at times showing favoritism and advancing wrong employees for career opportunities. The holiday and covid bonuses are a plus side. Discount percentage should definitely be higher than 10% and should be available on a lot more merchandise. This particular store is successful in bringing in profit, but it is also can be a toxic work environment, where they can be understaffed and treat employees poorly at times.",2,Former Employee,Janitor/Maintenance ,"California, MD",7/1/21,2021,7,1

Poor job description and AWFUL management ,"Walmart is greedy. I worked as a personal online grocery shopper. The description of the job is inaccurate in a way that misleads you into thinking it is an easier job. You only get paid $11.5 an hour! It is a fast paced job. For example, you are expected to pick 100 grocery items from the floor per hour. While there are some who can do it, it is always the same four or five of 20-ish people which means it is really not that easy. People quit every week! The HR only cares about the check from Walmart. HR works for Walmart NOT YOU. However, if you are a hard up for a job I would do it. But I would be looking for a better job while I work there. ",2,Former Employee,Personal Online Grocery Shopper ,"Jacksonville, FL",7/1/21,2021,7,1
You can not have integrity at this place of business ,"You are literally better off not doing your job while writing at walmart. While erotica there I recieved disciplinary actions for doing my job, afterwords I stopped doing my my job and had my manager come to me and tell me how much unnoticed he had seen in me and all I changed was NOT DOING MY JOB. YOU CAN REALLY GO FAR AT WALMART IF YOU DO THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT A JOB IS SUPPOSED TO MEAN. ",1,Former Employee,Assistant General Manager Retail ,"Lawrenceburg, KY",7/1/21,2021,7,1

Just like being in high school ,"Management could care less about you. I got cussed out by one for reporting a unsafe stacked pallet, drama is absolutely everywhere and your coworkers are extremely petty, customers are rude, you earn paid time off and protected paid time off for emergencies and calling in sick but you run risks if you use it and some managers are jerks and don’t accept your time off requests even if it’s for something important like a doctors appointment. The only good thing about the job is as a stocker you make $14, and overnights make $15.50, but with how stressful the job can be I don’t think it’s worth it. If I wanted the drama and stupidity of being in high school again I’d go work for a high school or something. It’s a good job if you are in high school and want to make a decent amount of money by stocking (as in joking around on the sales floor like most workers do) but if you are wanting a easy job you can slack off at, it’s not for you. Your other coworkers will slack off and management will get on you for things not being done and expect you to pick up the slack. So for warning, don’t be a pushover and let your coworkers or manager belittle you or make you overwork yourself",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,Illinois,7/1/21,2021,7,1
Good breaks. Bad customers ,Worked as a cashier. It’s not bad if your used to standing all day. Managers keep track of when your break time is and how long you stay on break. Customers may be difficult to deal with sometimes,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Delmont, PA",7/1/21,2021,7,1

StressFul work environment ,The Management has no communication they don’t give front end associates a voice they let customers run the store before them and also they don’t let you move up in a department they work you out of your schedule even if you have a set schedule. no seniority! they let new people with no experience become managers because they’re friends with managers they let managers date associates they are managing. No Professionalism!,1,Current Employee,Front End Service Associate ,"Suwanee, GA",7/1/21,2021,7,1

Wages arent worth it for the terrible management,"The work itself isn't hard, but management makes it feel difficult. Pay raises are almost non existent and pay equality is not a thing. Different managers give different instructions and everyone is overly critical. People are NOT treated fairly and favoritism is incredibly common. Don't expect honesty from anyone.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Modular Team ,"Hartford, WI",7/1/21,2021,7,1
Work pay ,Order selecting makes time go by fast incentive program could be alot better. Overall walmart could pay warehouse employees better and better benefits selfish of  company ,5,Former Employee,Order Picker ,Order selector,7/1/21,2021,7,1
Walmart does not care about you,"Pay is sub optimal for the stress they put you through. Every day you’ll wonder if you have a job the next day regardless of how good you are. They demand overtime every single week and you’ll get fired if you don’t comply to every demand. They don’t care if you’re family is sick or you’re out of town, you better figure out a way to come to work. Terrible work for college or school students, they will make you come in on your school days, so you’ll either flunk from school or lose your job. Spoke with hr about this and they said there is nothing they can do, even for a company that promotes schooling and furthering education. Work here if you have no life and enjoy working until the day you retire.",2,Current Employee,Processor ,"Brooksville, FL",7/1/21,2021,7,1

Pay is excellent,"but the management will just leave you on your own the whole time. you wont even see them. they hire a lot of people and just send them off into the store with no supervisor or anyone who you can get help from besides the other employees. the pay and benefits are great, but the work environment and supervisors are very odd. overnight shift is too weird and they dont lock the doors. ",2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Overnight Stocker ,"Oklahoma City, OK",7/1/21,2021,7,1
Depends on Managers and coworkers,"Overall, I rate Walmart a 3. I was happy with my coworkers as they were nice and encouraging. Some coworkers wouldn’t do their job but we had sections so the managers always knew who wouldn’t do them. We had carts of returns but sometimes it would be overwhelming and we would rush to finish as many as we could. If we didn’t finish them, we’d get notes from the managers telling us to take the job seriously. Night shift had no manager supervision which was a plus since we didn’t get scolded or overworked like the day shift. Managers were not very hardworking so sometimes we were expected to do their stocking and pricing. It would affect our job (folding, cleaning, and returning items) and in turn we would get scolded our manager’s manager. During busy times, get ready to become a cashier because there are never enough cashiers. To summarize, work at Walmart at your own risk.",4,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,4500 Fayetteville Rd,7/1/21,2021,7,1
"Good first job, but not good to stay","This job is great for a first time job especially for teenagers and the like. However, staying there for more than a year, it can get old super fast. You can do as much work as you can and they will not recognize or support you.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Albuquerque, NM",6/30/21,2021,6,30
Better than my old job,"It was pretty nice place to work at the neighborhood store until they keep you in the register the whole day… I have a bad shoulder problem so being a cashier was tough. I didn’t want to tell them because they wouldn’t even care anyways, and they did that on purpose. I saw other people switching from place to place but I was on the register the whole day. Which is a little unfair, that makes me wanna quit it. I hope it gets better. ",3,Current Employee,Front End Associate ,"Tulsa, OK",6/30/21,2021,6,30
Was okay in the beginning,Working at Walmart was okay in the beginning and then after we got a new store manager manager that's still kind of fell apart the manager didn't really care about his team a lot of the good workers left and then it just became like you don't want to be there anymore because we're overworked we are tired we felt very unappreciated,3,Former Employee,Sales ,"Buckeye, AZ",6/30/21,2021,6,30
Horrible management,Horrible management. Wanted to step down from management position for health reason but wasn’t allowed to. I was one of the hardest working csms they had and it didn’t matter.

Was able to move up in the company,"I started as a sales associate making just $8 an hour and in no time I was promoted to sporting goods department manager and then to electronics and so on. A few years later I was promoted to assistant manager. I ran a great team if associates that were more like a family to me. When I left I was making $45,000 a year. ",5,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Richmond, VA",6/30/21,2021,6,30
Overall pretty good. ,"It’s a good job, definitely room for advancement, the only catch is sometimes the managers have to like you to move up. Other than that work is good. There’s always something to do, and they really work with your schedule.",4,Former Employee,Personal Shopper/Pharmacy Tech Trainee ,"Port Isabel, TX",6/30/21,2021,6,30
Was Great at First Then Took a Turn for the wWorse,"At first it was a fun place to work. Nice management (they knew what was what and how to do things) and the co-workers were great. You felt as if you were part of a team and a family at the same time. As time passed, managment changed up and well thats when it went downhill. It got to the point where the new management didn't know what they were doing. You ask them questions and didn't know at all. They never kept you in the know of things or motivate you. The one I worked (the one across from IGA by Millwood Elementary) at didn't even follow its own guidelines. I've seen multiple people quit or get fired from the place. Honestly. If you think about applying there, Do so at your own risk.",2,Former Employee,Frozen/Dairy Associate ,"Sumter, SC",6/30/21,2021,6,30
Benefits vs treatment,"Walmart is a very interesting place to work if for no other reason than that the benefits don't even balance out the horrendous management team, the automated scheduling system, and corporate bureaucracy. The good mews is that even as part time you receive many benefits. Emergency paid time off, up to four unpaid days off every 6 months, you can get select bachelors degree for $30 a month and the discount is quite useful. They recently recently released all of the applications we use at work for personal devices as well. While this would normally allow for a much easier time, management refuses to allow us to use our phones unless there is no other choice. All of our work equipment is either damaged or has been stolen by other managers. The front end management does not care for there employees unless corporate is visiting. We are not allowed to leave from our positions under any circumstances until ""properly covered"". The biggest problem with this is that it is extremely difficult to get a cover, even if your right next to where they are supposed to be located. In order to find a manager you have to go out and find them. As for breaks or clocking out on time that will never happen. There have been instances where I took both breaks and my lunch the last hour of my shift, and ive had to stay over my shift for my last break. Clocking out on time is a myth here. Personally ive been held over my shift nearly 2hrs. We get overtime though so its all good right? Nope. If you hit overtime you get written up which goes on your record and can prevent you from getting promoted or transferring - more...",2,Current Employee,Asset Protection Host ,"El Paso, TX",6/30/21,2021,6,30
Decent work if your managers aren't a holes,"Review is based solely on the Overnight Stocking Associate position, and the work itself was bearable, but 90% of my co-workers were beyond miserable. I received little to no training and had to learn along the way. Despite me being new, I was given 5+ hours of freight almost every night, which would take me much longer since I was new and received no guidance. Supervisors were brain dead and expected me to go through all that freight in the amount of time it took the others to (people ranging from 35-60 who have been working there their entire adult lives.) Co-workers were old in age, but acted as if they were still in high school (drama and whatnot.) I'd imagine the experience would be different at another store, but at this one, it was miserable. Supervisors were rude, not at all understanding, lacking common sense and an IQ equivalent to that of a table leg. Most of my co-workers were miserable and would frequently engage in drama. In conclusion, the job was chill when you were alone not dealing with anyone, but co-workers and managers made the place a gloomy and miserable place to work.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Bellevue, NE",6/30/21,2021,6,30
Meh,It's okay work sometimes but don't expect to be in your own department very often. They pull associates all around the store to do all sorts of different tasks.

Hostile Work Environment ,Walmart is a horrible company to work for. Assistant Managers are allowed to make your life miserable. They always promote advancement but they pick and choose who can advance. It’s not based on hard work and skills. I had a hard time even walking into a Walmart after I resigned. I would get very nervous. Be careful if you decide to work here. ,1,Former Employee,Associate ,"Swansboro, NC",6/30/21,2021,6,30
Great place to start a career if you don’t care about work/life balance.,"I’ve been working for Walmart for over 13 years and if you really want to make some real money, there are a ton of opportunities for you.

Better than you've heard,"Wal-mart isn't bad to work for, but it's not much for building a career.

Not for the weak.,"I mean what can I say? Thankful for the job but for a billion dollar company not to have updated equipment used daily and a heating system for the winter and a a/c unit system for hot summer days and nights is beyond cruel punishment. The ""threats"" of giving out points when over worked and exhausted employees say they are leaving early for that reason among others is almost sla....yeah you get the point. Breaks are 20 min for lunch and 15 for break a few hrs after right before leaving. Most of those breaks are spent walking to and from the front of the building and or your car from the shipping area. But don't let me forget to mention OT is overly abused 5/6 days of working when you signed up for 4 and your Sat and Sun off along with the Monday (unless you are the weekend shift). I mean the coworkers who actually do come are usually enjoyable and we all attempt to help each other as much as possible but it's just the type of work and the constant wear and tear no real down time and home/outside life planning without putting the job security in jeopardy if you don't have the PPTO or approved PTO and vacation time makes this job overall a temporary stop for 90% of those who accept the always on going job offer.",2,Current Employee,Freight Handler ,"Sutherland, VA",6/30/21,2021,6,30

"Fun job, horrible company","If you want to wake up every morning and dread opening your eyes, Wal-mart is the job for you. The company allows you to miss work 5 times every 6 months. It's all based on a point system that is ridiculous and hard to work around. You have to work three months at your location to use any paid time off and even after that, it's an hour or even less.

Best retail store that I worked for,"Everything was organized and functioned properly behind the scenes. You clocked in, did your job, got adequate breaks and clocked out to go home. There was little to no overtime in the years that I worked there. The hardest part was when Walmart decided to change a bunch of policies and get rid of ton of jobs and products.

It's a team effort or isn't,"If we the people as employees do care enough to make our job to the best of our ability but some other people esp. management doesn't give a ... and just there for a salary paycheck, then the whole morale of the store as a team will fallout. I keep working hard but just one person or just a few that do care about the wellbeing of the store does, is not enough, that's why some employees literally walk away or not come back some work their bhinds and give it all get so tired to the brink of exhaustion, fainting, passing out (aye!) and the company neither the store ppl cares, so who the flood is running the store?!

Ever Changing Management,"For some reason the business model and management structure changes every few months to every year. Internal communication tends to be non-existent between Upper management and employee, as they expect all messages to trickle down through the ranks. Bonuses and raises depend not only on actual sales, but also attendance, so don't really expect either. They always seem to pull people from one department to another, and managers believe that job duties are ""whatever we tell you to do.""",2,Former Employee,Wireless Sales Associate ,"Amarillo, TX",6/30/21,2021,6,30

I was a Cap 2 employee,I liked working for Walmart. I just needed to be moved off of the team I was on due to a back problem and could never get them to do it. I blame management. I was too good at my job. lol I did like almost everyone I worked with and the environment was not a bad one at all. The benefits are ok on medical etc but the little added on benefits are great. My only complaint is that the discount does not apply to groceries or mark downs. That is kinda bad. I miss working there and would like to go back someday. ,4,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Tyler, TX",6/30/21,2021,6,30
"Overall, ideal for students, part-time workers and those who need a stepping stone job. ","Great for college students. A lot of work for little pay. Benefits are only good if you work full-time, but they don’t hire you full-time or give you a complete 40 hours. Don’t be late because there’s a point system where if you clock in too early or too late or need an absence, you get either half or a full point. 5 points and you’re out. 10% of all items except clearance and groceries (non-fresh) is not even worth it. Other companies offer way more. Expect you to cover other departments that are nearby if the other employee does not show. Use this as a stepping stone job, work culture is horrible. No acknowledgement of employees doing a good job. Management are not team players, they only tell you what they want you to do and 9/10 won’t help you even if it means you have to go find your own help. I started at $11.75 and took 3 years to get to a little over $12. Stay at this company for school and until you get a better job.

A Badly Managed Pile of Hot Garbage,"I've been working at Walmart for nearly three months now, and it is byfar one of the worst jobs I've had.  Not because of the labor itself, but because Management is probably the worst it could possibly be.  They blatantly ignore your availability, they give you occurrences for being sick, they don't send you home if you come in with a fever, and they don't treat you like a person or value your time.Considering I'm a minor and I NEED my availability to be followed, I have already gained enough occurrences to be fired.  I haven't yet for some reason that I don't know, but I probably won't mind if I do.  I told them I want a maximum of 25 hours a week, and they're scheduling me 30-35 a week.  Not to mention, they blatantly ignored my updated availability and are scheduling me on days that I specifically said I can't work.  On a side note, contacted management through the phone is almost impossible.  One time I got scheduled while I was on vacation(while my time off had already been approved), and it took me two hours to get in contact with a manager.  When I finally did, I didn't get an apology or any sympathy.  Instead the manager said ""Oh, I was gonna call you back but I forgot.""  and reluctantly removed me from the schedule.Overall, this is an AWFUL company to work for and you should avoid it at ALL COSTS.  If you want to be full time, then it's alright, but you have to deal with the garbage management.  Walmart is the definition of a bad company to work for, and shouldn't even be considered a last resort. ",1,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Leeds, AL",6/29/21,2021,6,29

Not that great,I work upfront as a cashier and we get paid the least out of every other department. The managers are rude and belittle you. They make it extremely difficult to move to another department. I was told i could move into another department and then 3 weeks later they hired someone else for the position… so i guess me having seniority means nothing.

Teamwork,"When the store first opened and was not open 24 hours, the day started with the Wal-Mart cheer.  At first, many of the employees became close and cared about each other.

General managers barely lifted a finger, would just stand and watch or knit pick little things. Other than that it was alright, almost always had over 30 hours a week. A little tiring at times having to fully breakdown the truck and then stock the shelves but I was almost always busy. If your not stocking then your zoning the shelfs or pulling items from top stock.

Instead, they blame everyone else in the store and punish them if they can't pick up the slack.

Worst job ever,"Where to even start, I'll just start with how terrible this job is. The management will treat you terribly, be extremely unorganized and then blame you for their faults. Time off requests are usually denied and getting time off for medical reasons are still questioned. Work life balance is non-existent and attempting to change your schedule to fit your work life balance denied without question. Oh and be prepared to work every holiday and every weekend. Honestly I rather be unemployed than work here again.",1,Former Employee,Customer Associate ,"Batavia, NY",6/28/21,2021,6,28

The good is you get paid well. The bad is there is never any team work. At least in my area i am now.,Walmart wants what is best for their customers and sometimes their employees. In the past it seemed as though Walmart cared more. I hope I am wrong. Everything seems to be changing. And not to benefit the employees. I want to hold on and see if things get better. ,3,Current Employee,"Stocker, deli/bakery ","Pittsburg, KS",6/28/21,2021,6,28
Job overall,This company is horrible they play favorites and it gets tiring after a while. The managers start drama and talk about people which they shouldn’t they should be leaders. they are lazy. I work at customer service only get paid $12 when people who barely deal with anybody get paid $14-$15 and hour it’s ridiculous.,2,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Charlottesville, VA",6/28/21,2021,6,28
Constant confusion,The staffing structure is bare bones with no coverage for call outs.  Management adds special programs and projects frequently and with little direction or clarity.  Constant conference calls announced with required attendance even on a day off.  Before you even get a handle on a program they are on to another one. No training budget so new staff is counted in productive hours on schedule.,3,Current Employee,Pharmacy Manager/Pharmacist-in-Charge ,Michigan,6/28/21,2021,6,28
Fast paced ,You need to be a people person and enjoy meeting new people. Pay is fair for the work you do. Easy work. You can advance fairly easy if you show them you are a good worker and have good attendance. A typical day at work involves checking people out and doing light cleaning around your work station. Have to be able to stand for long periods. The people I worked with were all nice and we all got along. There is a high turnover rate for cashiers because not everyone can deal with the public. The hardest part of my job was I can’t think of anything that was really hard.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Winchester, TN",6/28/21,2021,6,28

"Pretty decent pay, but I do not recommend unless it is a dire need. ",All the managers are terrible and they don’t care about their employees. The “occurrence” system should not be there and is very unfair to its employees.

Poor Management and Rapid Change with Increasing Expectations is Stressful.,"Overall not the worst place to work. Recent pay increases were nice, but increased cross-training and lack of store coverage as a result. While there are “some” opportunities for advancement, most often time management groups are very “cliquey”. If you aren’t “in” with the main group your chances are shot. I assume this to be the case in a lot of stores. I’ve seen many undeserving associates rise to management roles that perform badly. New system has led to consistent scheduling for FT employees which I suppose can be seen as a plus. No real incentive to perform well as once again if you aren’t part of the clique you go unnoticed. This has led to a surge in associates “brown-nosing” upper management and ruins the team work dynamic they preach. Also with the new hierarchy in place there’s a larger number of management staff that will still fail to come to your aid if you need it. This has also led to a feeling of “too many chiefs, not enough Indians” when it comes to completing even the most simplest of tasks. I used to love my job, but now I am unfulfilled and hate it. The only real reason I come back it seems is because of the relationships I’ve developed with my co-workers and some of the customers.",3,Current Employee,Electronic Sales Associate ,"Frankfort, IN",6/28/21,2021,6,28

disorganized,"Walmart has trouble hiring and keeping staff. There is also extreme favoritism and a clique like relationship among certain members of management that makes for an us verses them environment. Most of the store employees have to operate within their PPTO/PTO structure, but some among the elite are gone for a week or so every few months.

Decent job but not for longterm,"I worked at 2 different departments in Walmart over the course of 2020, and both started off okay but quickly turned into what felt like a mindless job with TOO many expectations and no opportunity to stand out. When I worked in the garden center they would try giving me like 3 or 4 different tasks to do at the same time and I would have to prioritize them, but then they would get mad at me for not having them all done at the same time as if that was possible. Working in OGP I wasn’t compensated enough for how painful and tiring that job was, ontop of the horrible stress. Pay was okay but not worth the work imo.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Crystal Lake, IL",6/28/21,2021,6,28
Unfair Job,"Honestly, I have been working here for like a month and am being treated very poorly by managers and coworkers. I'm getting paid minimum wage and they expect me to do other people's jobs, like STOCKING or CARTS or whatever (I'm a cashier). I'm not getting enough recognition and they only give me 30-minute breaks when it's supposed to be an hour. I'm one of the youngest workers at my Walmart so they have me do all the physical work. My coworkers ask me to do things for them all the time without any thanks. Getting blamed for customers stealing, Standing long hours, and get yelled at when leaning against a counter. Might just be my store, so I am definitely going to transfer ",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,California,6/28/21,2021,6,28

Consistent schedule/hours,"Management leaves much to be desired. Management talks down to associates on a daily basis and makes you feel less than. You are overworked and overly stressed. Management is not approachable at the store I work at. You can expect to stay on your feet for the entirety of your shift. You do get two paid 15 minute breaks incorporated into your shift, but if you don't advocate for yourself to get them, management will continue to push you to work through them. You get PPTO (Protected Paid Time Off) which is very nice and accumulates faster than regular PTO. I don't recommend working CAP2 if you are a parent and actually want to spend any legitimate time with your children or your spouse. I also don't recommend working CAP2 if you want to have any kind of life outside of work because your entire day is spent at work, from 2:00pm to 11:00pm.

Terrible planning and implementation from Corporate on down.,"Right now, Walmart is such a behemoth that it makes money in spite of itself.  “Low prices always” has replaced “the customer is always right” in the culture, and at the worst stores, this allows managers to be lazy, not do their jobs, and still make crazy bonuses, while the company continues to eliminate lower management positions in the ongoing quest for lower prices.  I work at the store, but I almost always shop with one of the few competitors.

"Don't recommend the company as a whole, but my managers were good",Worked as a floor associate for about a year and a half. My manager was great but the company itself is about what you'd expect.

You can do better,"When I got this job I really needed it and the majority of people were great there, but that has changed over time.Management at my store is bad to say the least. My direct team lead is great and communicates well, but he is one of the few like that. Most employees, including lower level management, are expected to do three or four jobs at a time and heaven forbid you don't meet expectations. My section is a combination of four departments in one and the vast majority of items are locked up, but they seem to think its adequate to only have one employee working that section for hours at a time without a break. I have been scolded for taking a lunch after seven hours when at that point I was locked out of the system due to not taking a break. Its normal to have a dozen customers staring and waiting for you to unlock something and ring them up all while the phone is ringing, online orders are coming through, and management walks through telling you that someone needs help on the next isle.The great workplace isn't so great here.I often reach my breaking point since we seem to be set up for high stress and failure.",3,Current Employee,General Associate ,"Hope Mills, NC",6/26/21,2021,6,26

I find out months later that I should’ve been doing training modules the whole time.  The management seems only concerned about their numbers.  Will ask you to do things to make numbers look better that are questionable.  If you want to move up or transfer I haven’t figured out what the secret is yet.

Horrible experience,"Working at Walmart overnight was a nightmare. The managers were super partial and disrespectful. They would speak to you in a disrespectful way and the work distribution was never fair. All my managers were Haitian and they gave non Haitians the hardest task and reprimand you for complaining. They would speak to each other in creole so you wouldn't understand but one can sense when they are the topic. They give tasks that were impossible to complete in the alloted time, and we often would have to stay back to complete it, and then they would tell us to 'shave' any overtime that was accumulated...shaving meant you would clock out at lunch and your lunchtime would last until the overtime was cut to 40hrs. We weren't allowed to clock out and go home to 'shave' the overtime because we would accumulate points (occurrences)5 points = terminationWhere points were concerned, they would remove points for the ppl they favored to save their jobs.

By almost the end, I was doing the same job as a cashier and the managers would not even look at me for a higher role because I was a little bit younger than the rest of them.

Poor management,The management at walmart doesn't care much for your wellbeing during your workshift. Especially if you work outside in extreme weather conditions. Your training will tell you to take 5 minute or longer breaks when you're overheating but then your manager will tell you to get busy doing something when you're trying to do exactly that. They go through workers like candy. Most workers will quit within the first couple months. Our department is always either overstaffed or understaffed. Management will sometimes send workers away to other departments when they are needed in our department. The job itself isn't difficult unless you work on overnight stocking or the cap teams. Digital Commerce department is easy to work in if you can look past poor management. ,2,Current Employee,Online Grocery Associate ,"Winchester, IN",6/25/21,2021,6,25
They tell you about advancement but there wasn’t any possibility at this location.,"Walmart informs you about possible advancements but this location made it difficult to move up.

Not worth it ,"Night management is a joke, they are unorganized and unprofessional. Be prepared to listen to them whine and complain like children all night long. They also will talk about other employees and managers. Management had unrealistic expectations. The biggest flaw was not having enough employees and zoning. The actual store manager wants the store to be zoned 100% before opening. So you want me to unload pallets of merchandise, put product up in the right place, throw my trash away AND zone the whole store? Sounds easy.. but trust me it’s like working in purgatory. There is no night security so sometimes customers just walk through the front doors because associates forget to lock the door after lunch. Yeah that’s not safe. Expect your feet to hurt and your body to start breaking down due to moving heavy boxes and pallets. Also nobody cares about night shift. During the holidays nobody did anything for us. We would come in and see that the shifts before us had little parties. We didn’t get showed any appreciation but nightcrew is the backbone! Other employees on different shifts blame everything on night shift! There is no accountability what’s so ever. Also associates will steal your food out of the break room! Stay away from this location unless you like stress. The best part of the job was the hour lunch and being able to clock out 9 minutes early.

Decent workplace but you are just a worker at the end of the day.,"A quick and easy place to work and get a job; which also means management doesn't see you as much of an individual but as more of a worker bee. Also, Walmart's employees and managers pride themselves on the many years they've worked there and tend to be quite a bit older in age, and that idea of seniority is rampant across the workplace. In this case it means nobody wants to work and argues about who does what. That doesn't work out well for the new guy.",3,Former Employee,Deli Team Member ,"Schertz, TX",6/25/21,2021,6,25

Not worth it,"This job started out fairly comforting and solid , but seized as corporate stepped in with huge changes every couple months such as hour of operations, dividing departments and floor plans that didn't make sense. As soon as we find a method that works for our department it is shut down. Management has so much potential, but ultimately seniority causes them to lead blindly. The division of teams is a joke!

Hard and dirty work. Long hours. Excellent compensation ,"It’s an old and filthy warehouse.  The jobs are mindless, repetitive tasks that rarely change.  No climate control in the warehouse (hot and humid summers and freezing cold winters).  Lots of micromanagement from home office that filters its way down the ranks. It seriously took an approval from home office in Arkansas, after filling out multiple lengthy forms, a process that took almost 2 months to complete just to move some rack beams up so pallets of 70” TV’s could fit in their designated slots. A six-year old could have solved that problem in 10 seconds. Tons of head-scratching policies that makes changing anything to make the job easier a nightmare.But if you are still reading, the compensation is worth it. Tuition reimbursement allows the employee to pay $1 a day for a legitimate, college degree from accredited universities.  401k match after a year.  Medical and dental and all the basics are about average.  For a job that does not require any skills at all, not even the ability to speak English, they pay well and offer some insanely good benefits. That’s the only way they can keep people working there.  So much potential to be a great place to work, just too much self-inflicted red-tape and bureaucracy to reach its potential. ",4,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Raymond, NH",6/25/21,2021,6,25

Management sucks at scheduling people to come in,"Screw working for Walmart. I hated it. Management doesn't know how to schedule people to come in to help other associates that are struggling with keeping up with the work. We were WAY WAY too under-staffed, over-worked and under-paid with little to no help from  other associates and management. Sometimes I was the only cart- pusher at the store at the time for a big store that is supposed to have a cart-pusher for each side but I was the only one there and I had to do everything by myself bring all the carts in for customers clean and sanitize the carts myself and then come in to do carry-outs when I'm supposed to be bringing carts in because they couldn't find any one else to come do it. And carrying/ lifting items too heavy for me like mulch bags and paver stones and other heavy items and not being able to get someone who can come help me. Not enough breaks. Not long enough breaks for someone like me who is tired and just wants to sit down and drink some water eat some food because I'm hungry and thirsty and need to smoke a cigarette because I'm way too stressed out because I have to do all this work by myself and don't have any help... having to bring all the carts in by myself with no help was too much for me to handle",1,Former Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Spring Hill, FL",6/25/21,2021,6,25

You will be micro-managed and corrected by immediate supervisors on a daily basis due to what apparently is widespread insecurities throughout the leadership team.  No preferable work/life balance and now the minimum expectation is you remain available 24/7, year-round.",1,Former Employee,Sr. Operations Manager ,"Bentonville, AR",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Paycheck advancements are a plus. Frequent bonus’s are great if you’re full time. ,Walmart is a company that is always changing what they do in order to better please the customer. That can be a good and bad thing for their employees. The pay is decent and the perks are good too. I don’t really have any complaints. ,4,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Lake City, SC",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Not very flexible and not reliable,"Front end is a mess most of the time, no one is ever at the service desk to help costumers, overly understaffed because of that they are not very flexible with schedules. Never pay attention to your availability. Self checkout areas are always messy. Breaks and lunches are usually given too early to keep people stuck working. Managers are only in the store when VP is coming to visit the store, that is also the only time where things are somewhat under control. Overall is a pretty good place to work at when things aren't all over the place. You will definitely have a different experience depending on you position. ",1,Former Employee,Stocker/Cashier ,"Winona, MN",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Only tolerable if you're part time,"Only a good place to work if you are part or just starting out. Management is incompetent and HR is a nightmare. You will not get paid a living wage and opportunity for advancement is not very likely, especially if you are not a favorite. The company is not very covid compliant and does not enforce policies on customers. If you are high risk, like me, you will not be taken seriously or have your health considered. This job has damaged my mental health severely. Get out while you can. ",2,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Ottumwa, IA",6/24/21,2021,6,24
One of the worst places someone could ever work,"Management is downright manipulative and set you up to fail. They are extremely quick to throw you under the bus and they are always out to get you. There is no potential for advancement unless you get in good with salaried management and even then, it’s near impossible. If you’re looking to ever get time off, think again because they don’t care at all what it’s for or why. You will be disrespected, degraded, and cut down every day and there is no recourse. The list of horrendous things I’ve experienced and witnessed working for Walmart is immense and can stretch on for many a page. If you value yourself as a human being and want rights, run far far away because they will squeeze the life out of you.",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Decatur, AL",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Not a bad place to work,There are some improvements that need to be made. Walmart is going through alot of change and it feels like they still don't know for sure how they want their stores to run.

No,If you’re salaried be prepared to be used and abused. Work/Life balance non existent. Some stores can be ok depending on your store manager. Most want you to work morning til night.,2,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,California,6/24/21,2021,6,24
Great place but too immature ,"The work was easy to learn and those who trained me were very kind. I was always helped out by staff when confused. I always felt included and was prompted an opportunity for higher pay within 2 weeks. Yet, the authority at my location was too friendly with staff allowing arguments and fights to go on. Also some equipment was broken. I was in between 2 altercations that had nothing to do with me as well as, almost hurt when my equipment was broke.  ",4,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Piscataway, NJ",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Decent entry level job,"The primary thing stockmen do is bring the carts in from the lot. We help customers put heavy items in their cars, such as TVs, grills, and old lady's groceries once in a while.",3,Current Employee,Stockman ,"Blaine, MN",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Horrible,"This is a terrible place to work. There is no way I would recommend this place ever again. There are too many managers who contradict each other. There is zero communication between them. You never finish your work, because you are pulled somewhere else. I was always asked to come in early because others couldn’t finish their work, and was expected to finish their work and mine. I was in so much pain at the end of the day, I was no longer able to function. I lived to do the best work for this company and I can honestly say, it wasn’t worth it. It has taken me 8 months to get the pain under control and to feel like a normal person again. ",1,Former Employee,Department Manager Wal-Mart ,"Dickinson, ND",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Lack of respect of GM and Managers,The current GM condoned the managers to disrespect the employees. You would be there a month or less and expect to be like Flash from DC when stocking the shelves. People would get sent home for being too slow. They even did this to 60yrs and older employees and ask them to trans to a different dept. The moral is very bad a here. ,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Savoy, IL",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Good if you speak Spanish and like being ,"I worked in the Deli/Bakery section of Walmart which included stocking items, making sure items didn't go bad, and sometimes I got to work in the bakery bagging bread or making donuts. If you are specifically given the job of baker or donut maker or cake decorater, then its a pretty fun job. However, doing stock/freight and working the sales floor is awful. It is a VERY fast paced job that expects perfection on the first try. The team lead or other associates did a horrible job ""teaching"" me how to do the job and then would get mad at me when I would mess up. Could be a fun job if you work with the irght people I guess. ",2,Current Employee,Deli/Bakery Associate ,"North Logan, UT",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Nice first job,The job is ok. You can’t ever get overtime. You have to cut it which sucks. We go through  periods of getting hours cut. There is favoritism here. You have to be on a manager good side to advance,4,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate ,"Columbus, GA",6/24/21,2021,6,24

Not enough pay,Get paid 11$ an hour to work long days in the sun and your encouraged to even work in rain as cart pusher. Then they don’t provide a good discount it’s only 10 percent.,3,Current Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",6/24/21,2021,6,24
If you have a disability don’t bother! ,I’m autistic and management knew. They took advantage of it. Unfortunately this company will hire if you have a disability but will not accommodate to help someone succeed in the company and will make them feel stupid. ,1,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Elgin, IL",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Decent place for first gig with hour long lunch breaks,"I had several people I was making less at my store than my position would make at another store so be warned of that. As a sales associate, the typical day consisted of just trying to get your stuff done while having to deal with the occasional customer. You would spend most of the day standing, only sitting for one of your breaks. You could take up to an hour for lunch (unpaid) so long as your tasks were done for the day. Management was a bit of a mess and underwent an overhaul during my time. Due to scheduling differences, I would not see my department supervisor for months, which lead to no feedback on anything. Coworkers can be a hit or a miss and the customers can be rude. ",4,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Layton, UT",6/24/21,2021,6,24
It's alright,"Been with walmart awhile now, but had to cut my losses at some point. It was hard on my legs as a sco host, standing in one spot, and I just couldnt take how people have acted during covid time.",3,Former Employee,SCO Host ,"Waterbury, CT",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Laid back but draining to work at.,"It differs from store to store, but at my store we were always understaffed because management refused to put more people on the schedule even though there were enough people to work. Worst part is, once you learn how to work in other areas besides your own, they will send you to work in different departments even though you still have work to do in your own department, which doubles your work. They expect you to get both done by the end of your shift. Sometimes they'll just send you somewhere and expect you to get it done without any training either so watch out. Management was terrible at my store, that's why I was sent all over the place to help. Great for a short term job or for teens. Would not recommend for a long term job though, you will get burned out.",3,Former Employee,Meat/Produce Associate ,"Catoosa, OK",6/24/21,2021,6,24
"Fast paced, bad management","A typical day as a cashier is pretty simple, you would probably get taught how to stock 82 (lanes at registers) and how to sort the steel in the back. CSMs aren't horrible but some of them are terrible. Just take your pick and stick with one of them. Even though there are s3xu@l harassment posters and stickers everywhere saying to report it when it happens, they don't do anything (at least management, security will kick them out) they just tell you to ignore it. fast-paced and work goes by fast. 2% raise every year",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Corydon, IN",6/24/21,2021,6,24
Great place if you can be management's lap dog,"Great place to work if you can get in with management. Although ""its frowned upon"" favoritism is the name of rhe game here.

Treated like a non-human,It was a very up and down experience. There would be good and bad days. The bad days outweighed the good days by a ton.

Typical big company job,"Team leads and managers just like to explode you, pulling you everywhere. A lot of micromanaging. You haven't even started or finished an assignment, and they keep interrupting you to do something else, that easily could've been done by them. They don't appreciate your ideas unless are theirs, and don't matter how hard you work, some other associate will come later and destroy it, and then no one will do anything to reprimand them. Pay is ok, but some get paid more just because their job description says heavy lifting, when at the end we all end up doing the same, is just a name, you all do the same.",3,Former Employee,Sale Associate ,"Clermont, FL",6/23/21,2021,6,23

Honest Review,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Most coworkers give you attitude or have an attitude for no reason at all. Keep in mind you're doing lots of work for minimum money. Customers are good and bad. You do know how to remain composed and calm because sometimes the job will take you there. I would say decent for teens.,4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"DeKalb, IL",6/23/21,2021,6,23
They didn't care about any individual.  They wanted to pay the least and have one work in overdrive.,"The culture is terrible. There is no caring about customer service. It's all about you producing output and the profitability of the company.  Don't expect them to recognize if you produce more, give excellent customer service and watch inventory control. They just don't care about any of those services.",1,Former Employee,Pharmacist/Management ,"Bentonville, AR",6/23/21,2021,6,23
They say they're family friendly but have yet to prove it.,"It's an okay place to work. Been working for Walmart for almost a year now. The pay is decent. It's enough to pay for my very basic bills, but not enough to provide a living if you have a family. They offer benefits which is great. They say they're family friendly but yet don't accept doctors note to excuse an attendance occurrence, and you only get 5 before you get fired. They fall off after 6 months, but having a child with a life-long physical disability, that comes with a lot of doctors visits. You're covered once you get FMLA after working there for one year. But that's if you can make it to the one year mark without getting fired. Some managers are understanding, but can't always bend the rules to take care of points accrued from absences. It's EXHAUSTING.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Newport News, VA",6/23/21,2021,6,23

Good place to work if you dont mind being treated unequally,"Worked there for 12 years and it only got worse over time. They say that you are family and they will take care of you, but that is far from the truth. You can tell them safety issues or any concerns and they are brushed under the rug. Although, they do update safety [after] someone breaks something or an issue arises. Policy? who cares, as long as the job gets done. Literally a numbers game, and only the numbers matter. You may feel welcomed and part of a team but the moment you ask a question about something they tell you to do, you are blacklisted and off the team. Management is a joke (dont get me wrong there are great managers, but far between). It is a club and a clique, and if you arent on the inside then you dont have a future there. Dont speak your mind or ever say 'No' and you will go far with the company. Chase the carrot they dangle in front of you and be happy with the crumbs they throw your way.

This Isn't That Place,"An absentee management team and constantly changing procedures make getting your job done in this place unachievable.

Want good management? A workplace with no drama? Walmart isn't the place for you.,"Management is lackluster, they do what they please without any repercussions. They openly talk negative about other employees or other members of management and even the store manager. I've seen management scream and yell at other employees for the slightest things. They expect more and more everyday without ever realizing there are a million things in a day at Walmart that can prevent one from completing their work. Regular employees tend to be on the younger side at a job like this so of course there's tons of drama that comes with that. One manager in particular has spoken racial slurs on more than one occasion and once upper management was notified nothing happened. Human Resources is almost nonexistent, sure, they'll help you with small things but when it comes to things like training orientation and information about insurance it's like you're completely on your own.

Will allow any and all work ethics,"Whether you are a workaholic who desires constant tasks to distract you from your peasant existence, or you desire a laid back place to hang out with your friends while doing next to nothing, Walmart can accommodate you. They have benefits after your probationary period and, if you show reasonable potential, you can find advancement easily. There is always something to do if you don't mind volunteering in different departments, but you will often find, either due to the general ""not my problem"" attitude that seems to prevail these days or to constant exposure to fluorescent lighting, many of your team members have a glazed over look of hollow misery. But I suppose you can find this just about anywhere, yeah? Management is extremely understanding of the idea that employees have lives outside of work and that ""life happens"". They have a very flexible schedule and can accommodate nearly every level of work you could ask for. Transfers and advancement available. Great team, but beware the clique aspect, as it is HEAVY here. ",4,Current Employee,OGP Associate ,"Springfield, MO",6/23/21,2021,6,23

8 years of high performing service then cut. ,"Walmart only cares about their bottom dollar. I worked for them for almost 8 years. I received stellar reviews as a pharmacist, made little to no errors, and co-lead my team with ownership alongside the pharmacy manager/PIC. I had a good working relationship with my techs and store associates/management. In the 2018 restructure I was “randomly” selected to be reduced to part time hours. I was told I could accept this job status change and pick up extra shifts as they were available. I would not have a predictable schedule or reliable weekly hours beyond 26 hours per week. Needless to say, I was forced to seek employment elsewhere. I am now living my best life as a hospital pharmacist. Don’t pay the high cost of Walmart’s low prices.

A fast paced environment for the most part,"As an overnight worker, it didn't matter what ""title"" you were hired for unless it was the online shopping section. In orientation they told us what we would be doing for the positions we were hired for, but in reality after the first few tasks, you come to learn firsthand and from everyone around you that you basically are a stocker, and only do the things you initially were told you were supposed to every now and then. Around 90 percent of the job was being a stocker, which honestly isn't that bad, but they should let one know before hand about what it is they truly will do, not once was it mentioned in the hiring process. Also management, or at least some of them, were very impatient with lots of micro management going around, having a lot of people stressing out and unhappy at times.",3,Former Employee,Retail Associate ,"El Centro, CA",6/23/21,2021,6,23
"Has potential to be a good job to work, but management can make it simultaneously harder and better","Worked over 5 years, started as a cashier and moved around all over the front end. My first store was solid, did struggle to get hours and had to deal with crazy schedules all the time. If that’s an issue then maybe it’s not for you, or make it clear that you have limited availability. Progressed work knowledge and had some opportunities but was stuck doing carts because the store never had enough cart pushers, especially in the rough seasons.Moved to a different store close to home. Worse customers to deal with right off the bat but this store utilized my knowledge better but lead to more crazy schedules covering for many people but at least I got 40 hours almost all year round. Promotion was slow for a while but a new manager that is still there gave me an opportunity to promote. Fortunately I had enough support from my coworkers that I had a decent supervisor promotion transition. CSMs were long rumored to be a rough position and I found out quickly why. Very demanding position with the number of associates you have to watch over as well as being the frontal “manager” that deals with customer issues. Even then I found some weird joy in improving and getting better. Once I became a Front End Team Lead that position for whatever reason was 3x worse. Basically being the punching bag for a large chunk of the daily problems and faults. Having to be responsible for the same stuff plus about 50% more workload with less staff than normal. Job quickly became redeeming at times to flat out miserable to the point where I felt like I couldn’t even function at home without worrying - more...",4,Former Employee,Front End Team Lead ,"Auburn, WA",6/23/21,2021,6,23

Overworked and underpaid. Constantly short staffed.

Managers provide little relief and prefer to put the work on you. You’ll constantly be criticized and forced to work shifts outside of your availability to meet “the needs of the business”. There’s a point system that is difficult to adhere to and if you call out managers will hold grudges and penalize you. They don’t accept doctors notes. PTO accrues extremely slowly and raises are given once a year at 2% so not much growth financially.

I feel the bonus pay makes up for the lesser pay than most companies though. If you do your job well, managers are usually very nice to you. A lot of them are also pretty relaxed most of the time which is nice. Hours are consistent so you won't have to guess when your next shift is. You get a 15min break for just a 4 hour shift which is very nice. But on the negative side, there isn't much room for growth.

Somewhat Lazy Co-workers & Poor Management,"They say pay, people, and/or enjoyment are the main reasons to keep a job. For my job, the pay is good and the people I work with are good people that actually work most of the time. The benefits are decent too, if you can get full-time and stick around long enough to get them. After 90 days, you get an in-store discount card, good for most taxable stuff.After 5 years in a couple different job codes, I haven't had enough of a reason to quit yet. However, management has been going downhill since I hit my first year. Most of the good ones are gone and their replacements are not usually very good. Biggest complaint about them really, is their memory. They say they need to finish some thing real quick, and be right back to help, then come back an hour or two later and wonder why you ask someone else. Promotions are kind of hard to come by unless you know somebody.Customers here are actually pretty decent and reasonably well dressed (for Walmart). They can a bit irritating at times but that's just retail.Overall, I would recommend working at my particular store.

Moving up ,Working at Walmart for two years as a minority they move people up from within but only when a position is vacant so hundred employees try to fill that one role. It’s unfair especially if you don’t fit a certain look or color. To succeed in a company that starts you off so low and climb to the top with no context other than having been working there is unrealistic.

Not bad for college students,In orientation walmart likes to tell new employees how easy it is to gain the experience to move up and get promoted when in reality its more about who is willing to suck up and act the part whether they actually do the necessary work or not.

Unfortunately when leadership throws the playbook out the window and skips corners the goal for success is now diminished by 30%. Walmart is invested in those who want to make a career and pays for you to go through training but it is rushed training. You are thrown back into your broken store with management that doesn't role model Sam's core values. Benefits are horrible if you aren't full time.

Cashier l,The cashier and I customers made for more than a boring day.

"Great coworkers, terrible management","I’ve worked in several Walmart’s and with many managers in my years with the company. Every store has its ups and down in associates, managers, and just how much can possibly be done that day. This store has nothing but downs, managers expect miracles from good associates and burn them out until they leave, bad associates have no expectations and just coast until they’re fired for attendance. There’s never enough people to do everything managers ask and never any understanding or sympathy from them. Overall I’d recommend not working here until corporate finally changes management here.

"Too much work, employees lack of skill or speed","The work load is too much, beside when you are good in what you do, they keep you doing the same all the time even when you request opportunity to do others things, beside you have to pick up, for what others lack to do, or don't have the skill or speed to reach out the goal.  ",3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Englewood, FL",6/18/21,2021,6,18
Great management,The work's pretty laid back. Most days are good and only suck if rude customers or bad workers put you down. Management is amazing for Walmart.

Overall great place to work at and the highest paying around here if you don't want a factory job.,5,Current Employee,Lawn and Garden Associate ,"Sidney, OH",6/18/21,2021,6,18
It’s an ok place to work. Strict sick policy is ridiculous. You can’t be sick or have a life. ,It’s an ok place to work. It was fun at times but there is a strict absence policy that is ridiculous.

Toxic disorganization ,"I wanted a part time job and they packed my hours as full as they could. I told them this doesn't work for me but they didn't care. Management is hostile and angry. The store is so understaffed that there are no people to train new employees and the cycle continues. This is a small town and the reputation as an employer in the community is awful. Just ask anybody that works there, and no one has a good thing to say about the place. ",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Employee ,"Terrell, TX",6/18/21,2021,6,18
Poor management makes the workday far worse than it needs to be.,"Walmart is a step-up from most service/retail jobs you might find in a small town, and generally speaking the work itself isn't bad at all. If you're an unloader you will be busy all the time and hours will pass quickly, it's quite strenuous and does take a toll on your body but it will also keep you in shape. Very fast-paced work environment. It helps a lot to find some friends on your team and joke around. Stocking shelves is okay, often very crowded but customers aren't too rude usually. Oftentimes you will be tasked with far more work than you can accomplish in your shift, and held to very strict deadlines for completion. Most management is out of touch with the tasks at hand, while other managers will jump in and help you, hourly supervisors seem more willing to help you out. However, salaried management is often out of touch, and don't realize how much time a specific task/department will consume, they will expect you to do the impossible all the time, and the more you accomplish, the more they will expect from you. If you're looking to advance, there are a lot of opportunities once you get a year or so in, but generally the workload of hourly supervisors is incredibly high, especially on CAP2. You will be expected to do even more impossible things and I have seen the stress of that position run people ragged. Maybe in other areas it would be better, but I wouldn't know. Usually very understaffed, basically running a skeleton crew, a lot of people will only last a couple weeks.

Fast paced but extremely stressful. ,"Like any corporation, Walmart could care less about its employees. While management differs from store to store, it’s as though they only care about themselves.

Busy always something  to do,"When i started working i liked my job i advanced fairly quickly from cashier  to dept manager. When i took the position  i got no training what so ever. They do stick you on a computer that gives brief detail  about the job. I learned most of the stuff on my own with help from my fellow dept managers near my areas. There was a definate click if you didnt suck up you didnt get raises nor noticed for a job done better then the rest when they gave out monthly award plaques. Even if customers ranted about you  unless you where a management favorite they didnt acknowledge  you or give you the customer appriciation pins. When i was pregnant i got no help at all and ended up working up til i was imduced by myself which was part of why i ended up having my child early. I also didnt get my raise while i was pregnant  or after because  i was too slow ..... The new store manager who took over avoided me and if i did catch him to talk to him he acted like i was bothering him and would talk down to me like i was not worthy.

And during the busy holiday season you are scheduled to work 5 days a week 10 hours a day and not allowed to take time off. The people here are very incompetent especially HR. Breaks are very short hardly anytime to get a break and they could definitely pay more (the pay isn’t that bad) and be more respectful and mindful of employees but it’s Walmart of course they could care less about the employees.",1,Former Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Gardner, KS",6/17/21,2021,6,17

Walmart store #3302,All managers and team leads have their favorites and don’t acknowledge the ones that actually work.They expect you to do your work and everybody else’s who can’t seem to follow instructions.It’s too stressful when you don’t have motivation from your Team leads just pressure to get the job done.,1,Current Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Houston, TX",6/16/21,2021,6,16
"Interesting, wouldn't work there again",I worked at Walmart for a little over a year. I didn't really enjoy it. From shifts that lasted way too long to managers and rude customers. Not my favorite workplace ever. ,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Austin, MN",6/16/21,2021,6,16
Don't do it. ,"Management will say one thing but demand another. They said i was doing alright one day, then I was fired the next. They tell you that you are committed to a role for 6 months, yet a guy from my training class got a new position in Quality after one month in. For those that can make it there, I wish then the best. However, not everyone can walk in there and perform well. I was in FDDS and to head to the break room is a 600 yard round trip.",1,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Cheyenne, WY",6/16/21,2021,6,16

I got along with everyone--I thought; but then found out later that some people didn't like me because I started out slow & needed a lot of help.,"For the most part, the workday is very hectic; at least it was in grocery self-checkout. I learned to watch what you say to who because it can come back and bite you in the butt, but I never said anything bad about anyone; I just complained about the schedule sometimes. Management was not a lot of help. There is no way to contact them when you need help. The workplace culture and diversity was very good. The hardest part of the job was being put on your own too soon. When you tried to get help from the other cashiers they became annoyed. For the most part, I loved my job. The pay was good and I made good friends.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Siler City, NC",6/16/21,2021,6,16

Just another job,"My time at walmart as a mod team member was what you would expect from any other job. We went to work, finish the previous shift's work, did our work for our shift, and got started on the work for the following shift as well. Companies like walmart hire way too many people who do not do their work and instead play around. They would do better to hire less people and pay more to the employees who are actually worth paying and keeping.",4,Former Employee,Mod Team Associate ,"Montgomery, AL",6/16/21,2021,6,16

There’s no such thing as equality,"Overall I don’t like my work experience here and I know I won’t be one of those people that stays for 10 years or longer, because one thing I stand up for is equality and that’s something that exists 0% at Walmart. Probably the only positive thing I can think of at Walmart is how friendly some of my coworkers are. ",3,Current Employee,Maintenance ,"Pocahontas, AR",6/16/21,2021,6,16
Excellent job with good benefits. I enjoy the team work and work ethic that WalMart requires,I love to work here it is amazing.. teamwork is a must and I could not be happier here.

Fast paced work environment with incredible lack of employees to run efficiently ,I have been with Walmart for 3 years now and it has been a rollercoaster. When I first arrived at my job I felt appreciated and I received a ton of assistance with on boarding and learning more about my position. As the years passed I have gone through several clusters of managers/team leads and no one ever stays long enough to actually make meaningful relationships. They have stopped hiring based on skill and now bring in just enough people to keep the place running. The days are long and most of the time I am working in a department by myself. If I could score my experience now it would be 1/10. ,2,Current Employee,Team Associate ,"Lima, OH",6/16/21,2021,6,16
Not a good atmosphere ,"Upper management was horrible. They forced me to train in and on something that wasn’t apart of what I was hired for, and said it was policy and it wasn’t.

Productive work place ,"Let me tell you the truth of Walmart, the Team leads are Lazy and very two faced. People are fake there. If you are a Stocker and are Slow, you're going to be talked about. If you zone slow, you'll be called ""turtle"" and if you hang out with the ""teens"" you're going in the wrong direction cause CAP 2 is basically just like High school and too lazy to even work. Let me remind you, you'll get crazy and rude customers all the time. ",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Phoenix, AZ",6/16/21,2021,6,16

Uncoordinated and unprepared,I was hired on as cap 2 last year. Within 2 days of working I had done more janitorial work than stocking work. Furthermore on the 3rd day we were out out there by ourselves and told to start stocking despite not being shown how it was supposed to be done. (This was my first job so I had no previous experience),1,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Valdosta, GA",6/16/21,2021,6,16
The work is easy and they're very friendly people,I I would definitely recommend Walmart is a good place to work. The people are very nice. They have always made sure not to overwork anyone and to give a good work-life balance they also have very good benefits and they're constantly striving to keep your health care costs in line. I feel like there are people there that have my back and watch out for me. Can't say that about every place I've ever worked.,5,Current Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Hartford, WI",6/16/21,2021,6,16
"Great company, poorly managed DC","The GM loves to create drama between members of management and just watch it unfold.  Poor managers are given opportunities if they play the role of ""yes man.""  Good managers are thrown under the bus if they challenge the status quo, use data, and attempt to make changes for the better.  Ideas are ignored.  You will be written up every single week if you miss just one metric and many times those metrics involve other teams and are completely out of a single individuals control.  The management turnover rate in this facility has to be the worst in the entire Walmart network.  I would not recommend working there under the current GM.  Very long hours.  If you work weekends you only work three days but you still put in 45+ hours over those three days.  A routine shift would begin at 12:30pm and end at 4:00am or later the next morning.  Then you had to be right back up there at 12:30pm.  By day three your brain is mush and they can tell you whatever they want.",2,Former Employee,Operations Manager ,"Brundidge, AL",6/16/21,2021,6,16
Great people and friends but nobody has a clue,"Idk where to start. Walmart has been good to me . But, I was at a way different place two years ago.

I could go on but I don’t want to",3,Current Employee,Meat and Produce Associate ,"Nashville, TN",6/16/21,2021,6,16
Poor leadership,"The leads in place work on friendships and not merit. If you're a friend, things will be overlooked and fixed, if not, you'll be let go. They don't enforce their own policies, neither do they provide adequate training to know how to handle situations. Many mixed messages are given. Leads do not communicate with one another or the employees. Overall, walmart was a huge disappointment for me. ",1,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"League City, TX",6/16/21,2021,6,16

Flexible hours ,"It was nice working here,the hours are flexible and the management seemed pretty accommodating. You also have the ability to move up the ranks pretty fast.

They're inconsistent in the policies they enforce or let slide. They talk down to you like you're nobody. Most every decision management at that Walmart makes revolves around how much of a bonus they will potentially get, Corporate Walmart should clear out all higher-level managers at that store and start over.",3,Former Employee,Cart Associate ,"Elizabethton, TN",6/16/21,2021,6,16

"Good place to work, but the schedule is bad",You have to be very motivated to succeed at Walmart. Their is a lot of opportunities to move up if you don't mind the schedule.

There is always more work than time to complete it. ,3,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Mission, TX",6/15/21,2021,6,15
CAP2 experience,"Overall, my experience at Walmart was terrible. I worked on the CAP 2 shift, which was stocking and unloading the trucks that came in from 2-11pm. We were constantly understaffed, and our hours were constantly being cut. If you want a full time position, make sure you get it in writing because they’ll say you can have full time HOURS but in the system you’re part time. That way they don’t have to give you benefits, and your hours are the first to get cut.Management was probably the worst part of the experience. They were always expecting you to do the work of 3 people and when work wasn’t done, it wasn’t reflected on their poor management style, it was blamed on the 12 associates that were there that night. We were told that we needed around 30 associates for our store in order to unload and stock the product we were bringing in.I spent too many nights working overtime and getting nothing out of it. I had told management I was interested in moving departments and for about a month they assured me I would be transferred as soon as they found my replacement. Finally, after about a month, I inquired to the store manager and he knew nothing about it and brushed me off, telling me that nobody was leaving CAP 2. The lack of care and communication among management was abysmal. I worked at the height of the pandemic during the summer of 2020. Walmart did the BARE MINIMUM to protect its associates. We were never informed when our coworkers were getting sick.We had a people lead who’s only job was to support the associates and all she did was make you feel like garbage for asking - more...",1,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Nacogdoches, TX",6/15/21,2021,6,15

Pay,Excellent pay and bonus structure for the mgt teams.  Upper mgt lack of knowledge of the real world in the field in the stores.  Middle mgt not held responsible.

Retail work in a high turnaround field,It's no secret that people who shop at Walmart come to look for low prices. But so many people come into the store that employees are often overwhelmed and find it hard to keep up. The store often suffers from lack of enough staff and scheduled times are difficult to manage for everyone.It's also hard for individuals to manage needs at home and at work in a timely manner because last minute changes do make it hard to change schedules in place.,3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Rochester Hills, MI",6/15/21,2021,6,15
Good Job,"Overall working at Walmart is okay, but it gets tiring after working there for over a year. If your like me and like change, Walmart is the wrong place to go.

And some of the staff pharmacists are great. But WM as a whole treats their employees like garbage. And store managers are lazy and incompetent. It's no wonder they can't keep fully staffed.

"Job was hard on my body, managers and customers and were always rude","I was a picker here for about a year and you are always on your feet running around often doing a lot of heavy lifting which they didn’t prepare me for. It is hard on the body but the pay is good. You get a one hour lunch which is also good but management is so confused on how to run a team that they run it into the ground. If you work at this location be prepared to be literally hit and yelled at by customers on a consistent basis without anyone even caring. Then when you go on breaks, be prepared to feel like your back in high school with the drama and feeling ostracized because your coworkers all think they are better than you. It’s very lonely work.",2,Former Employee,Picker at Online grocery pickup  ,"Cedar City, UT",6/15/21,2021,6,15

Customers.,"Used to be a caring company.   Now you are a very replaceable number.  Work loads have quadrupled in the past several years and the work environment is stressful.  Help for heavy lifting is hard to find.  They have reduced staffing and cut jobs.   Everything they give a pay raise across-the-board,  they have cut hours. So many people lose money.  Management has a tendency to lean on one to two workers to get jobs done,  while others walk around and play.  Honestly, they have grown so big, all that can matter to them is profits and share holders.  This used to be the best company to work with.

"Fast paced environment, workday goes by extremely quick. Pay is not bad. ","I was lucky to have a great team behind me at the OGP department in our store. Workdays go by in a flash if you give any sort of effort in the task you're assigned to each day. I usually would dispense to customers all day,  which to some is their most hated part of the job but I actually loved it over the course of my year and a half there.

You aren't rewarded for trying your best, only demanded more from while the people who barely do anything get the same benefits as you doing your best. I did not see any room for growth at the store I was at either, as I had several coworkers that were hired after me get offered full-time positions and promotions.

absolutely the WORST,"When I first got hired, I loved my job. it was so much fun. Sure every once in a while you got a bad customer but that happens everywhere. After a few months I had some trouble with a co-worker, brought it up to management and they did nothing. Management is what makes the job unbearable . There were so many time management ignored an concerns or problems we had until they were worse case scenario and then found a way to blame the employees for it. Team leads showed favoritism constantly and of course management followed behind. Constantly getting screwed over with schedules, managers would not approve days off even if you requested them 6 months in advance cause it was “your responsibility to make sure we have enough people scheduled.” They get upset with you when you call out or have to leave early even if you’re sick. I’m sure not every walmart is like this but too many are. Unless you wanna stick it out for the long term, I wouldn’t recommend.

You are inhuman and just there to serve as a verbal punching bag for any and all customer whims. No, management does not care.

Keep your expectations low and it's not a bad place to work.,"Didn't always get support from upper management but I know they have their own worries to deal with so I keep that in mind. My store is pretty good with working with my school schedule which is something that is very important to me. The benefits are very good for a job that requires no previous experience or special skills. I took advantage of their 401k and stock purchase plan which the company does match a percentage of both. Lunches are an hour long for a full shift and you get a 15 minute break every two hours, but breaks aren't always guaranteed. Management isn't always consistent with store policy which can be frustrating when assisting customers at customer service. I have worked with people who find promotions come easily, I personally have not had such luck. I believe building a strong relationship with management is the best way to get a promotion, don't expect it come just from hard work. Attendance works on a points system which is nice because you can track it yourself, and it ties into your quarterly bonus. I also personally don't have any trouble with requesting vacation time, paid or unpaid.All in all, not a bad place to work but I would not make a career out of it.

During my time there in order to finish my tasks for the day I would often have to put in 16 or more hours a day and skip all of my breaks and even then i would usually end up with several tasks not finished, I was often tasked with jobs that needed several people to finish it but was expected to do it completely alone, I was often expected to work my own department and then 2 or even 3 other departments that I was not trained in, customers would often come in and be very rude and demanding and often hostile if I was busy with another customer or task, I've had customers throw items at me and had several come behind the counter and help themselves which is a major safety and sanitation issue but due to policy I was not allowed to prevent such things from happening. Management would rarely show up when called upon and since I needed management approval to leave for the night I often spent my nights waiting for them to show up only to come in the next day and get called into the offices to be scolded for having so much overtime the previous nights. Many days I would come in at 5am and not leave till 1 or 2am the next day due to employees calling in.

"Fast paced, hard work no reward ","Walmart is a business conducted by people who are familiar with each other.

Push associates beyond thier capacity.,I've learned alot from Walmart from the few willing to teach. Management expects the world from you knowing that certain task can't get done. They increased the wage of stockers and put more responsibility on them so they call it even. They guilt you into working late shifts and coming in on days off when they need help and cut hours(even from full time associates who have been on for 20+ years) when it benefits the salaried managers bonus. If you work hard all you get is more work.

"It's Walmart, idk what you expect","This job sucks. The management comes and goes, and never sticks around for long before relocating. Some managers are pretty cool, others are rude and don't care much for their employees. If you do well at your job, you will be taken advantage of and worked 10x harder than the idiots who you will be forced to work with. They will work you to the bone, expect you to do the tasks of others who aren't doing what they are supposed to, and reward good, fast work with more work that shouldn't be your responsibility. The customers are awful and rude to you, and management is unwilling to do anything about it. I worked here for almost three years and there were still managers I spoke with often who had no clue what my name was or anything about me.

A good place to start but beware.,"Where do I start.This is a great place for a first job but it's not a place for long term growth. Benefits are difficult to get, and are more expensive and equal in quality to state care. Management and corporate both claim to be understanding and flexible, but policies in place do not reflect that. Example, I requested unpaid time off for a dr appointment and was denied. I needed my hours reduced to focus on my 2nd job and my schedule never changed, despite multiple conversations with the proper members of management. My coworkers treated me very poorly when I returned from an L.O.A, to the point of harrassment. Nothing was ever done to amend this. On top of being treated poorly, management is very poor for other reasons. People are pulled from all areas to work elsewhere , even specialized positions like cake decorator. So while you are working another area, your responsibilities will suffer. They expect 2x the work for the same amount of time.Resources are limited, and a lot of us are regularly deprived of the tools required to do our jobs, including handheld scanners and printers required for labeling product, and tracking inventory.

My hours were cut drastically over the next few months... eventually down to two days a month & someone who wasn’t HR nor my manager) ended up firing me for missing too many days. When going over my Attendence I found multiple mistakes in recording my Used PPTO on their end.  I got questioned on multiple occasions about my sick days called in.

Major staffing issues and poor communication from management ,"I'm currently an order filler, job isn't super hard but due to being heavily understaffed days run 12 hrs or longer. Can't advance b/c it will leave a department short handed so they rather hire someone off the streets to fill roles such as lift operators or dock workers. You have to accrue off days based off the time you work and it takes forever for that time to add up so you basically just put in for an unpaid day off. Also just gave the whole warehouse a raise except for 1 department (dry grocery 1st & 2nd shifts) and management didn't even give us an explanation as to why. In addition to all of this, I just went on baby leave and despite me setting everything up at least a month in advance, they waited until the day before my leave started to tell me I wouldn't get paid for it b/c I hadn't been there a full yr yet. Our supervisors are ok, but upper management has poor communication with workers & supervisors, which is making employees quit and go elsewhere. Honestly I don't think I will return to them from baby leave. ",2,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Monroe, GA",6/11/21,2021,6,11

Keep it short and temporary,"I have worked with Walmart for 15 years and a lot has changed. While the starting pay is much better, the opportunity for advancement is poor. They have downsized on the number of managers a lot so it will be difficult to ever get there. Also their priority is to get as much out of you before you get hurt, tired, or quit. Thus, my advice is to keep it short, and stay here only long enough to get a better job. The customers can be difficult and management in general is poor. Theres a lot of playing favorites. It's not so much how well you do your job, just how well you can get along with your boss. Managers often lack experience and knowledge. The overall training for most new hires is terrible. It's a sink or swim mentality and this causes massive turnover. Overall, you do get pay and should get enough hours if they like you. But just don't count on being there too long, if you are really good they will work you until you want to quit. ",2,Former Employee,stocker ,"Fontana, CA",6/11/21,2021,6,11

"The benefits are great, management on the other hand is questionable. ",The department I worked in definitely gave me forty plus hours every week. However because many people on my team had been there a while they did nothing but walk around or hide in the offices. Which left the new employees and people who actually wanted to work pulling all the slack. I also noticed the employees that worked their hardest and busted their butts got yelled at a lot more than the employees who did nothing or took two hours on their lunch breaks. More times than not I would be the only employee in my department for hours at a time and when I asked management for help when I really needed it I was told to “figure it out” even though most of the tasks needed a manager especially dealing with customers. Don’t get me wrong the benefits and pay were amazing but not worth working 12+ hours a day because management called in and other employees. I feel like they really don’t care about their employees and if someone did it was very few and far between. The especially don’t care if you aren’t in with their “click” there is A LOT of favoritism within the whole store and if you aren’t a suck up then you aren’t going to get very far.

If you can look past the unprofessionalism or embrace that type of work ethic, then this is the place for you.",3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,Virginia,6/11/21,2021,6,11
Na,Its a great place to work they pay great and everyone cares about eachother it real easy work i started in nov making 12 hour and now im making 14.50 i would recomend this job to anyone,5,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Greeneville, TN",6/11/21,2021,6,11
It was alright,"I worked in store fulfillment as a personal shopper.  Most days at the job were the same, arrive, get a brief rundown for the day and then start picking groceries.  I got payed well but there were times when it was very stressful due to us being understaffed",4,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Manchester, MO",6/11/21,2021,6,11
Great open door policy,"Loved working here. Just wish they would pay more for the hard work, especially knowing they're such a huge company. I'm sure they could afford to pay employees what they're worth ",4,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Tucson, AZ",6/11/21,2021,6,11
Overworked and underpaid.,Walmart sucks. Management sucks. We get overworked and all management do is bark out orders and complain but don’t lift a finger to help out.                 ,1,Current Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Blytheville, AR",6/11/21,2021,6,11
"No real chance to move up here, they keep you stagnant","I like my job but much of the management makes things more difficult than it needs to be.  There is no reward for hard work here, if you are a good worker, and a co-worker is terrible at the same job, you both will get the same raise.  I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking to advance through hardwork and get paid decent money.",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Norwalk, OH",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Worst Job To Work,"As long as you can breathe, they don't care. Had horrid management, and the schedule person was constantly irresponsible. They don't give time off when needed, call you on your days off, and will skip your lunch breaks. And lose official excuse notes given. Expected you to learn everything within a couple days or they'd either move you to another part, or warn they'd fire you. ",1,Former Employee,Deli Worker ,"Cape Coral, FL",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Worst of the worst,"I've never work for a company who treats their employees SO awful. They tend not to work with you. If your sick, you have to use time or get points. 5 point your out and it's so easy to get them. Management tend to have favorites and give them special treatment. If you have any problems, management tends to sweep it under the rug. The only good think about the company is you learn how to do different tasks in a short time.",1,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"North Las Vegas, NV",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Not a good place to work ,Walmart is obviously not an ideal place to work but on the recent years it has gone from bad to worse. The environment is ghetto and toxic and management is even worse ,1,Former Employee,Warehouse Worker ,"Sanford, FL",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Just a job.,"Nothing special about the job, pay is a bit low and the management is pretty average. They give you the option to work plenty of hours though but it’s draining",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Atlanta, GA",6/10/21,2021,6,10
"Overworked, Unethical values","Great pay but horrible company. Walmart allow discrimination. They ask you to come in for overtime to make you leave early everyday to scrub the overtime you actually worked for,, deserve. They will hold you accountable even though they needed the extra help. They'll definitely overwork, decent pay, under value you as an employee.",1,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Roanoke, VA",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Company to go get a check and leave ,"Coworkers make it better, but overall I didn't like working at Walmart. Management was pretty good. Most of them actually cared about what went on in the store. ",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Villa Rica, GA",6/10/21,2021,6,10
"Toxic work environment, bad management ","By far the worse company I’ve worked at over a 30+ year career.  There was almost no time given to ramp up on the tools, environment and culture.  Management was unreasonable.",1,Former Employee,Software QA ,"Sunnyvale, CA",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Its a easy pay check.,Its a paycheck. It's not and shouldn't be a long job choice. Simple work for simple pay. Don't get into the drama and do what you have to do to clock out and everything will be okay.,2,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Cullman, AL",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Management sucks ,The management team at Walmart 1007 does not have good communication. They wait until last minute and tell little to nobody about any changes coming to the company. You basically have to ask around to make sure what you are hearing is true and not rumors. ,2,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service/Online Personal Shopper ,"Richland Center, WI",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Loved my coworkers,"For the most part I enjoyed the customer interaction. There needed to more organization of breaks, etc. I left because my part time employee status had full time employee hours. It simply wasn't what I signed up for.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Mount Vernon, OH",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Management lacks knowledge ,"Pay wasn’t bad, job was repetitive. Brown noseres get promoted even if they barely do their work. Getting promoted or trying to get out of department is impossible if you are good at your job. Have to constantly remind management of issues to have them taken care of. Supervisors play favorites.",3,Former Employee,Picker ,"Bechtelsville, PA",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Good First time job,Good place to work for someone right out of school. Fair pay for what you do. Not someplace you want to spend you career unless you get into the corporate side.,3,Former Employee,Sporting Goods Sales Associate ,"Kannapolis, NC",6/10/21,2021,6,10

Like any other job,"Pretty simple stuff.  Depends on where you live.  Small town here so everybody knows everyone.  But, all in all, not a bad job to have. Pay isn't great, but can be circumvented by understanding.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Covington, VA",6/10/21,2021,6,10
The work,It is not a bad job start off as a high schooler or college student but depending on the department and your manager can play a role on how you enjoy working at the job.,3,Current Employee,Picker/Packer ,"Nashville, TN",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Fun workplace ,Nice work environment. Managers are pretty cool and the Walmart I work for is usually fully stocked. Been working here a long time. Clean bathrooms. And ,5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Miami, FL",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Fast and no holds bar ,Walmart is too big of a corporation to care about your feelings they try to sell theme selfs off as some sort of family but it's just a front the one good thing ill say about Walmart is that you'll make friends with someone you never thought you would.But hey they pay you and give you hours in this economy what more do you need.,3,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Prescott Valley, AZ",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Productive ,It was as flexible as I needed it to be. The job was not too strenuous and the other employees were responsible and kind. Management was satisfactory. ,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Houston, TX",6/10/21,2021,6,10
"Reliable employment, but poor treatment","Walmart is a good option for those seeking a new job with them. However, there are some very notable glaring faults working for this company. Cashiers have the hardest jobs in the establishment, and are also the least paid. The expectations for stockers are through the roof, and work loads are always much higher than a human being is physically capable of doing. Treatment from management can vary depending on where and when you work, but bear in mind that middle management tends to not be treated too well by the company or regional management, so you may expect to take some of the heat that they get. HR is a total joke; they only step in to assist employees in situations that they think could make the company look bad, or end in a lawsuit for them. Equipment that we worked with was always bare minimum quality, cheap, and half-broken a lot of the time. Obviously the pandemic was a trying time that's nearly in the past now, but when the lockdowns first started happening, other companies increased the pay of their employees, while Walmart on the other hand gave their staff a measly $150 one-time bonus. When times get hard, I can guarantee that Walmart is probably not going to be there for you. Unless you can get into management, this should only be a temporary job. ",3,Former Employee,Walmart Associate ,"Vacaville, CA",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Stressful work conditions ,"Worked here for 1 year.  You are monitored at all times and need to keep moving.  If you don’t keep up with their ridiculous time standards you will not feel motivated to keep trying.  Mostly young kids working as pickers.  I’m in my late thirties and struggled to meet work expectations, fell just short.  After a while I didn’t feel like I was really wanted there, just getting in the way of the younger, quicker employees.  And when I started we were working around 15+ hrs/day; it got back down to around 10 hrs/day after about 5 months, but you are there until they say you can go.",3,Former Employee,Picker ,"Los Lunas, NM",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Fresh Production ,"I worked in fresh Production for Walmart and overall the job itself is pretty good. It was simple, but fast paced the managers were always trying to rush and they didn’t treat their employees well at all in my opinion. The jobs ok though and it pays pretty well. ",3,Former Employee,Fresh Production Associate ,"Norfolk, VA",6/10/21,2021,6,10
No,"This job sucks, the hours sucks , they don’t care about you or how much you done for the company. Supervisor and management don’t care about you just a bad job to work at .",2,Former Employee,Truck Unloader/Stocker ,"Kearny, NJ",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Non productive and unappreciative,Non productive job. Very unappreciative long hours. A lot of lies told to keep production high.  Manager gossiping with associates about other associates ,2,Current Employee,Warehouse Worker ,"Atlanta, GA",6/10/21,2021,6,10
"Stressing,Understaffed and overworked ",Been working at Walmart for a few months I’m a part time teenager and I never get weekends off and sometimes no breaks. I work the front end and it is very unorganized and certain (not all of them) manger(s) should definitely not be one.,2,Current Employee,Front End Associate ,Arkansas,6/10/21,2021,6,10
Organization was good. Workplace culture was toxic. ,Overall the management staff did a good job opening opportunities for advancement. Work life balance could be improved on. Training was more hands on that virtual learnings. Workplace culture needed to be improved on. Some workers focused more on relationships instead of getting work done.    ,3,Former Employee,ICS Supervisor ,"Beaumont, TX",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Consistent hours and good pay,Worked with Walmart for a bit but it gets a little taxing when ur job position can change every other week.

Nothing ,Management should all be fired. This is the worst company to work for. Managers and Leads should all be coached for their terrible treatment of their associates. ,1,Current Employee,Cap Team 1 Associate ,"Booneville, AR",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Cashier,I get no hours and the only people who get hours are the ones who have been there for forever. They hire bus loads of people then dish out no hours then wonder why everyone quits after 90 days or less.,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Rome, GA",6/10/21,2021,6,10

Doctors notes will not excuse absences. They don’t care about you at all.",1,Former Employee,Personal shopper ,"Canton, MI",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Amazing benefits,"I was blown away at the different benefits available to an employee! College for a dollar a day, retirement, stocks, amazing insurance. Discounts card and there are TON of other discounts I receive because I am a Walmart employee. The job itself can be stressful because people in general are stressful. I enjoy my job and the managers at my store are very good. They are there for me when I need them and they always answer my questions and listen to my concerns. ",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Stuttgart, AR",6/10/21,2021,6,10

Easygoing workplace ,"Good job, pretty easy to do. Just a typical day to day working retail. Hardest part is probably working with different customers when they're having a bad day. ",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Canadice, NY",6/10/21,2021,6,10

Last resort ONLY,"The management is absolute trash, while the expectations are absurdly high but only for certain people. Blatant favoritism and no acknowledgment from any management about that fact. Good luck getting time off, and I hope you don’t go over points even if you have a valid reason (unless you’re one of the favorites or protected) cause you’ll immediately get fired. All the best workers are treated like trash and expected to pick up the slack of all the absolute garbage they hire and can’t get rid of. Absolutely avoid at all costs. ",1,Current Employee,E-Commerce Associate ,Maryland,6/10/21,2021,6,10

Dead end job but reliable,"The company is what you think it is. Room for advancement is limited, pay rates are often eclipsed by new employees, meaning your quarterly raises are nothing, you don't get more than 32 hours so that they don't have to give you benefits. Really the only positive is that it is reliable work, you're not going to get fired for nothing, if it can pay your bills its not the worst place to work.",3,Former Employee,Wireless Sales Representative ,"Morgantown, WV",6/10/21,2021,6,10
Was Fun At First But...,"I really enjoyed it at first, but over time, I was able to tell the managers had a bit of favoritism and the employees who have been there for a while, would kinda sit back and let the ""young bucks"" or newer  employees do all the harder work. We were also way understaffed and the time frames managers started to give us to do tasks were nearly impossible. All in all, it was the best paying job I had (overnight), but idk if the pay was worth the stress/feelings that eventually came as time progressed. ",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Yakima, WA",6/10/21,2021,6,10

Good co-workers but terrible management,I worked at Walmart as a stocker for 8 months and the management was terrible! I worked hard and got stuff done everyday but they wrote me up for productivity multiple times. On my Monday they gave me an unbelievable amount of work to do on my own with no help before the store opened and I managed to get it finished before opening and they called me into the office to fire me. Turns out they already had the papers signed and ready when I was on my off day and then they worked me hard and then told me I’m fired!!They would also keep my hours at 34 and not give me 40 hours so they could didn’t have to give me benefits. They only give benefits to their favorites that get to work there for a long time.,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Elk Grove, CA",6/10/21,2021,6,10

Depnds,if your mangment team trains you and yeah you might be fine but the counter store manager in a bad day you're probably not gonna last long one mistake from lack of training.

It was fine.,It was a fine place to work for. Coworkers were decent and management was okay! Depending on who your manager is! There’s a lot of favoritism! At one point there was girl who could just stand around and do whatever she wanted because she was the managers favorite! So I guess as long as you stay on managements good side and their favorites good side you’ll be okay! I have recently learned that when I was let go the manger told me his hands were tied and he couldn’t do anything to keep me but then kept two of his favorites from getting fired! So that was kind awful! But I’m so much better now and less stressed! Don’t get me wrong it’s a fun place to work but it can also be the most stressful place! ,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Batavia, NY",6/9/21,2021,6,9

Good Part Time Job,"I worked at Walmart for nearly six yeas. Walmart was my first job, and allowed me to focus on school while working to support myself.

"Cool, but Stressful workplace","have been at Walmart over a year in the pharmacy. Nice people, cool management, willing to work with my schedule never had a problem taking a day off.

Be clear on your work schedule and when you need a day off. Be strong and stand up for time off, nothing wrong with having a personal day or 2 but if you don't assert yourself they will schedule you whenever. The managers are really cool easy to work with. They are stressed too so don't take critique personally. Pay could be better we deserve more than the deli to be honest but I do enjoy my job and working for this company. Easy to switch locations too, if you do well you can move just about anywhere. ",4,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Fort Smith, AR",6/9/21,2021,6,9

Taking out most of our registers when a lot of customers refuse to use the self checks wasn't a great move either; but probably doesn't matter when we don't have anyone to run the registers we have left anyway.The pay is fairly good for retail.

Also because of my experiences and knowledge they have me help in any dept. they needed me including the manager position but still with same lousy pay.

There are also some less-physical jobs in the warehouse, although not many.You are expected to meet a ""cases per hour"" production quota. The unloader job is interesting, at least to me, but your production seems very dependent on how ""good"" your trailer is. You could have a great trailer (easier to sort, easier to move, small boxes etc) and easily meet production without trying hard. Or you could have a very difficult trailer (very mixed up, boxes fallen over and damaged, boxes very large and heavy) and even trying your hardest, you can't hope to meet production numbers.

Worst job I've ever worked in pharmacy,"Most corporate pharmacies today understaff their stores, but Walmart took it to a whole new level. They think hiring more clerks or technicians will alleviate the problem of a pharmacist being responsible for checking the data entry and final product for over 70 scripts per hour, AND counseling 20 people on new orders and giving a couple of immunizations - all in that same hour.The lack of concern for the safety and well-being of their customers and their employees is unacceptable.",1,Former Employee,Part-time staff pharmacist ,"Greenfield, IN",6/7/21,2021,6,7
The managers like to target people ,"Don’t work here it’s not worth it, the managers will treat you like your less than a human especially at the Walmart in even dale Ohio, dont be a cashier and decide to switch departments either because they will force you to go back on the register if lines are packed if you don’t go to the register they will coach you",1,Current Employee,Apparel Sales Associate ,"Evendale, OH",6/7/21,2021,6,7

Friendly co-workers; terrible environment and awful management.,"Not really anything too hard about this job. The biggest things to look out for is the weather and management. Don't get too hot or too cold and you will be fine. Management doesn't seem to have a clue about understanding our complaints. Some of equipment at the store is old and doesn't do very well. One specific problem is a door that is to be opened and closed every time carts are brought in is rusted and always comes off of the track. Mentioned this to management on several occasions. Goes in one ear, out of the other. They don't listen, they hardly ever pay attention to what we have to say. Forgets anything important. Everyone except management is super friendly and actually cares about what you have to say. Easy to talk to and get along with. Because I worked until closing, the easiest part of the job is when the store is getting ready to close and barely any people come in.

"Fun environment, easy to get additional hours by picking up shifts, advancement opportunities ","I enjoyed working at Walmart.

It's eh,"Job is good if you're into electronics. Your crew is what's going to make or break your experience.

Lack of support for customers ,"Management barely support the employees well, most of the time the shifts were understaffed and overwhelmed. As a employee I have to come to work and do my job, but honestly the job just didn’t support us back. Many times customer would get up with cashier when we had no control on how the shift were filled which made the job difficult and stressful. Working for Walmart can be a easy job, but the company has to make sure they have their employees back by not only hiring enough people but also filling the shifts correctly so that employees and customer are satisfied.

"Only good part of this job was my coworker, management was horrible.","I really didn’t like this job, at first I was excited about working here but as the months passed, I hated it.

I was still a minor almost working 40 hours a week on top of that I had school. I talked to my managers and he said that he couldn’t do anything about it. This job made me feel really bad about myself because of my managers. They made me feel like I was dumb if I couldn’t finish 3 pallets in an hour and a half and put the freight away in that time span. The overall experience was terrible and I wish I hadn’t had this type of experience with this job. I only worked here for 5 months and even before I started some people that have been working there told me that it wasn’t a good job.

I was blessed with great managers for the most part. The pay was good when I started in 2012 but today you can find a way less stressful job for the same pay if not more.

I refuse to feel like I have to start over. (401K for instance you have to pay in for a year before they'll match you).

Management has definite favorites,"It's a great learning experience although they do throw you into work without any training so, you have to be able to figure out how to do the job on your own. Enjoyed my job for awhile but unfortunately if you do your job well they will pile more and more work on you which would be fine if they paid you for doing jobs outside your pay grade and address associates not doing their jobs instead of unloading it on you. Management has definite favorites which is made quite obvious by promotions being given to people who aren't doing their job as an associate but are somehow promoted to a department manager position. When you are sent to classes to learn your position duties and are given an open book test at the end which you fail, should tell management that they obviously are not qualified for the position. But instead they are given a second try in house but instead of them taking the test again management has someone who knows what their doing to take and pass the test for them. Maybe it was just a one time thing to help a struggling employee¿? which I still don't find ethical, and management kept them focused on learning what they failed on the test, which they didn't! And if that didn't show you there's favoritism then the fact that management, and in this case the store manager himself, flat out took said favorite associates tests they had for new duties and new application software that were given when Departament Managers changed to Team Leads.

Career advancement is nil unless you've had prior management experience, despite that nonsense about three quarters of WalMart's managers starting as hourly associates. Most managers are poorly trained and have no social skills. They visit for hours, hide from customers, and do little if any physical labor unless they are department managers.

An above average part-time job for those new to the workforce. ,"As a Walmart cashier, expect monotony and a lack of challenge or mental stimulation. Every day is basically the same. Expect to feel fatigued by the repetitiveness. Nothing about this job is hard except for the learning process when you first start. Soon enough you'll realize that no one really cares about their work. If you happen to work at a larger store, you'll most likely get positioned as a self-checkout (SCO) host. It is a lot of pacing back and forth, monitoring customers to make sure they don't steal, cleaning machines, fixing scanning errors, and greeting customers. Being an actual cashier is slightly better IMO as you get to use the machine (I know, so fun) and use your hands. Bagging is essentially Tetris so that's cool. Sometimes you have to go outside and pushcarts because they ran out of the usual cart pushers. If you are lucky, they let you put the returns back on the shelf. I took as long as humanly possible to avoid doing the usual cashier-type work. The best part of the job is the breaks and lunch. Though you have to clock out, so maybe some would find this unappealing. I found breaks to be absolutely vital in saving myself from going insane. I only ever ran into a few non-so-pleasant customers, but certainly don't expect everyone to be friendly. Just be nice at first. If they don't comply, just become completely unresponsive. It works.   The managers at best case send you off to lunch/breaks on time and mention they appreciate your work. Worst case, you are stuck an hour past your shift.

Absoutely TOXIC.,"I worked for wapmart 7 years. 1 year in the beginning as an incredibly motivated cashier who wanted to expand my knowledge and learn as much as possible. They used my 'motivation' against me.

On the last week, everytime, they change your schedule to drop the raise and they make you restart the 9 weeks EVERYTIME so you NEVER get the raises. I worked 6 years as a customer service manager after they lied to me and forced me to work outside of my availability. My availability since I started original was 5am-12am. They told me that I needed to open my availability to 24/7. Then they switched me to overnights 10pm-6am and told me that if I didn't work outside my availability, they had no room for me. This was only on year 2 of me working there. I obeyed because I was young and thought this was a great opportunity, I was wrong. I am a ""go-getter"" and they closed every door of opportunity from me. Then there's the toxic work environment. My store manager was MIA 3 months at a time even though she was REPORTING THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS AT OUR STORE. The other managers are also a joke. They all act fake and practice favoritism. I watched them destroy the lives of a lot of my fellow associates as well, old and young. They have a high turn over - more...",1,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",6/6/21,2021,6,6
Fun and enjoyable workplace,If at the right location to suit your needs personal and professional this is an awesome place to work. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the public. Pay rate for hourly associate is more then enough. Benefits with employment extraordinary. I always recommend to family and friends Walmart as a great employer.,4,Former Employee,Remodel Crew ,"Sioux City, IA 51103",6/6/21,2021,6,6
Great place to work. ,"Walmart is a great place to work. Talk a out opportunities for advancement, spot of changes made around February and October. I’ve seen them cut office employees and bring in a staffing company as well as associate appreciation week we are catered so much food(depending on location). Coworkers support you, management tries to keep it professional You get the benefits, the schedule and stability of working for a huge company! Accountability and punctuality are the 2 matrix that my department was evaluated upon. I’ve seen workers lose jobs for productivity. Work home life balance is a gray area for Walmart, you are required to be at work for your scheduled start and stop time. If missed you have protected time to cover it but they were giving it out like it was going to hurt them upon the approval we lost PTO time. SO AGAIN lots of gray areas in work home life balance. Not many schedule changes. You get 1/2 breaks depending on how long you’re working. Celebrations are always in tow. OT availability during peak season( depending on department) 5 min grace period for clocking in. Once hired can’t move position for 6 months. ",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Coordinator ,Ohio ,6/6/21,2021,6,6
Equal opportunity employer. Fairly easy to advance. Positive attitude difficult but not impossible. You earn every penny of your paycheck.,Walmart has a lot of great benefits on their benefit hub. Most of them you won't know about unless you really search for them or a fellow associate tells you about them. My main complaint is they are always changing their way of operation. Every year they come out with major overall procedural changes. They also are terrible about cutting your hours. It doesn't matter if you're part or full time and they always cut them after a pay increase. Maintaining a positive attitude and smiling are superpowers because the associate culture is to constantly complain and whine about what a terrible company it is. Management is a mixed bag-good bad mean nice like any other company.,3,Former Employee,Fresh Production Associate ,"Mount Dora, FL",6/6/21,2021,6,6
anyone that works here should get a free pass into heavan,"the managers let you know that you are replaceable, treat you like garbage and do not care about the welfare of the workers there.     oppressive is the only word that fits.  only work here if you are hard up for a job.

Managers are always on you about something. They except you to be a superhero and get things done very quick ,I do not recommend this job . I work overnights and it’s Awful.

Pto,Walmart would be a great place to work if their management team actually worked with their team instead of forgetting where they started as employees too. The managers stand and stare instead of actually helping their workers who struggle under the enormous and unrealistic times that are expected of their actual workers.,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Athens, TN",6/6/21,2021,6,6
Biased/Lazy Management ,Management favors a few of the associates more heavily than others. The store owner made my time their uncomfortable and stressful. Very clear miscommunication between management and management and between management and associates. I personally was only taught how to do the work portion of my job and wasn't trained formally. I wasn't even taught any of the safety rules and instructions until I was injured. Would not recommend working there as long as this continues.,1,Former Employee,Digital shopper ,"Siloam Springs, AR",6/5/21,2021,6,5

Poor Management,"Where do I began? This place had the worst management. They refused to hire more employees when we were understaffed. We are constantly overworked and get placed into departments we are not familiar with, so you have a hard time answering customers questions about the product with in that department. The worst part is that any member of management is allowed to give orders, even though they are not the manager of the department you're in.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"San Jose, CA",6/5/21,2021,6,5

Good place to work ,"Good place to work, you always have to work hard, but there is a lot of flexibility, the shifts are 8 hours 5 days a week and you have two 15-minute breaks, one hour for lunch!  If you need a day off you can exchange it with a coworker and sometimes the managers change it, they always help you and it is a comfortable safe place, you have 10% discount on almost all your purchases, the managers and supervisors are flexible and treat you  with respect and generosity, the trouble is that you almost always have to work on weekends.",5,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Reading, PA",6/5/21,2021,6,5
Poor management,"The management(if you can even call it that) are just awful. They are lazy, often late, and in general have no idea how to lead a team! I work in online grocery pickup for a while, and then they fired me because of my ""non-walmart"" brand box cutter. And I don't mean like this had been an ongoing issue or anything like that, just one day pulled me aside, pointed out my box cutter, and fired me! I know the only reason they did this was to cut cost without giving me any of the benefits of an actual lay off. I'm not even the only one that they have done this too!",1,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Centerville, UT",6/5/21,2021,6,5

Overall job,The pay is okay now that is went up to $13 per hour but the way the managers treat you is unbearable. They expect you to do a task such as unload a pet food pallet in under 2 hours which is impossible. They fire people for little stuff such as clocking back in 5 minutes late from a lunch break. ,2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Beaufort, SC",6/5/21,2021,6,5

Management,It’s a tough and mentally draining environment to work in. Hours are extremely long and if you don’t have a good crew to support you as a manage it definitely kills the job. Work life balance is non existent for salaried managers and if you’re a good worker/manager you will get the short end of the stick on everything. ,1,Current Employee,Operations Manager ,Indiana,6/5/21,2021,6,5
Amazing place to work!,"It was a great job. I was proud to go to work every day, wearing the logo of a store I've known since I was a child. I loved greeting people, interacting with them, helping them, and making their day better if I could. The environment was great, lots of great people work there. Although, with every job, there are going to be things you don't like. For me, it was the manager of my department. He was abrasive, not a people person, and was negative in how he approached mistakes you make. He is a good manager but definitely needs to be trained on working with people in a positive way. It was solely because of this person that I chose to leave. Another thing that could improve is the scheduling. You might work until 7 pm, then be scheduled to work again at 7 am. If they intend to stand by the claim that their associates are their greatest asset, they need to be more mindful of the need for a constant schedule.",5,Former Employee,Automotive Service Writer ,"Springfield, MO",6/5/21,2021,6,5

Generally a bad job ,"The management is mediocre, and there was no manager at all in our department. The management do not supply enough equipment for you to do your job, and there is no ""training"". The company operates on a sink-or-swim method, and the turnover rate for associates is quick. The customers are generally rude, and the employees mirror the same attitude. The work environment is rushed, with little staffing and even less of an attempt to hire enough to fill the space. The few associates there were there for years, and are spread thin and emotionally exhausted by the end of the shift. Managers do not care or want to help in situations pertaining to anything in the department. They do not answer questions, and do not help customers at all. The company is also quick to fire associates without replacing them to balance the workload. Probably the most toxic work environment I've ever stepped foot in.",1,Current Employee,Electronic Sales Associate ,"Greensboro, NC",6/5/21,2021,6,5

Department manager,"They constantly restructure and do whatever they can to keep you in lesser positions and screw you out of any raises that come your way. I had to fight tooth and nail for a promotion and then I got demoted due to the ""team member"" restructuring. They do that every 2 years or so and if you're not one of the favorites then you'll be forced into a lower position. Upper management is totally incompetent and if you report them to corporate nothing ever happens.

Okay place to work,"Walmart is an okay place to work. Pay and benefits are good. The Company and (at least in the store I worked in) the management does not care about you. You get PTO based on how long you have been employed and amount of hours you work. There is no sick time, you must use your pto for sick days, doctors appointments and vacations.

"Poor management, underpaid, understaffed, trust me go elsewhere ",Trust me when I say go elsewhere because it’s not worth it. Everyone is miserable and all these changes they made are horrible! Management talks to you and treats you like you’re nothing but another number in the store. Too much work and no dept is staffed the way it should be with the amount of work that needs to be done. They make it seem like your life is to be walmart and Walmart alone. The benefits truly suck! You still get bills in the mail like you have no insurance because nothing is ever covered. Your coworkers and some of the regulars that come in are the best part of working here. You build relationships with people and that’s truly the only good thing there is to say about this place. Walmart now is not what Sam Walton wanted and I’m sure he tosses in his grave everyday knowing what Walmart has turned into. This place is ridiculous! They force you to work other depts that you were not hired for and if it’s a higher pay position you won’t get that pay and that’s not right. Don’t bother you will become just as miserable as everyone else in Walmart.

Depends on which store ,"I worked in the jewelry department which was slow most of the time. Management is fine but it depends on which department you're in. Depending on your store and department performance during each quarter, you'll get a bonus. New hires get paid 15/hr, but they never increased pay for associates who've been there for years besides the annual pay increase, which is only a few cents.

Problem Solver,"Overtime every other week. No support when you need help. People who have been there for years get away with murder, and the people that are actually doing their work and more get yelled at. Management doesn't have a backbone and will not stand up for you.   HR is a joke.. if you have to ever make a complaint on any manager or lead.. they let management know there is a open door case on that person through emails. All the good managers have left the company and everyone that is worth anything are looking for new employment somewhere else! No paid holidays anymore since we went from JET to Walmart.

Don't waste your time,"While working here, I was consistently required to perform tasks outside my job title. Many times when there wasn't enough coverage for the front end, I would have to act as the front end manager despite having no training and not being paid adequately.

Don't even waste your time at this company.",1,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate ,"Greenfield, WI",6/4/21,2021,6,4
Professional management training but always walking on egg shells because your job is om the line every day. ,"Training program for management puts you at a high level of management and teaches you how to handle any situation while staying very professional. The downside to that is that as management your job is literally on the line every day you walk in the store. And if they want you gone, they will find a way to make you gone. Promotion is based as much on kissing butt of the district manager as it does job well done.",3,Former Employee,Co-Manager ,"Madison, IN",6/4/21,2021,6,4

I wouldn’t recommend it,This job was terribly boring. You get up at 3am and clock in at 4am. All you do is scan product on the top shelves to see if they can come down to be stocked. You are surrounded by rude employees who wander off and do other jobs instead of their own. One of my particular team members was very condescending. I did not care for her at all.

Unhelpful and rude management ,"A typical day at work was rough. If my department manager was gone the other managers would take me out of my department and have me work elsewhere even though I had stuff I needed to do.

It’s busy, sort of like fast food when you are dispensing and it’s easy while you go pick the groceries. Dispensing for me wouldn’t be that bad if only there were more people working but manager decide not to put people back there when we need it or there are a lot of call offs.

Walmart: It's a Job,"Walmart is an okay company to work for.  The pay is decent depending on the area you work in, but benefits get worse by the year.  There is always work here as the trucks do not stop coming ever unless there is a natural disaster.  The workplace culture is horrible though.  Working at Walmart is like going through high school again.  The hardest part of the job is the metrics that the company expects each store to hit.  Walmart is extremely driven by metrics that are often very unrealistic to anyone that has actually worked in their stores.  The best part of this job is the hour-long lunch breaks and clocking out for the day. ",3,Former Employee,Entertainment Department Manager ,Florida,6/3/21,2021,6,3

Those days never got fixed so I got points. Then was told that I had to change my availability or I would lose hours was working between 30-34 at the time every week. Then my hours went to 0-25.

Bad Management and always under staffed,"Great place to work 5% of the time the other percentage is being asked to do 5 peoples jobs at once and your managers work then not getting paid for it. Being so understaffed you don't get breaks or lunches.Dozens of times I've seen associates asked to do duties above their pay grade with the promise of a promotion they never got. They'll abuse your good nature if you let them and salaried management are trained to make everyone else do their duties.With new changes to the management structure it'll only get worse as associates are now asked to do what previously was management duties so corporate can eliminate middle management jobs while not improving regular associates pay.Of course depending on which store you work everyone has their favorites so some people can get away with not knowing their job and just standing around or not showing up at all. The good 5 percent is getting to know customers, making friends and genuinely seeing the results of your hard work actually help people.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",6/3/21,2021,6,3
They want Walmart to be a company that you live an breathe an that’s not right. ,This is not a company you want to work at unless you are young an have no plans on do what you’d love to do.

Not the greatest place to work ,"I worked for Walmart for 6 months in the deli. Overall the job itself was easy but the management made it absolutely terrible. The favoritism makes it such a toxic work environment its ridiculous. One person gets stuck with  the work while other employees roam the store doing nothing all day or just not showing up to their shift at all. Even requesting pto was hard. Even after you've spent over a month earning just one day off for pto, you have to request it over 3 weeks in advance. Even if you did that it took them weeks to approve it and you have to keep asking. The only thing I liked about it was the consistency of hours, the one hour lunch break, and the pto(if it was approved) and the ppto.

Incompetent management ,It doesnt matter if you have 10yrs experience of dealing with cuts of meat or even a butcher they think you would be a better greeter at the door than to be placed in the meat dept.

"Stressful, understaffed, constantly disrespected","Managers generally didn't care about staff; moved them around different departments like ping-pong balls and took advantage of the hard-working employees by giving them management responsibilities with base-floor associate pay. Customers were generally nasty and hateful, and management wouldn't reprimand the behavior. Store was disorganized and unclean, and always short-staffed. Instead of hiring new employees they cut hours for already existing employees that actually showed up to work, which just made the store messier since there was only time to do the bare essential responsibilities.

With all of the changes that are being made, they are taking away more jobs and forcing a lot of people out of the door.

Moving upon was easy. Just do your work and you're compensated well. I was really looking forward to a future there until managers above me ruined that. Expectations for getting your work done were ridiculous and changed frequently. Mainly the time it took you to get done.

toxic work place ,worked there for 3 years.. i initially worked in fresh but they put you wherever they feel like that day. everyone there is lazy theres no incentives to work hard so no one does. everyone just gossips and talks while the managers are nowhere to be found. they only show up when the higher ups are coming to tour the store and then they just scramble and pile things up on you to do in a unrealistic time frame. its a never ending cycle.,2,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 2 Associate ,"Lawrence, KS",6/2/21,2021,6,2

Too much work and not enough employees,I started at one oclockin the afternoon. I started scanning items in the freeer that had to go on the floor. I had o put use by tags onthe items. This proceedure took a few hours. We then had tocollect the outdated items of the shelf. This items could not be sold.They were donated to the food bank. We then had to do donations and damages; I learned time management.

The customers,The cashiers do not get paid enough to deal with what they have to deal with on a daily basis. We’re the last ones these customers see and however their experience goes they will make sure you know whether it’s good or bad. Most of the time it’s bad and they’ll release the anger onto you when you don’t control anything else but your register. We get so much rudeness for too little pay. The schedule does not matter as well if you’re a cashier because you have to have a replacement before leaving and it’s unfair because we shouldn’t have to stay over our time because we don’t have one. We have things to do and quite frankly want to get out A.S.A.P but it never happens. ,1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Kalamazoo, MI",6/2/21,2021,6,2

Typically the day would consist of helping customers, zoning, setting displays and endcaps, helping other departments, and taking inventory.

Management was awful,"Management here, save for two or three of them, was the absolute worst. Lazy, ignorant, manipulative, unreasonable. If you are a hard worker, you WILL be carrying associates who flat out refuse to work. And do not expect to advance because of your work ethic or your value to the company. They don't recognize nonsense like that. The work is easy. Brain dead easy. But management will haul you into the office to chew you out for the dumbest stuff, whether your team could have helped it or not, so every day was stressful. I guess you can avoid the stress by being the kind of employee who doesn't try, God knows there's plenty of those and they never seemed stress, so maybe that was my problem. And they WILL screw your paycheck if they get the opportunity. I lost count of how many multi-year associates were making the same pay as brand new hires, so be ready to fight for every penny, and I do mean pennies.

However that all turned on its end after a couple months. Wal-Mart changes managment often which can leave your department in a mess, especially when they put someone over you with no experience. I taught 3 out of my 4 bosses how to their job. My store was pretty good with my scheduled hours when I changed availability, but I always ended up staying several hours late at least once a week because they were terrible with staffing. So by the end of my time there I was being bossed around by someone who did not know how to do their job, being berated by customers for things I couldn't control, was overworked physically and emotionally for staying late everyday I worked all with barely above average pay and no benefits.",2,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"El Reno, OK",6/1/21,2021,6,1

If you aren’t in the store managers “crowed” you get treated like you don’t matter. My assistant use to threaten to fire me for no reason quite often. Even would take my co workers hours away whenever he got irritated or upset. Would ignore us when we would ask for more hours due to the fact that we were full time and had bills to pay. Would completely ignore my department manager. Half our department missed out on our bonuses because he had all of us coming in earlier than Our usual schedules for months and didn’t take off any of our occurrences. We all got no bonus because he didn’t change our early ins and till this day that man could careless. I watched co workers cry because they were getting such bad hours and needed money for rent and he would give all our hours to friends he hired on or would hire people for our department then have them work a different department permanently. Leaving us with no hours. One of my co workers had Covid and was on leave for three months after she came back he tried to fire her for no reason before she could even start a whole day, of course she retaliated and kept her job but ever since, he would have her off half the week and then give her very few hours other weeks - more...",1,Current Employee,Electronic Sales Associate ,"Phoenix, AZ",6/1/21,2021,6,1

It's Walmart.,The Management team don't care about their employees and the team leads are rude. If you have any issues with another associate be ready to find another job because nothing is going to get done. The pay could be better but at least it isn't minimum wage. Your schedule is always switched around and if you have something come up you're not going to get your full hours. They rarely work with you if you're sick and the attendance policy is trash.

"Customer Service, Repetitive Work but Simple and Easy","The job difficulty is quite low. Once you're assigned a roll you simply follow that task structure until the end of your shift usually with two 15 minute paid breaks and a one 1 hour lunch. Its retail so its important to understand that customer interactions will happen and will not always be positive. Its important to try to help people to the best of your abilities or hand the task off to someone more capable of assisting the customer in finding items they need. Recently this task has become easier as simply suggesting the use of the app to the customer will allow them to mostly self guide themselves to items without the need for assistance. Making day to day operations much more reliable and simple. The job is quite repetitive another downfall of retail, so if you like constantly growing and exploring new tasks many people find moving positions around the company the best, but alas each job will eventually become the same job with different responsibilities.

Overall good place to work with good opportunity. ,"I was with the company for over 15 years. It IS a retail job. You work crazy hours sometimes and you will work weekends and holidays. It will be very stressful at times.. I truly feel that if you work hard and honestly, you can achieve anything you want with Walmart and overall I enjoyed my time there. However, in my experience I found that if upper management did not like you, they would find a way to move you out of the company, despite good performance, tenure,  etc. That would be the one negative thing I would say. But this probably happens in all jobs.",4,Former Employee, Store Manager ,Texas,5/31/21,2021,5,31

Like high school with mean teachers.,"If your managers are good, you'll be fine, but most of the stores are run like little fiefdoms with tyrannical managers whose only purpose in life seems to be to lord it over everyone with less authority than them. There'll be a few managers that spend all their ""downtime"" stocking, cleaning, and helping out, but there will be more that will just ride around on mart carts or sit in a back room and watch you on the monitors then complain about anyone they think isn't working hard enough. Whoever they like gets promoted, whoever they don't gets a triple portion of work, and bludgeoned out the door with ""coachings"" even if they've been handling the work of a whole team solo.",1,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Victorville, CA",5/31/21,2021,5,31
Management ,"Basically, the fellow employees support and help each other, when they can or when they're allowed.The different levels of managers that were in place when I worked there, was not clean nor helpful.

Absolutely nothing was done.",4,Former Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Auburn, WA",5/31/21,2021,5,31

Easy work,They don’t care about us there. You can work hard everyday and they won’t notice. They will tell you stuff like don’t think you too good because you can be replaced. The Walmart in Bloomington Illinois do not treat the worker the way they should. But there are some wonderful managers there that should be promoted. And some managers that shouldn’t be managers at all. And if you report a manager they will find some way to get rid of you with a cover up I seen it multiple times.,3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Bloomington, IL",5/31/21,2021,5,31

It was good when it was good and bad when it was bad,Walmart was a good place to work for the most part. You have to go to work with a “I came here to do my job and go home” attitude.

It depends on the management,"In my opinion your experience will be dictated by the management. If management doesn’t have there stuff together then you’ll have a terrible time because there no order or any kind of goals to work to. But if you have mangers on top of everything you’ll have a great time. Each store is a case by case I work at to different stores, which one I love and one I hated.

Great if you dont go salaried,"For a company that states one of its core values is respect for the individual, it definitely does not apply to everyone. Market team never gives any feedback. And asking to address any issue is like pulling teeth. When you become salaried they expect you to manage your business without ever allowing you to do so, all they do is micromanage. They will have hiring freezes then leave stores short staffed. No work life balance.

"Good people, terrible job","It got the bills paid but was mostly menial labor for a big chain company. I appreciated the folks I met here and a few of the experiences I had with customers, but I probably wouldn't give Walmart credit for those. Do what you have to do, it's a job that pays minimum wage.

The good is job security is there and the bad is the negative work ambiance ,There is opportunities to grow but also there is excessive competition to get a promotion.

Kinda unorganized and unsteady,"Work was very irregular. Some days, it was long hours moving freight at a fast pace. Other days, the hardest part was finding more work to do.

Hours also varied pretty heavily, and I never heard of any one getting more than 39 hours on a long week.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Tumwater, WA",5/31/21,2021,5,31
"Can be ""fun"" if you're a people person ","Management suck butt at the WalMart I currently work. No communication and pay is very low, especially for someone with responsibilities and kids.

Terrible management.,"I enjoyed my job until I started to realize how disengaged my managers were. The majority of the time I couldn't find them, as they weren't at the deli/bakery. My Coach reprimanded me in public twice in one day and had unrealistic expectations for the closing shift. My team lead, who was supposed to train me, did not. Instead my fellow associates taught me everything I know gradually. ",2,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Yakima, WA",5/30/21,2021,5,30
Horrible management ,If you have a problem you can not go to management. They will not give you the time of day. They also give you no training. They just throw you in your job.

Then they screw you after you are hired. ,1,Current Employee,Associate ,"Fowlerville, MI",5/30/21,2021,5,30
Flexible but Unfair & Disorganized,"This is a good job if you really need something flexible. With the mostly computer managed time off requests, ppto policy, leave policies, schedule availability, etc, you can work when you want & take off if you really need to. Good for students, not so good for parents though due to the lack of tolerance for sudden issues such as being last-minute decidedly absent, leaving early, coming in late. I do not recommend any more than 2 years in this place - 1yr would probably be ideal. I've been here for over 3.The unfairness part takes place in multiple ways. For example, giving us ""holiday pay"" around Christmas time when it's actually just taking our earned PTO against our will & paying it out to us instead. Until they were relatively recently investigated and found guilty for it, they were known to fire people who even just said the word ""union."" Let alone form one. I heard about this months before they were found guilty, but wasn't sure whether to believe it at first. Also has poor management due to severe lack of communication. Changes don't get communicated very well, and managers are always telling associates different orders & information. This leaves everyone confused and overwhelmed with wondering which orders they should follow or whose information is correct. There's a lot more, but these are a few examples.",3,Current Employee,AP Customer Specialist ,Arkansas,5/30/21,2021,5,30
Rapidly going down the drain.,"I started many years ago when it was ran very differently, and then it was bearable, however over the last 2 years it's been nothing but misery.

Decent job,"Wasn't really trained when I first arrived which made the job very stressful. Management kind of just threw me on the sales floor without any assistance.

This was also my first job so that played a part in the stress. ",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Customer Service ,Kansas,5/29/21,2021,5,29
"Okay place if you like working EXTRA hard without ""real"" appreciation","A typical day consists of management leaving loads of work from prior shifts, for the next shift to deal with, on top of the duties you are already responsible for. Don't expect help either, you won't get it. Team moral is looked down upon. You get wrote up for minor things, such as being exhausted or for calling out even due to medical reasons; they don't accept doctors notes as a valid form of reason. There is a decent side to walmart though. You get bonuses every 3 -4 months, and you get benefits, 401k, as well as PTO. And you also get paid a 2 dollar raise for the summer at the beach location in pier park PCB FL. Personally, the money is not worth the headache, and the stress, BUT, if you manage to befriend management, you will have a much easier time, until they get jealous of you, and betray you for being so good at your job.

"Easy Job, poor pay","Job security is great because they are always hiring.

All of the managers are very rude and they feel as though doing everything provided in their job description is an inconvenience. I have been harassed and threatened by co-workers on multiple occasions and management did nothing to provide a safe and conducive work environment. Breaks are often not given on time or at all. You have to work there over a year to accrue PAID time off but, everyone no matter how long you’ve worked there accrues PROTECTED PAID time off. Which is what can be used for doctors appointments, family emergency etc. It is easy to put in days that one might need off but it is VERY hard to get days approved.

Good benefits and pay but not worth it ,If you care about your mental health or have a family this is not the place to go if you’re OK being told you can’t go home then this is the place to work. I’ve been with the company for seven years and if I could do it over again I would they don’t care about their employees like they once did before.

Overall good experience,"I worked here for 4 years and went from 3rd Shift to 1st/2nds. Management was somewhat helpful but mostly cliquey.

Pharmacy tech unappreciated ,"This job does not appreciate its tech. Manager gossips with everyone about everyone behind their backs. Everyone talks about everyone’s personal business and they are fake to your face. The senior techs expect the new person to just figure it out without training. They do not care about families. They are not compassionate when it comes to young children being sick. If you have children I do not recommend this job. They don’t care about your family, only theirs.

Fast Paced environment,"A great foundation of culture and positivity.  As with any job however, people are what make the difference.  I came to the company from the outside world, and was relocated from across the country.  From what I learned in the DC world, Walmart Supply Chain was comprised of approximately 85% ""promote from within"".  While that provides great continuity, it also is a catalyst for inbreeding ""that's not how we do it"".  Outside Managment has essentially ZERO training, and is just thrown in the water to be berated by upper management.  While HR is planting quality seeds, the Ops sides refuses to water or feed.

Very Fast Paced!,I've worked here for almost a year. I really like how flexible they are with my school schedule. The managers are all very nice and helpful. Only downside I would say about working here is that people tend to clique up and can easily turn into a negative work environment. Also other coworkers abused the covid leave policy constantly. It made it to where we were almost always short staffed. ,4,Current Employee,Bakery/Deli Associate ,"Springfield, MO",5/28/21,2021,5,28

If you are a slacker with no skills, prepare to be promoted. If you are expecting good managers, don't even apply to this company. The younger management (good ole boys club) see women as dating opportunities instead of employees. No assessments, no mentorship, no feedback, no teamwork, and most importantly no leadership. The ""Management"" team is lazy and arrogant who hide in their offices all day and don't contribute anything until the last hour when they are freaking out.

"WalMart , do we really need to explain ? ","It's the most toxic environment you can possibly work in. Favoritism, is a daily event, let's not talk about the amount of low IQ managers. That have been miserable for 10 plus years stuck in their daily ""let's drag my you know what  around the building"" and let them beneath them solve their ever single problem.

You will get there by sucking up,"This company has no positives except they're always needing people, therefore it's easy to get hired.But you will never be management unless you suck up to the management that's already there. You have to become ""walmart material"". And that means working yourself to an early grave. It will wreck your health, destroy your marriage. The only time you'll get a healthy life/work balance is when youre an associate-because they'll cut your hours!

Don't forget you're here forever.,"The benefits:- Pays better than many smaller retailers.- Flexible scheduling for students, parents, and those seeking a second job.- Associates can change to different roles with relative ease. - Employee discount. - Relaxed dress code.- Protected PTO- stock options - benefits for full-time employeesthe problems:- Pay raises are too infrequent and too small.- Pay is not adequate for the physical and emotional demands of the job. - Scheduling can be inconsistent.- stores are held to unrealistic and sometimes nonsensical stardards that will never be achieved, but management will push this burden on to you, sometimes coming up with rules that seem to serve no purpose other than to dehumanize you or make your job more difficult.- How good or bad of a time you will depend on the competence of your supervisors. You will likely have a different boss every 3-6 months, resulting in a endless merry go round of people with their own unique kind of neurosis. If you get a good one, one of two things will happen: they will transfer or find a better job. - With only a few exceptions, you may be on your feet for seven hours or more. - more often understaffed than not- slowly crushes your spirit ",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Cumming, GA",5/26/21,2021,5,26
The Worst Company I Have Ever Worked For,"Walmart made sure that I knew they didn’t care about me or anyone else. They completely ignored my availability needs and do not schedule you appropriately. I often had less than 8 hours between shifts. Training is poor. Management has a bad attitude about helping employees.

Very hard work.  High Expectations,"For the most part you get out what you put in here.  But the newer changes to management structure are spreading people extremely thin.

Poor Management,"The work is easy to learn and not too difficult. You have to stand for long periods of time and be able do many jobs as needed. Since Walmart has team associates this means that you have be able to move from one position in the store as needed. Management of this particular store (5198) is poor. This is evident by the lack of properly scheduled shifts that leave several associates picking up the slack for understaffed shifts. Management does not take accountability for their mistakes and often times push the accountability on their associates beneath them. Don't expect to get your fifteen minute breaks or your lunch breaks on time, if you are lucky enough to even receive your breaks. ",2,Former Employee,Team Associate ,"Tifton, GA",5/26/21,2021,5,26

I then switched to  nightshift where you have to adjust to that.Always tired and sleeping alot on days off.Walmart pays well ,its a job but personally i would not do a career with them.Feeling that termination is around the corner frequently is very discouraging and the job can be a drag.Motivation goes from high to low quick.Thats just my experience but to each its own when it comes to your paying bills.",3,Former Employee,Night shift ,North Carolina,5/26/21,2021,5,26

Sucks,"I quit after working for 6 months when I didn't even have another job lined up because I hated it that much.

Not good enough to reccomend to people,"Honestly, Walmart is not the worst place to work. They allow for a lot of opportunities to live a better life. They have programs that can help you buy a car, pay for college, and even work them when you need to take a leave of absence.

One of the best jobs I had. Got paid $14 per hr for stocking. Do you know how easy stocking is? I've been doing way more than that for less pay at previous jobs! Oh and the employee discounts! Don't get me started on those! If I could sum up Walmart with  2 words it would be JOB SECURITY.

I've worked for managers that could care less about your well being and others who seem to really want you to grow with the company.  The company culture is atrocious.  I ended up leaving because it got so bad.  They are constantly pushing out long term associates that make the most money.  The will get rid of your position in a heartbeat and then force you to take a lesser paying position or you are forced into management if you qualify.

"Good work, decent pay, manageable issues ","I somewhat like it but I am a patient person most of the time. If you hate being micromanaged or left alone. You might hate it because there’s no in between. They will occasionally set time limits that are impossible to be consistent with everyday because people can get tired, lethargic or burnt out. Management doesn’t communicate at least at my location but they try their best and I’m sure they have their reasons for the delay of information. Co workers can be fun and quite delightful and it can make a day go by faster but there are moments where everyone is running around attempting to stay on track for the day which gets hard during rush hour. We were kinda pushed and told we needed to take weekend shifts which is okay but if you don’t want those shifts I’d ask about it before applying to the store . The pay is good, the work is frustrating but rewarding, management can be confusing but they’ll explain if  they have a minute.

Trash management ,There is really no formal training. You are made to do the work of 2+ people without ever hearing good job or thank you. It's always why didn't you do more?

Emotionally draining job,Job security really means I worked jobs nobody else wanted and kept showing up on time. The only reason I got the job was by passing a drug screen. We always joked about when we resign can we get our souls back from the lock box. I felt disrespected by management and micromanaged despite having a challenging disability.

Orderfilling ,"Orderfilling isn't for everyone. But if you can get the hang of it, its worth it. You can  get a bonus every payday. And 3 or 4 day work week beats a 5 or 6 work any day. Because you make just as much if not more. I get a 400 dollar bonus every payday and then get a quarterly bonus every 4 months.

Not too bad,Cashiering was one of the easiest jobs they offered. I started part time at 11.50 an hour which I thought was fair.

Greats job for students,"I had a great time and experience at Walmart. All my coworkers were friendly... I’ve even made some friends working there. But in my personal opinion, I feel as if I was underpaid. I was a cashier, but they had me pushing carts, stocking and many other things that wasn’t in the job description for what I applied for😂. Being my first job, everything was all good and I was growing accustomed to everything I was taught and learned. But overtime, dealing with the heavy workload and the lazy CSMs or Supervisors, it caused me to feel stress whenever I stepped foot in the doors for work. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great job with great people... the stress will take a toll on you.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Houston, TX",5/23/21,2021,5,23

"Constantly busy, days go fast. Promotions if you work for it",Worked here for 5.5 years and moved on for more money and better health insurance but for the most part there was a good family feel with My co workers.

Only consider this place as a last resort,"This is a company you should only consider applying for if you literally have no other options. The low barrier of entry and increased likelihood of job security are probably the two remotely positive things I can say about Walmart. On the other hand, those two positives are the result of an insanely high turnover rate caused by incompetent management and absurdly low pay for what you have to put up with (not to mention the net revenue of Walmart across the board). It doesn't matter how much you bust your butt and get praised by team leads and/or mid level management. You will likely remain stuck in the position you applied for with maybe 2% chance of actually advancing. On top of that, the upper level management have absolutely no clue how to do their job and refuse to take responsibility. It is honestly amazing how low the standards are, and then they wonder why people don't want to work for them. It doesn't help when other people ask you to do things that aren't remotely realistic when the store is understaffed and not fully equipped. The automotive department is shut down at the moment because there is maybe 1 or 2 people there at best.Unless you are absolutely desperate to get employment, and have nowhere else to go, don't bother wasting your time with Walmart. It is not worth it.",1,Current Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Scarborough, ME",5/22/21,2021,5,22

Managers need to be taught to reprimand employees with respect not in front of customers ,"There is some good, I  enjoy helping people and that makes me happy, plus we get aQuarterly bonuses !

Replacable,"Management consists if people who hide and slack off and only promote there friends. If you are a hard dedicated worker they will use you til you exhaust yourself then replace you. They constantly change work policy's so its extremely hard to get vacation times or sick leave.Morning shift has majority of the employees on day shifts who do little to no work. Night shift employees have to pick up the slack, do thier own work and still get yelled at ""for not working hard enough""Management changing work schedule without notifying you and when they want you to quit they wont give you hours or approve store transfer",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Manteca, CA",5/22/21,2021,5,22
It's not something I'd reccomend.,"- A typical work day is breaking down freight, running the stuff in your section. Cleaning as you can. That's the thing. As you can. Most days you can't get to cleaning because of the sheer amount of stuff they expect you to do.-It takes ages to actually learn how to do the job properly; the training is sub par and even if you have questions you're treated like you're a fool for asking them.-If you're not friends with any of the management it's one of those cases of brownnoser's will ascend and those that aren't well... you'll be stuck either part time or not getting the shifts you want or need.-Everyone's friendly but the cliques are probably the worst I've seen out of a job place. Unless you're the sort that everyone likes you'll end up being 'out of sorts'. Though it takes a long time to get people to talk to you and some just won't at all.-The hardest part of the job is how everyone plays the blame game and how they will always point you out if you're the new person. Often throwing you under the bus.-The most enjoyable part of this job was probably the lax rules in terms of headphone usage. Wear one not two, and you'll be fine. Take them off while out on the floor and make sure to check your volume so you can hear people just fine.-It's a rough environment to get used to and it will hurt to do so.

Not somewherr i would ever recommend working,I wasted three years of my life fighting for a job no one wants. Management doesn't care if there is an emergency. they do not take  doctors notes regarding anything. There is no time forgiveness. They blame you and not the lack of equipment or training. They hire new people instead of letting you move up.

Management doesn't help and coworkers are lazy,"I've worked at two different locations. At each location I had managers who were not helpful. They also have favorites, so many of my coworkers got away with being lazy. As someone who always goes to work and does my job, my managers usually try to get me to do most of the work instead of asking my coworkers to help me. Management is bad in general. Managers also go missing a lot, so when we need them to help us solve issues for customers they are no where to be found. Which means that customers get frustrated with us because they have to wait. I also do a lot of heavy lifting and I'm always sore and tired from work due to lifting and carrying heavy items all day.

I submitted feedback to my HR department upon leaving. I described, in great detail, a good majority of all the garbage I went through. It was swiftly swept under the rug. Nothing ever came of it.

The pay is decent and it pays the bills, but for the day in day out back breaking labor we do, it could definitely be more. The schedule they have us on is consistent, 2 to 11 everyday which is nice. Do not expect to get ANY recognition on Cap 2, zero zilch. They also expect free labor from the backroom associates by having them perform their supervisors job when they call out or go on a fake covid leave. But that is neither here nor there.

Fast-Paced and very hard hard work with high volume depending on the season but great benefits,"I just started around 3 and a half months ago . So far the work load has been extremely heavy with the peak season volume coming in and if your DC experiences a shortage of order fillers it can get hectic for those who remain . However , in contrast, the pay is good for the amount of hours ( I work overnight weekends ). So the pay bonuses are pretty decent for a 24 year old in a single home . However , understand this job work load can get heavy and physically staggering if you have never been through any strenuous activity in your life . I wouldn’t necessarily say you have to be Hercules or a Titan to survive but you will definitely benefit from being in somewhat of physical shape because that will be one less frustration you have to deal with amongst working long nights with the benefit of being able to stack properly. Other than that I think it is a good experience for people who are wanting to make decent money from the start to get established. However , I wouldn’t say being a OrderFiller for years would be smart . The wear on your body isn’t worth it . I would highly suggest looking to promote within the warehouse or get crossed trained as soon as your are eligible to . Order filling every single time you come into the warehouse WILL bore you .

It's a trap,"It's very easy to get a job at Wal-Mart. They will hire anyone who can do the simple tasks required and the pay is a little better than most entry-level hourly jobs of its kind. The problem is that once you're there, you're stuck. You are not guaranteed a fixed schedule and you will need to watch your schedule very carefully to make sure they aren't assigning you more than seven days in a row, because they will despite it being against company policy. The work/life balance is terrible; you will be too tired or have too erratic a schedule to make long-term plans. Opportunities for advancement are a joke; they have people who have been working in the same position for 5, 10, or as much as 15 years and their badges reflect it. You cannot advance unless you either have a good friend or a relative in upper management, and what they teach you in academy training is to treat workers like garbage. They also like to shift people from full-time to part-time in order to avoid paying out benefits. Do not work here unless you desperately need a job at the expense of your sanity.",1,Current Employee,Stocking Associate ,Georgia,5/21/21,2021,5,21
What I love and hate about Walmart ,"My bosses are pretty supportive of me, far more than they are required to be.All in all though, the Saginaw has been a fun place to work at, good people and some good boss outweigh the bad apples.

Find a department that suites you,Every department is going to have its own little spits and spats and not everybody works as a team player which can make things difficult and frustrating at points.

Constant threat of write ups.,"I drove a truck for this company, and was constantly under threats of being put on a step (write up) for things that weren’t occurring at our DC.

Decent job. Don't expect much. ,Expected a lot of of you but that's just par for the coarse in retail. You're not done just because your at the end of your scheduled shift. You're there until they say you're allowed to leave which might be another couple of hours. But you don't get to keep your overtime. On Fridays your told to cut all extra hours you've made. On holidays they allow you an extra 30 minutes for lunch but then you have to comeback and work the entire night for the big sale the following day. But you keep all that overtime you sacrificed family time for right? Haha no. Good for someone just getting into working world or getting thru school. I wouldn't suggest making it a career. Expect hostility from management if you disagree with any of this. ,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Corpus Christi, TX",5/21/21,2021,5,21

I think it's a stressful time for everyone right now... for the work that we do I think we should be paid a little more.

I can’t speak for all stores. ,"I worked at two different Walmart’s. My original one (a super center) I loved. I made great friends with my team and my managers. My managers were super helpful and always there when I needed them. My other store (a market) on the other hand that I transferred to, not so great. My managers were super proud of me and loved me for a week until I got what they hadn’t been doing done. Then it was downhill fast. They wanted me to do my job and more.

It all depends on who’s your manager,"It’s a good place to work, don’t get me wrong but it gets annoying with the same problems happening almost every day due to lazy managers/personel. Sometimes the way they handle the company doesn’t make things go any easier. Some days are good some days are the worst that you wanna quit right there and then there are days where you love your job. But it all comes down to how the day operations went and that ultimately comes down on the heads of who’s running the show and if they are running it not well, then we are all headless chickens running around.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"El Paso, TX",5/21/21,2021,5,21

It's exactly what you think.,"You'll be worked every day of the year, If you work overnight, you'll get only the daylight hours of Christmas off and you'll be sleeping while your family celebrates without you. The immediate management might be nice or they might be miserable people who treat you poorly, it's just a guessing game. Even if you're a supervisor, you may not have crew to get the work done--but you'll still be scolded for not finishing the work of 7 people by yourself in a night. You'll constantly be thrown under the bus, looked down upon if you work in the maintenance department, or treated as if you are substantially impaired in regards to your capability to understand basic English. They'll probably promote you if you're delusional enough to work hard--they'll work you much harder but won't pay you much more. You'll probably like your coworkers, but your friendships will be bittersweet, a constant reminder of mutually endured suffering.If you absolutely have no other option and you are desperate to get a check so you don't end up homeless, put in an application at Walmart.

Stressful and alright workplace for students and young people,"Working at walmart is alright, but there are times where the day can be stressful with working with co workers that can be rude and dont respect you at all. There can be a lot of judgementals here and there, just like everywhere else in the job market. The job is good for young people and students going to school or college, but not those who wants a career not just a paycheck to make a living. A typical day at work, is clocking in on your shift, then starting heading to your department area to start your shift, but there will be a sheet that lists employees names that are working on that day and tasks about what you will be working on. Also, there are team leads that will let you know what you will be doing, if theres no sheet. Sometimes, co workers will call off here and there which can make the day stressful and putting workers behind to catch up on stocking and helping customers. Management are so not cool when dealing with problems and employee conflicts and they can be rude and not responsive to your problem. The workplace culture at walmarts are not that great to begin with. The hardest part of the job is working by yourself or with a few co-workers, if you are short on staff. Some departments can be hard, if you are working by yourself or being a front end cashier.

I find my time is fulfilling when I’m able to help some one find what they need or understand what they need in a given situation. I learned an awful lot about individual prepaid phone companies and dry lab photo operation. I think my management team is good but they change too much which makes it difficult to work with them as many times they have different standards of operation.

Management sucks,The main thing I like about Walmart is the pay. Management has way too much favoritism and when we actually do get a good manager the company pushes them out for being human.

Relaxing job and friendly people ,"Now with all entry level jobs, you can only assume, and for good reason, that you will be working with others, and for others, that may not share the same high values and work ethics that you may share in regards to to working for any given company. This can effect your quality of living so to speak while at your job. Additionally, the consumers in your specific area will also play a huge rule in the type of environment you will be working in, as this is a retail/customer service based employment. You will deal with great customers, and you will deal with the unruly ones as well. A lot of people like to knock a company just because the people that shop there are not up to par, so to speak.

Greedy company with Lazy co-workers,"My four years at Walmart started great. Pay was better than my previous job, management was nice. It went down hill rather quickly. Management has favorites. Fellow employees would rather play around than do any actual work. I was skipped over for a management position by a person with only a year on the job and no previous retail experience, even though I had been with the company for 3 years and had 9 years retail experience.

You can't expect too much from Walmart,"Working in online grocery pickup, it was often a fast-paced environment. There's not a lot of interdepartmental contact, but within your own department it is usually a friendly environment. Coworkers were the best part of the job itself, although some of them hardly put in any work and get away with it. Most of the managers do a lot of work themselves, too, so it's nice to know that they're doing the same job as you. As with any similar job, there's always some awful customers.

Wouldn’t waste your time unless you like being walked on and being mentally drained. ,"The only good thing about Walmart is the benefits and time off that you can accumulate. The workers (most of them) are nasty, rude and don’t know what they’re doing along with the management. It’s all about favoritism and who they like the most just like any other big corporation. The pay isn’t that great and the amount of work you do for it isn’t worth it and definitely isn’t worth your mental health.

Work at Target ,"If you wanna have a job where managers will treat you with respect, than I would suggest target other than Walmart. I worked at the Walmart at 5440 and let me tell you this. The only thing that was great was the coworkers. Management thinks there the best when they probably only make $20 an hour. And the General Manager is blindness to think that he picked the right managers for his team. They switched my hours before even talking to me about it. Communication from management to associates is not even a thing. And they cut hours in the summer at least with stocking department. And you don’t even get a discount until your first 6 months. Or at least the store I worked at made us wait that long. Don’t recommend even applying to Walmart ",1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Clackamas, OR",5/19/21,2021,5,19
Everyday is a repeat of the last.,If you want a decent paying job with little to no chance of advancement Walmart is for you. If you don’t kiss up there’s no chance for advancement.

"Good pay, bad advancement.","Walmart keeps bumping up base pay at a higher rate then they give raises. A lot of areas start around 14-15$. But raises are about 2%.  Pto for new hires is a joke so don't expect much time off, especially if you're temp or part time. Advancement opportunities seem to get smaller every year and you better be managements favorite if you want to move up. Corporate seems to make major business changes on a whim so no position is safe.

Not bad first job,"Overall not a bad starting job, but you will want to leave after awhile it just gets old dealing with poor management. The management is very self centered, only care about themselves and want themselves to get all the credit. I worked my tail off the whole time and got treated like dog water. they don´t notice the hard work you put in and I feel like the company used me big time. I was L&G associate and had to work in every other area most the time for example i had to push carts, Cap2, Ogp, Cap1, Electronics, Cashier, and lots of other stuff that wasnt in my job discription. Some managers respected me and my work ethic and gave me credit for my work but overall more then half of them just used me. On top of that the most managers there would just make me feel like outright swas, talk to me like I have no clue what im doing or don´t fully explain what they need done and then get mad when I ask questions. Lastly I mostly enjoyed the job because some customers felt me and treated me with respect. I also enjoyed that every day for the most part was diffrent, meet new people, learn new things. Other than poor management i would recomend this job pay is really good for a first job and its easy money.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Muscatine, IA",5/19/21,2021,5,19

It's just a job to pay the bills,"WalMart was an okay place to work at. They're semi flexible with scheduling, but you are expected to be available at all times. So if you have children, it can be very difficult to work around their school schedule. The work is nothing special, nothing too hard. It's a chill environment until your manager shows up. Managers tend to take out their stress on you. They don't really listen to what you have to say, which they should because you're the one on the floor who knows what sells and what doesn't. What needs to be prioritized and what doesn't. But managers won't consider anything you have to say. ",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Lubbock, TX",5/19/21,2021,5,19

Firstly, management is very disconnected from their employees. They will increase work quotas without explanation or improvement and will sit down (something lowly associates can’t do).

It's Walmart,"The work is grueling, the customers are rude, we're wildly understaffed from the pandemic and all of my coworkers keep getting sick. No one wants to work for so little pay anymore, especially not 9-hour overnight shifts. Does that mean we get a more relaxed attitude towards the sheer volume of work being presented to us? No. Just because it's a three-person job and there's only one of you doesn't mean it shouldn't be getting done!So basically it's exactly what you expect working at Walmart.",2,Former Employee,Stocker ,Iowa,5/18/21,2021,5,18

"Once you get used to the demanding job, it is not too bad of a place to work.","I worked in Cap I Production, so the work entailed daily, constantly being on your feet, lifting, and quickly meet deadlines. Stressful department. Some of the areas in this department required more than one person to man the area effectively. Often-times I was the only one there (being newly trained). My training was quick and not thorough. I had to keep asking questions and for help, but I finally caught on. If you're fortunate, you will get someone who truly knows how to properly operate all the equipment ….. instead of you having to figure out the correct way. It pays to read well and read everything you come in contact with. As long as you do your job though and just follow the instructions, there will be no problems. Also, sometimes the changes in procedures that came down didn't make good practical sense and ended up being too time consuming especially when you have to meet those deadlines; So it was very frustrating, at times.

Wasn't sure what I was expecting but it wasn't this.,"I came into working as an OGP thinking I had accomplished getting a dream job for my very first one. The paradise of it all runs out quicker than you can blink - team leads either slow your progress down, or get at you for not speeding up enough. It's very difficult to get orders done for customers when you're understaffed enough, and then suddenly someone asks you to do product returns which can literally be done at any other time of the day, and causes the other workers to be left behind with the mess that is the backroom, and parking lot.No one answers the phone nor trains their employees to do so. Managers are so hard to find throughout the day, I spent nearly three trying to find someone to ask about availability changes, and got lucky when I saw them walking to the restroom. It was such a hassle to even get their EMAIL.Overall, if you're truly desperate for the earnings and don't mind feeling thrown around, go for it, but if you need to care for your physical/mental health, as well as your free time, it's like a jailcell.",2,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Port Richey, FL",5/18/21,2021,5,18

Bad company,"They can’t keep employees because they constantly “head hunt” look to fire people for no reason. Management will throw you under the bus any chance they get. Most people in management sucked up to get there, they didn’t earn it. Management doesn’t treat employees like people. You are nothing more than a number to them. Management does discriminate if you are not a “favorite”. Most people that work at Walmart are “two faced” and will metaphorically stab you in the back and walk over top of you to advance themselves. If you anger them by out smarting them they will hunt you like a hawk and find a reason to make your life hellish and punish you. Walmart hates smart workers that are not “sheep”.  And watch what you say, they will fire you for saying a joke. They are mainly a liberal company and don’t like people that disagree with their ideals.

Grind Yourself Away,"The DC has set shifts, so unless you have very special circumstances it's take it or leave it. They have a nice long on-boarding and training period that you get paid your full rate for. After that it's all down hill. They never leave rate/production/quota alone and always end up raising it. On top of that you'll find that they get increasingly strict in the procedures and policies while simultaneously giving you more responsibilities without giving you more time. The money is good compared to most places around but the DC overall is really unforgiving and doesn't give nearly enough PTO for a job with a very strict and narrow clock in window. The PTO that you do get, which is after you've been there for months, has to be used if you're late or absent no matter the reason (unless you're on LOA). The company puts up a big show about safety and doing a bunch of little things but refuses to acknowledge that it's their crazy production numbers that are making people hurts themselves. There's plenty of people in warehouse that are the main provider for their family and it's either develop injuries from the repetitive and fast pace production or let their family starve.",2,Former Employee,FID Processor ,"Ottawa, KS",5/17/21,2021,5,17

WalMart doesn't care about their employees,I would never work for WalMart.. u don't get moved up in less ur in they're little click.. if u have experience in a certain area .. they only use when needed.. if a position opens in that area and they like someone more then u .. then WalMart tells u ur not qualified enough .. after having 4 years experience.. and used in that position majority of the time .. they will over look u.. very in unconsiderate.. doesn't make u feel like ur a team member.. just a body .. just a person running the cash register.. never awarded for good deeds making customer cared about,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Henderson, KY",5/16/21,2021,5,16
absolute terrible management. ,"Walmart doesn’t care about you, you’re very much replaceable. Management never helps with your needs, and never gets anything done. You can’t complain about anything because they simply don’t do anything about it. If you’re not full time you’re barely even scheduled. I suggest you don’t work upfront it’s the most boring-est job there. They are very unprofessional about everything.

"Job isn't bad, but customers can be the worst part of the day",The pay is above average for the work you do there. The only thing that'll make you quit is the customers.

A decent job for dependable people who care,"Some stores are great, some are in need of a lot of help. (to be fair, since the pandemic, stores are short-handed - for whatever reason, they can't get people hired or they can't get people to stay) The benefits are pretty good, decent hours which you have some flexibility in choosing. The pay for some positions could be better. You know what's expected of you and if you come to work and do your job, it's a pretty easy place to work. It can be loud sometimes when it's busy and if you're not a people person or customer service oriented, don't apply. You're surrounded by people all day and yes, they need help.

It can range from 11-17 starting off, depending on what department you're working in. Other than that, you don't get the best raises.

This job killed my health. Honesty and integrity are very lacking.,Constant changes with the company put the normal employees at more risk. Safety and regulations are often ignored making jobs for other departments more difficult and some times impossible. Replacements for broken equipment are often needed and ignored when requested even if it is a safety or security risk. It comes off as management could care less. I never want to go back to retail after working in this horrible place and will forever fear large groups due to past events (Black Friday).Trying to transfer to another area in the store due to complications in another area is also nearly impossible as management will tell you one thing and do another. Management does not care about the needs or wants of the employee and only seem to do things for employees that are favored.,1,Former Employee,Walmart Electronics Associate ,"Spanaway, WA",5/15/21,2021,5,15

Tell you move faster, they expect you move fast. Even if they ask you to stay longer, with some managers its more in a passive aggressive kinda way. I did make friends there. They don't offer overtime, more than likely they will give part time some weeks you gotta 40 hours and still considered part time, that's how they do away with benefits! Everyones different I personally wouldn't recommend it.",1,Former Employee,stocker/frieght ,"Vestal, NY",5/15/21,2021,5,15
Terribly understaffed,"They often expect you to run a department alone, which involves stocking shelves, answering customer questions, checking out customers and putting returns back where they go. They fully staff the slower hours and leave the afternoon/night shift screwed. They expect you to work in multiple departments despite only being trained to work in one. They offer a 15 minute break every 2 hours however you can never find someone to cover your department so you’ll never get that break. Benefits are okay, but that’s really the only positive. Management does absolutely nothing and people in your department do nothing as well, assuming they don’t go off into other departments. ",2,Current Employee,Entertainment Team Member ,"Lebanon, OH",5/15/21,2021,5,15
Fun for the people you meet. ,"Working here is a hit or miss opportunity. I personally worked at the southside Walmart in Pueblo, and if you just take in regard the other associates it’s not terrible. Though, moving up is a pain. Even knowing how to do everything in the front end, they’ll select people who has to learn how to do it instead. Even if you get selected to do something “more” they’ll let you learn it and do it, but at times give you excuses as to why they can’t pay you more to do the job. So you’ll essentially be doing Team Lead pay grade things with whatever you’re getting paid. You’ll pretty much be a overvalued associate. A lot of favoritism and boot licking goes around and has shown that with enough sucking up to management, you can do and be whatever you want. Though if it’s a temporary solution of employment options, it’ll work. Personally in my opinion, at least for this store, I wouldn’t see it for any type of longevity period.",2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Pueblo, CO",5/15/21,2021,5,15

Good co-workers management is chaos ,"The co-workes are generally good people and mostly helpful in sharing work information so you can get your job done.  I found them to be the most helpful and the reason to look forward to going to work.Management is chaos.  I knew 4 store managers, one was on point ( helpful, curious and generally cared about the store operation ) the others were absent and dismissive to down right uncaring and treated the employees and customers disrespectfully.  The Ast Managers ( now coaches ) are rarely on the same page and generally dismissive to the workers unless you cater to them and even then equal treatment questionable.  This is what makes the work miserable, yes it is always rushed but that is retail work, but you should not come to work feeling lost and constantally under undue stress because management is disconnected and generally have no day to day plan. So in conclusion, love and miss many people there but management made work miserable, but for one exception. ",2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"West Brownsville, PA",5/15/21,2021,5,15
The worst work experience ever,"The management at Walmart are complete jokes. Good luck trying to get a day off because your request can sit there for months just for them to deny it. Also they overwork worked me to the point where they informed me i was being switched to fulltime because i kept hitting fulltime hours from being called in so much. Not to mention they never do what they say they'll do. And honestly the way they did the raises is really unfair, you'd think they would give the front end associates a raise when they deal with customers and the stupidity from management THE MOST. Also if Walmart wants to have ""rules"" they need to make sure they apply them to EVERY associate. Also i've worked for two different walmarts and i can say that at each store they treat the people who are good at their jobs like garbage.

You're pretty much guaranteed to never move up here, all the management is either blatantly rude or is just so obviously non-caring about whatever requests/questions. They will constantly dog you and say that you should be going faster, and have no problem giving you rude remarks as they walk away before you have a chance to respond.

Many employees quit the same week they were hired due to treatment from higher members of management. The team I worked with was very close knit and we got along very well. If not for them I likely would not have stayed working with this location for very long. Consistent hours and days off were nice and after a year there was a raise.",2,Former Employee,Mod Team Associate ,"Glendale, AZ",5/14/21,2021,5,14

"Great Benifits , ALOT of Drama and poor ethical Communication with Managers. ","I was a fresh team lead at Walmart. Specific the bakery and deli. My store was quite a mess but others stores suffered as well. Management could be very unprofessional. Like all companies, they have great managers and not-so-well ones also. Every store is different, especially if you are in a different district or have different market managers. My manager was very laid back, not as much interaction, and avoided conflict, which caused bigger issues. Open door policy really doesn't do anything. Managers just stay away from you. Benefits are a plus, along with overtime and PPTO. Extremely dangerous to work at with the COVID going on. Not as clean as we need to be, and NOT as STAFFED as Walmarts should be also.

Awful place to work.,Management was inept. Was never properly staffed and there was no hope of ever getting enough help.

Favoritism and Bad Management ,"The main problem is management. The store manager picks favorites and hardly talks to anyone else, plus they always blame issues in the store on the wrong department. The store itself can’t keep up with a simple change in store system due to how mismanaged it is. If a manager doesn’t like you then they’ll just transfer you out of your department. Other departments lose employees so quickly that the store as a whole can’t keep up. It’s an insanely stressful environment.

it did not care about its employees,Walmart did not care about me as an employee when I worked there. Anyone that did not work with us would place unreasonable demands. For example working 100 days of over 100 degree farenhite would have to work both sides of the lot pulling carts by self. When unloading 3 trucks and we had compliants from management on moving too slow by getting it done in 4 hours without a break. The direct people you work with will care and do their best.

"Too much work, not enough time","Worked ON and we always had to clean up from the previous crew. Management likes to throw you into departments you never worked and expect you to kill 5+  pallets of freight and then are disappointed when you can't get it done.Their idea is you need to magically make the freight disappear but if the shelf and bins are full and they don't want pallets in the back room well, it's impossible.They expect you even if disabled to work like a healthy 18 year old.When glitches in the system came up management was slow to or did not want to correct it.My hours and days were set at 40 so that was good, to have a set day off.Need to mention since they are so tight we never had a TC70 to check out to do our jobs correctly, we had to wait until the previous shift hopefully turned theirs in. This made our jobs more difficultA recent change in zoning with night crew zoning from 6-7am, so after throwing freight all night they expect you to be full of energy to zone two isles in 92 or 95 in 50 minutes and make it look perfect.Want an easy job, door greeters who just stand there and hand a cart off to customers and spend more of their time talking",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Clarkston, WA",5/13/21,2021,5,13

Awful,"I could go on for hours about why I hate working at Walmart. Without going into too much detail to keep the anonymity; they blatantly ignored disabilities, are way understaffed, are way underfunded, and over work their employees to exhaustion. Every day corporate pushed our numbers higher and higher without the necessary people, equipment, or space. Our team leads would push us to the limit, cutting corners to meet the expectations put on them. When they would ask for more equipment they would be told no time and time again. The few people they managed to hire never lasted long because of the treatment. The team leads would show up late, hours late. I once had a day where there was no member of our department managers for 7 hours straight. Leaving those of us who actually cared about our jobs to become the managers, without the pay or authority. Other managers would be sent over to help but they all hated us and bossed us around without knowing what goes on in our department. Nobody was correctly trained, neither of the team leads have gone through the necessary training, the pickers don't know what their doing, and the dispensers slack off leaving the back room completely screwed over. The only employee to pick up all the extra work in the back was left alone constantly. Management disregarding their disability and constant pleas for another assistant to help.

Management is poor, there is literally managers that don’t do anything, and will ask you one question when they see you Example (What commodity is next) and sit on their phones and get paid for it. On top of this management is disorganized and fundamentally flawed due to favoritism as presented above. You have managers that are incompetent and not qualified to do their jobs, some don’t even have the training done at the academy that goes along with the job. The only good thing about this job if you can deal with management and rude customers is the pay, and benefits (If you ever manage to get them). To receive benefits you have to work 40hrs a week and for three months straight. What will management do, give you a 38hr work week the last week of your three months to reset the timer.

WalMart does not care about their employees,"*I worked in the online grocery department*Management constantly demands more from employees, while giving nothing in return. I worked in the department for multiple years, and over that period of time, our expected workload easily doubled or tripled, and we received no raise in pay or benefits (aside from the company wide raise, which hardly counts and still does not bring us to the pay levels of the competition in the area) We have major system issues nearly every week, bugs and glitches in our software that aren't fixed for months on end, and half of our equipment is broken or just missing. Upper management sets entirely unrealistic expectations and pushes the whole department to the breaking point, and reevaluating those expectations is treated as an absolute last resort. If you value your sanity I cannot recommend working in this department.

Busy work day,You will always have something to do. You do get a hour lunch break and two additional 15 min breaks so it’s not that bad.

Labor Trap,"Most supervisors treat you like you're an annoyance if you have to ask for clarification on things that you were never taught or not clearly instructed on, you are never consulted if you need any assistance with something and when they send someone from somewhere else in the store to 'help' when there was never a need for help in the first place they hold it against you for ""always needing help"" and ""not being able to do your job"". If you are overloaded with work and are forced to take your lunch before you hit the 6 hour mark, they hold the unfinished work and any additional work that built up against you even though you absolutely literally couldn't take care of it with the limited assistance you had when you did need it. If one member of your area gets in trouble, your whole area gets in trouble because ""you're supposed to be working as a team"" but if you try to work as a team to get jobs done you get lectured for ""not splitting the work evenly"". If you dare to have the audacity to leave your perfectly completed work area to do something like get a drink, ask another associate about work stuff, or even just use the restroom really quickly, people will hunt you down and hound you about it. The benefits are good, the PTO system is fair if you've worked there for a while and the stock options are handy, but it's not enough really. One day they'll be telling you that they love how much dedication and work you put into your job and how above and beyond you always go and then the next day they are lecturing you about how you're ""not productive enough"".

"Good pay,Bad management ","They paychecks at Walmart are pretty good. Especially for teenagers. My first few checks were around $700. The management can be pretty trashy at times. They didn’t ask me and many other minors for our working papers or said that they don’t need them. They claim a flexible schedule but don’t change your schedule when needed. They may give minors too many hours. This is a good first job,unless you care about how good the management is.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"North Brunswick, NJ",5/12/21,2021,5,12
"As a salaried manager, DO NOT DO IT! ","The management is horrific! I’ve never seen anything like it.  I’ve never heard more in my life, “you’re just an associate number” and “it’s not personal, it’s business”. They use Intimidation, they are threatening, negativity is severe, no job security, tons of favoritism, no equipment to do the job, constantly changing direction with no notice, work 70 hours a week during holidays and busy times with no additional pay, bonus structure is tighter every year to keep from giving them.  Surpassing goals is not recognized, rather, anything they can find to pick on instead is then made into a huge issue to avoid positive recognition.  I was there for several years, and as Walmart has changed, it has gone from a great place to work to one I’m embarrassed to work at. As an associate, it’s a mixed pool as to whether it’s unbearable or not, depending on who are the “favorites”, and it’s not who has the best customer service skills or works the hardest. It’s who flatters the store manager and the market manager the best. It’s sad how big business can behave this way. ",2,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Scottsbluff, NE",5/12/21,2021,5,12

A lot of verbal abuse,"A typical day involved being by yourself covering 3-4 departments and nobody coming when you call for help. Constantly ignored. Then, you are yelled at for not getting everything done. Members of management rarely communicate with each other. Nobody puts any effort into learning about you as an individual. If you have disabilities, you are actively sought out/targeted and compared to other associates that are much stronger than you or have different abilities than you do. The hardest part of the job was not, in fact, dealing with customers - it was dealing with management making me feel like I was never good enough. If you're the type that puts everything into your job, avoid Walmart. You will never be appreciated, valued, or recognized for anything that you do. It's a waste of energy. They're all leeches. The benefits are a waste of money, time, and effort. It's hard to understand. You never get your insurance cards. If you must go on medical leave, you must deal with a third-party company called ""Sedgwick""; they are difficult and aggravating to work with. If you must call out sick from work, they do not accept doctors' notes. If you have a heart attack, you're fired. You get in trouble for being sick and are made to work when sick. During the pandemic, you must work, even if you are diagnosed with the virus. They do not care about your safety - they care about the money in their pocket. In conclusion, Walmart is constantly cycling through associates and management. You're a number to them, not a person. Your personal abilities do not matter to them.

"Unproductive, chaotic workplace","Everyday we are accosted by a slurry of at least 3 different managers/supervisors, 1 of which belongs to my department the rest just float through. They come through complaining about various customers and/or various departments. Often each assigning us multiple tasks despite being told what other managers/supervisors have instructed us to do, usually instructing us to complete what we are doing in the moment and then move on to what they want disregarding the previous managers/supervisors instructions. Poor management along with a generally high turn-over rate, constant shuffling of long term employees and work schedules make working here a nightmare. I cant count the number of times I've seen peers breakdown, quit, or become hostile because of the stress this environment causes. Yet nothing changes. I quit.",1,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Auburn, NY",5/11/21,2021,5,11
Managers are a joke. It’s a very toxic environment ,I wouldn’t recommend working for Walmart. The managers & team leaders are always talking negative about employees to each other and other employees. They say you’ll have the chance to advance in another area but that is false. If they don’t want you to move to another department you won’t. People get written up for nothing at all. Some managers are bullies. There is no TRAINING on the job for the specific things you do.

The co-workers are usually fine but the management is terrible and unorganized. Manages are rude and don’t know what their doing as usual. A lot of the problems with Walmart are self inflicted problems from the managers. But it’s chill for anyone in high school or not doing anything. Oh and no drug test to start if you know what I mean.

The Academy gets you excited and the reality is brutal,"When you go to the Walmart Academy you are really excited for a chance to work at a company that values goodness, kindness and honesty. The largest retailer in the world. After working in retail management for 18 years prior to being contacted by a Walmart recruiter I was super excited to be chosen for an opportunity to become an ASM.  The Academy was awesome. The culture they taught was just what I was looking for and wanted to go all the way in career growth. Unfortunately the reality of the stores are favoritism of the Manager and who joins them on their store specific agenda. Gossip, backstabbing, constant chaos and I worked in 3 stores. I have never experienced such childish behaviors among professional adults. It’s truly sad because Walmart could be such a great company to work for.

Just alright for starting out,"I worked Oct. 2019 - May 2020 as a cashier. My co-workers were a cool diverse group of people, with a rotation of individuals. The work itself wasn't really difficult, but the customers were the worst part of working there. The managers were pretty good, and willing to work with my schedule. there weren't enough CSMs (basically assistant managers) working the front, so when we needed assistance they were busy somewhere else due to understaffing and a great amount of tasks given to them (not their fault). Sometimes upper management was often nowhere to be found, and sometimes they seemed underqualified. There were nice customers often in my lines, but most were entitled and a good few were nightmares to deal with. I enjoyed making friends with other co-workers and learning about their lives, everyone seemed to sympathize with each other due to the understanding of how horrible customers can be. Pay is alright for starting out, but as time went on I began to see that it wasn't enough for what you can possibly go through in a day/week/month.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Victorville, CA",5/11/21,2021,5,11

Management only cared about making themselves and the store look good, they did not care about the employees. Some of them could be downright rude and condescending. They also expected you to be able to be in 2 places at once and do the work of 2 or more people. We could be super busy with customers at the registers and they would get mad at us for not getting all the candy put away. They were also really bad with scheduling, we would have too many cashiers on slow days, and not nearly enough on busy days. Hours were pretty flexible, but not consistent at all. It was pretty typical to work until 11 at night and turn around and come back at 7 the next morning.

Easy work most days,"The job itself is easy but they like to make it more difficult and what you're required to do seems to change based on the mood of the people above you.They've had issues with bad management for awhile.

Some associates can do nothing all shift and they won't think anything of it, others if they slow down even slightly or have an off day they'll get pulled into meetings about not doing enough even if they're otherwise a good worker. If you need a paycheck and can tolerate terrible management for a bit then it's an okay job but I wouldn't recommend staying a long time.

laid back and work isn't too difficult ,If they figure out you are a hard worker at Walmart then they will continuously work you harder and harder making you pick up the slack of other departments. The other departments are people that have worked there for 10+ years and have no motivation to get anything done and would rather stretch any small task to the end of the day.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Wichita, KS",5/11/21,2021,5,11
Pretty fun,I’m a cashier at Walmart and to be honest it’s pretty chill. Although you do deal with mean customers sometimes and really big lines too. I’d say the pay is pretty decent too!,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Johnston, IA",5/11/21,2021,5,11
It’s a job,"Just like any job, you make the most of the opportunities that you get. One does not have to stay a cashiers for years. I have been all over Walmart and it has afforded me to pay my bills and to be a leader. Opportunities are endless if you have goals and you set you mind to it. Yes managers come and go, yes people walk out, yes there are a lot of disgruntled old associates but you have to keep all that out of your mind to get where you want to go. That’s in life general ",4,Current Employee,Assistant Manager/ realty execution  ,"DFW, TX",5/11/21,2021,5,11
The environment was pretty relaxed and steady ,"Fast paced at times, training was pretty easy. They didn’t Let you do work on your own unless you were fully trained. A lot of managers were able to work around your schedule.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Huntersville, NC",5/11/21,2021,5,11

Unappreciative & overworked ,"Back when I started working in garden center was awesome everyone was trustworthy and everyone was a member of a team , but later things started changing more unnecessary rules, management started to careless of employees and their opportunities to get promoted moving forward . Management (dep. Managers) don’t get pay enough for all the tasks they’re expected to do . And associate wise ,no comment .",1,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate/Second Assistant Front End Manager ,"El Paso, TX",5/11/21,2021,5,11
Mediocre ,"Very stressful environment, it wasn’t bad all the time but I really did feel unappreciated by upper management my entire time working there. I worked 2 different stores and it wasn’t worth the money or the stress. ",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Springfield, MO",5/11/21,2021,5,11
Unrealistic ethics,Nothing at all is good about working here as an over night stock associate the management have unrealistic expectations of how fast a pallet should be done...let them tell even if this pallet is stacked high and packed with small stuff they tell you it should take 45 minutes to an hr the lies they tell..oh and beware they may schedule u without u knowing that's how I left because of their mistake.,2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,1409 houston tx,5/11/21,2021,5,11

Management can make or break you,"As the title says, management plays a huge role in how a job at Walmart feels.

Good cookie cutter company with no room for promotion.,Wal-Mart is a good company that ain't going nowhere.  I felt that it was a big cookie cutter company.  Everyone got the same raises and bonuses.  If you are an individual like myself who wants to excel and get promoted it's probably not going to happen.,4,Former Employee,Area Manager ,"Grove City, OH",5/10/21,2021,5,10
"Overworked, under staffed","As the cap 2 supervisor I would plan the day out, which included unloading GM and Grocery truck. I was over between 15-25 associates per day, planning which aisle/area of the store they would be stocking. I was also in control of inventory.

Good ,I liked working  there for the 8.yrs from the day  I start to when I left everything  was great etc. Etc etc etc etc etc   bosses were very nice work ,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"North Tonawanda, NY",5/10/21,2021,5,10
It’s okay ,Not bad but if you want to make a decent living and career you won’t have much of a home life. You’ll have to go management (salaries) and you’ll work odd shifts. Upper echelon of management will say you get days off but yo salary so you’ll get called in on your days off even if you put PTO in. I saw more people stressed and working there that hated it but were to far into it to leave. I did AP for 5 years and talked with my managers often about the struggles. As an AP you’re in the highest pay but it’s still hardly enough to be able to save. ,3,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,Louisiana,5/10/21,2021,5,10

Pretty much every man for themselves.,Managers try and get the most money out of you while paying you less. They also sell you out to upper management for a dime.

Soul sucking even for retail,If it's not the customers it's the managers. They want you to do the work of 10 people with one person and will yell at you if you fail to do it. They do not care a single bit. ,1,Current Employee,Stock Associate ,Texas,5/10/21,2021,5,10
Bad,Bad place to work. People there were rude. Management is useless. Coworkers get paid more to do the same work. No room to grow. No way to use my actual skills.,1,Former Employee,OGP Associate ,"Franklin, IN",5/10/21,2021,5,10

No schedule flexibility,"If you are a student, a college student in particular, I really wouldn't recommend working at Walmart. They do expect you to work weekends and holidays, and they don't respect the fact that you are part-time. There have been several times where they have given me more hours than I had asked for. When I did ask for a schedule change it was the hardest thing ever to get a hold of somebody who would actually help me. Each time I asked somebody for help they would just direct me to a different person.",3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Ocala, FL",5/10/21,2021,5,10
Benefits ,I love working there but I don’t get it it’s the 2nd this has happens I’m not on the schedule for a week because my manager decides to go on vacation and not right the schedule I have bills to pay might have to look for new job I’m sick of it really second time it has happened ,2,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,Arizona,5/10/21,2021,5,10

"Great people, but avoid Apparel if you don't like answering the phones","Most coworkers were awesome and a great perk of working there. Pay is better than average. Zoning ( aka. folding and organizing) was my favorite part of the job. However, if you work in Apparel, be prepared to answer the phone. They hide this from you, it's not in your training or your job description. Dealt with lots of entitled customers and it made it very challenging to continue to work there. Be prepared to walk A LOT to look for any item all over the store. Managers will also hate answering their calls and don't really support the people working in Apparel.",3,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Milford, OH",5/10/21,2021,5,10
Bad environment ,"Walmart will work you to death. The pay is decent. The management does not support the staff in anyway. They do not provide an atmosphere or the tools to get a job done, but still expect it to be done. ",1,Former Employee,Front End Team Lead ,"Russellville, AR",5/10/21,2021,5,10

"It’s a job, but go elsewhere if you have options","The maintenance job is mostly cleaning the bathrooms, keeping the floors clean, and taking out trash. You have to have a lot of flexibility on what you’re willing to do because you’ll be asked to do just about everything besides cashiering. Rarely had to stock, but very often had to help push carts in the lot.I was able to find a routine that allowed me to get all of the most important things done in a timely manner. Management changed, and suddenly I was being pulled in a million different directions.I received a lot of comments like, “why are you doing that instead of this”. I received a lot of criticism and not very much encouragement, and was made to feel bad a lot of the time.I was quite anxious and paranoid because of the workplace culture. I always felt like I was being watched and that I never had approval from management.The people in my department were really nice and helpful. Communication and cooperation helped the day go by smoothly.Overall, a lot of physical work. I felt very tired after my shifts. We did get two paid 15 minute breaks and an unpaid hour long lunch break.The worst part of the job is management hounding you and harassing you.",2,Former Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Columbia, MO",5/10/21,2021,5,10
Can be hard at times but also fun,Management has no communication so you may be doing 3 jobs but paid for one. You will do all the work and if you need help dont expect to find your manager anywhere around.,4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Hohenwald, TN",5/10/21,2021,5,10

Walmart Sucks,"Walmart is one of those places that just sucks the soul out of you to work for. You're always understaffed as management yells at you from the office, they have sheets that tell them the amount of man hours per truck and job, yet act mystified that half the amount of people can't do it in the same time. All the while whenever you bring up a problem, you're just always met with the same ""Just make it work"" response. They also have been steadily taking away your bonuses and reducing overall PTO, god forbid you're part-time, then you wont accrue PPTO (read sick days) until you've been there for a couple years. Good luck trying to use the small amount of PTO as well, 85% of the time it will be rejected.Work here long enough to find another job.",2,Former Employee,Electronics Department Manager ,"Morgantown, WV",5/10/21,2021,5,10

The downside is the Spark App that drivers use to get deliveries.its an absolute nightmare, never works properly. Some days you can get jobs easily, other days it's impossible. They add to many drivers, most don't speak English. And they are rude. Most deliveries pay well and most customers tip decent.But when you climb three flights of stairs and get no tip.you start to hate people. But you do get a tip 95,% if the time.

Pays better than most retail jobs BUT unrealistic production expectations,"Walmart pays better than many other retailers (example: an associate at Dollar General can expect to make $8/hr where the same job at Walmart will pay $11). However, Walmart has unrealistic expectations for production. (Example: a stocker is expected to throw a minimum of 50 cases/cartons of stock per hour regardless of weight. So, they expect a 120 case pallet to be moved from the storage room to the floor, broken down to stock carts, and fully stocked within 2 hours 10 minutes. Paid breaks are counted in this time, so you actually have 1 hour 55 minutes). If you are shorter and have to use the ladders to reach shelves, you have to move faster to keep up with production times. Every stocker is expected to work a minimum of 3 pallets (but they push you to do 4) and fully zone those aisles and other areas of the store in an 8 hour shift. Cashiers are expected to scan a minimum of 30 items per minute (this includes time for the customer to complete the transaction, so you have to actually scan closer to 50 items per minute in order to allow time for the payment portion of each sale). Failure to meet production standards will result in disciplinary actions.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Mod Team ,"Skyland Blvd, Tuacaloosa, AL",5/9/21,2021,5,9

Store Management,Must be money driven!! Work and life balance almost non- existent. Conference calls and follow on most company scheduled off days. A huge disconnect from home office and reality.

Amazing coworkers and awesome opportunities for permanent employees,"I wasn't a permanent employe. Only temp, and I came in towards the start of the pandemic. I worked 1 day with the mask and ended up passing out from the mask triggering my asthma. They were really understanding and even helped me with the process of going onto leave of absence until I could figure put what to do about the mask. At that time, they also helped me start the process of getting a face shield, which was denied, yet, no one at my store could figure out why. At which point, my managers started helping me design and make my own mask that I could work with, without passing out from not getting enough air. I also have a few.... set backs, as far as health is concerned, but even so, the people I worked with in OGP were very supportive and helpful when needed. I would definitely recommend going to this company if you're looking for a good job with good people.

Job security and the benefits Wal-Mart offers their employees ,E-commerce is a good dept to be in. It is however very fast paced.

Management at all levels take this very seriously.  The ability to be a team player is a must to survive.

Don’t work there ,It is a terrible place to work at. This company does not give their associates any flexibility for work. I was given a position as a personal shopper and given a schedule that did not work with my College schedule. I was told that if I had an issue with this they can simply take away my hours. The management is constantly abusing their power. Two managers even broke a sink while spending time in the restroom together and nobody was fired.,1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Killeen, TX",5/9/21,2021,5,9
I would not recommend anyone to work at Walmart,"There is lack of communication between management and associates, the store I work at lacks work flow organization, Management shows no appreciation for work associates do on a daily basis,  Associates are pushed to complete tasks beyond their capability with respect to scheduled work day hours,  Management rarely is felixable when associates request personal time off.",2,Current Employee,Apparel Team Associate/Store Operator/Fitting Room Associate ,"El Paso, TX",5/9/21,2021,5,9

I’ve met my manager maybe six times face to face and I’ve been working there for over a year. Mostly deal with Team Leads. Promises are never kept. Bright side is you’ll probably find some great friends in coworkers. I met some of the most amazing people while working there but that’s about it. Front end gets overlooked and never gets raises.

Management seems confused. ,The corporate restructuring has eliminated jobs and added more responsibility to the team leaders which they are neither trained or naturally capable of handling.

I'm pretty sure if they weren't I'd be miserable. The customers are rude, the work is drab, and management was constantly jumping down your throat.

Each workday you'd meet up with your manager and team leads for a meeting, get told that you'd either stock, work top stock, bin, unload truck, or some sort of errand work like pushing carts.

The amount of times my job description has expanded because someone else quit is ridiculous and I’m tired of it. I was fine with overworking. I’m nowhere near scared of hard work.

could be so much better if they listened to employees,Management does not care about their employee or customers as much as they should/could. The bottom line seems to be money not customer satisfaction and certainly not employee satisfaction. They tell you one thing during training then it's different when you actually start working. They expect 1 person to take care of 13 self-check registers when training says there will be 1 for every 4. Often they will give you your break 30 minutes early or 30 minutes late. Some days you can't leave on time because you have to wait for someone to show up to take over for you. They rarely schedule enough cashiers - dont allow for inevitable call ins making for angry customers. CSMs have to much to do and cant always help you when you need it so customers have to wait sometimes 10-15 minutes for problem resolution.,3,Current Employee,Self Checkout Host/Cashier ,"Lexington, KY",5/7/21,2021,5,7

If you do not reach your production you are given occurences, even though your job is dependent on others.

"Good benefits and job security, overworked and underappreciated","You get your benefits and a 10% discount card (only works on certain items) after 90 days with the company. Walmart also has a deal with Guild Education for you to get a degree for a dollar a day. It is nice if you can afford to not be full time, but I personally felt it was challenging to work full time and have 15+ hours per week to dedicate to online classes. Great job security if you show up and do your job. It feels like there are never enough associates no matter what part of the store you are in. Personal shopping is a fairly easy job, though most days were basically the same. I learned about new products or items I didn't know existed while fufilling customer orders. You don't have to worry about getting your steps in because other than lunch and/or breaks, you're on your feet all day. Management can be hit or miss. It doesn't feel like they are trained to be leaders, so some managers are naturally good leaders and others aren't. The hardest part of the job was feeling overworked and under appreciated. Sometimes customers will be rude for really no reason, but most customer interactions were pleasant.

Always evolving for efficiency ,Walmart is constantly trying to improve efficiency. There’s a new mgmt structure every two years and new scheduling policies. It’s 50/50 if it’s going to actually work though. Mngr positions have a lot of stress so I prefer sales associate positions. It’s not a bad job if you like customer service and a fast paced environment. The medical insurance is not great. They do offer quarterly bonuses if the store maher its sales goals.

Working as a dairy associate was ~chill~,"I had amazing supervisors who gave me realistic and reachable goals to attain for my workday.

Most freight would come in around mid-day and by that point, most of the milk and picks would be done so id work freight until the last hour of the night which was dedicated to cleaning (just sweeping and mopping.) The only hard part about this job is freezing inside the dairy cooler and the occasional stress of trying to help each customer that's requesting help. I also found it hard to work with pulling in freight from the truck inside the cooler. I lost about 23lbs in my 5/6 months working at Walmart. So you really do get paid to work out.

Walmart is a great place to start!,"Walmart is a good place to work. There are many positions to choose from. I wish I would have started there straight out of high school because they have a education program that covers all tuition and fees. I have to pay 1 dollars a day, which is nothing compared to the student loan debt I have acquired before starting at Walmart. They offer great benefits overall. The managers can be challenging at times ,but I've worked at 3 different stores because my spouse is in military, all managers are not the same. Some are amazing team players who actually care about there associates. There is a Walmart everywhere, so finding another position isn't difficult.

"Bad management, catty employees","This was my first job ever and I took it as a last resort because I had applied to many other places first and had no luck. It’s Walmart, so what can you expect. It was an okay job to get my work experience started, but I learned I never want to work in retail again because I did not have a good experience with it here. I was the youngest employee by at least 20 years, and felt like the employees and managers in the department took advantage of me often because of it. I would rather shop at Walmart than work there. ",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Green Valley, AZ",5/6/21,2021,5,6
the worse company,They are the worse company I have ever worked for. The management system is horrible. They treat their employees like they are completely replaceable. they work you to death and there is no appreciation.,1,Former Employee,department manager ,"Spokane, WA",5/6/21,2021,5,6
Band management and favoritism/slander. Some good employees and breaks/benefits.,"Bad management and favoritism also lots of false accusations. Some great co-workers, but are often taken advantage of and belittled by management and favorites. Lots of unfair work loads. Breaks are nice and benefits, but that's all.",2,Former Employee,OPD ,"Marana, AZ",5/6/21,2021,5,6

"Lots of opportunity, if you can deal with the hassles.","Walmart can and will hire anybody at their retail stores who can stand or walk all day. The starting pay in my area is better than average for walking in the door knowing nothing.However, due to management or corporate, often problems evident to everyone are never fully corrected. Not enough people working in each department, equipment that often doesn't work correctly, and inconsistent rule enforcement is common. This deflates employee's enthusiasm and commitment to the company. In some cases, not mine fortunately, employees were told their days or hours off would be honored as agreed, then they were scheduled to work anyway. The employee was then not able to work another job, or care for a loved one, or go to class. When this happens, it explains the turnover.The upside is that they do often promote from within and I know of several fellow employees who have changed positions within our store. Many are happier in their new role. Most of the customers are great, and are patient enough if an issue can get resolved in a reasonable time. Most other employees are very helpful and I work with a lot of good people. If you can put up with the lack of support from management and corporate, you can really move up in this company. Not for me anymore, though, I'm planning on leaving.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Medina, OH",5/6/21,2021,5,6
Na,"It is fast paced, can be stressful. You're also working with the public so understand that your viewed as practically scum.

Cashier,being a cashier at walmart is the worst job experience I have had in my life. you stand the whole shift without the opportunity to take a breather its bad.,1,Former Employee,N/A ,"Houston, TX",5/6/21,2021,5,6
Depends on Location,"Walmart can definitely can be a fun and rewarding place to work at if you are young and just entering the work force. For me, it was just that. It didn't last as long as I would've liked due to poor management and rude supervisors but as the title says, I'm sure this was all due to location.",3,Former Employee,Grocery Associate ,"Locust Grove, GA",5/6/21,2021,5,6

Be prepared to really work for a living.,"Walmart the store is not a bad place to work if you have managers who are willing to talk to you and really listen, even when you mess up. I have been treated very well by my managers, but with never having enough workers despite all the hiring they do, I am constantly being pulled from my area to either be a cashier up front or clean other departments. If you don't like your department, that is fine, but I like mine. I like helping my customers so being forced to work somewhere else is frustrating. Also, Walmart the company is terrible. They never have the workers' best interests at heart, despite the commercials. Most people use Walmart as a job to have until they are hired for the job they really want, for good reasons.",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"South Bend, IN",5/6/21,2021,5,6

I mean it’s ok I guess,It would be better if they would stop changing things 50 million times just to go back to how they were doing it. It would be nice if the managers that are just sitting in the office listened to the associates that are actually doing the job about what’s best.,2,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"West Columbia, SC",5/6/21,2021,5,6
It’s An Okay Place To Work. ,Management Always Micromanaging & Being Passive Aggressive. Manager/Coach Acts Disrespectful Then Is Confused When People Speak Up For Themselves. My Store Location Was 1266 On Oneal Lane & Overnight Was Always Under Staffed. They Try & Stretch You Thin & Complain When Things Dont Get Done But It’s Impossible If You Dont Have Enough People. Also On Weekends We Would Only Have 7-11 People When Normally We Would Have 15-20 People Which Makes Its Extremely Difficult To Complete. ,2,Current Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Baton Rouge, LA",5/6/21,2021,5,6
Easy but annoying,The job is easy but sometimes the expectations are ridiculous if there is too much freight. Some managers are just absolutely worthless. The job gets really repetitive sometimes.,3,Current Employee,Stocker ,Ohio,5/6/21,2021,5,6
"In the beginning, yes. At the end, NO!","Heard Managers say ""display it and take their money"".  That go's for electronics. I was at Walmart for 15 years. Managers make way to much money and the only people who make what they deserve is the pharmacist. Christmas help, ha- your leaving in less then 90 days, who cares! Nothing to them unless you get hurt on the job and drag it out for 365 days! Still on the payroll. Now you know how to stay employed after the layoff. Some are hard working good people and better then the one's that are still there years later. So sad to see that happen to nice people that have no idea they are waiting for you to leave.    ",2,Former Employee,Asset Protection Coordinator ,Washington State,5/6/21,2021,5,6
They don’t pay what they promise. ,I worked there under the assumption that I would be paid the amount that was put in writing. When I got my first check it was something completely different and a lower amount. I brought it to my supervisor’s attention for 3 pay periods straight and nothing was done to fix it. I had to bring it to the store manager’s attention twice for something to be done about it. I later asked for a transfer to a store close to me and I was told be the store manager himself that my transfer was completely and to wait for the other store to reach out to me. That store never did because they never received a request for my transfer. That place is so unorganized and it lacks a real leader. ,1,Former Employee,OGP Associate ,"Coralville, IA",5/6/21,2021,5,6

Stressful and no support from management,Managers are usually unhelpful and unfriendly. Clear favoritism from managers is a big issue. Very little room for advancement in the company. Stressful work environment. Managers and customers treat associates as less than human most of the time. Very little raises. No hazard pay for pandemic and no holiday pay.

Horrible place to work,"Don't work here, it's a problem. You have to remind managers that your breaks were due hours ago and sometimes you just don't get one because they are so understaffed. Not to mention if you need a manager they are MIA. Immature and  underqualified management. Customers complain to you all day because the lines are long. You will be overworked every shift because they want to save labor costs. Also, during covid they make you SHARE a locker with a complete stranger....... thought a big corporation like Walmart would be a lot more organized than that. Shiesty company.

Better know it before you start working here.,NO training. Always about numbers. Complete 4 to 6 work orders a day. Potholes to mulch to deli fryers to tile to toilets to electric shopping cart....etc. You might get to call someone who may have one of these in their store but they might not have ever worked on one. Everything counts against you. Work order comes in on friday? you're off sat and sun? well when you start mon you're already 2 days behind.

"Production, production, production. You'll hear that a lot.","Let's be honest here, you're only interested in this place because you heard that they pay a lot. They do. Now for the reality, if it's hot outside, it's hot in there and vice versa. Mandatory overtime is a thing and if you're new, you will get the days no one else wants. All of these decisions are based on tenure or seniority.If you're a hard worker and think that you'll break out and be promoted sooner because you exceed production, you'll be sorely disappointed. I personally hit 180% production on a nightly basis, yet those there longer get first choice for transfer, promotions or choosing days to work mandatory overtime. There is absolutely zero incentive to exceed production.If you like a lot of overtime, this place will appeal to you but if you change your mind or want to change shifts, tough luck. The line is a mile long unless you choose a position that no one else wants, like unloading or order-filling; especially if you want first shift.",3,Former Employee,Reach Truck Operator 2nd Shift ,"Irvington, AL",5/5/21,2021,5,5

Profit driven so the associates are worked hard, they can be flexible with scheduling but they don't give sick time anymore",3,Current Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Arlington, TX",5/4/21,2021,5,4
terrible people,Walmart really is a terrible company to work for. Most of the employees have no idea what to do or where anything is because they’re all new. Management treats everyone terribly unless it’s an equal or higher up. Being a customer host at Walmart is also a little silly because no one in management cares for you since your job means nothing and costumers practically spit at you. Most costumers also tend to not understand that you get paid to do the job and you’re not secretly out to get them. ,1,Former Employee,Customer Host/Asset Protection ,"Middle River, MD",5/4/21,2021,5,4
Job Instability ,"Company was consistently going through a reorg,  there were a few every quarter. There is no work/life balance.  Management tells us repeatedly to take time off and reserve time with the family but then gives us extremely aggressive deadlines.",2,Current Employee,Senior Technical Program Manager ,"Sunnyvale, CA",5/4/21,2021,5,4
Dead end job,"At least at the store level, you are treated like a moron who needs to have their hand held through every thing. The pay is barely above min wage. I think the worst thing about it is their point system. I you miss a day, you get a point. After four points, you are subject to termination. That's fine, that's their policy, but management is constantly calling you in on days you aren't supposed to work and asking you to stay late, but those points from when you were sick with the flu stay there. ",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Springdale, AR",5/4/21,2021,5,4

Make sure you apply for a position with the Highest Wage,"It’s retail, that should say a lot about working at Walmart.  However, the experience depends a lot of the store management team.  What’s more Is the corporation has chosen to pay different groups of workers different base wages but still expects everyone in the store to work the whole store.  So, If you are in the lowest job band (like floor associate), you will end up working overnight’s leftover freight ($17) and online orders OGP: $15) and cashiering (they make $.50 more per hour) along with trying to get your own work done.  So if you don’t mind doing other people’s jobs making less than they do, then you’ll flourish at Walmart. ",2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Greeley, CO",5/4/21,2021,5,4

They are good on their CDC guidelines to make sure everyone is safe while working. I had a excellent group of co-workers and then their were a few that I just stayed away from. But most of them look out for each other. I do not like the fact the job is based on production, I feel like that kills team work in the shipping department because everyone is fighting for carts to get their high production numbers by the end of the night. You work 3 days a week (Sat-Mon) and off (Tues-Fri) can't beat that scheduled. You get paid bi-weekly.",5,Former Employee,Warehouse Worker/Shipping and Receiving ,"Williamsburg, VA",5/4/21,2021,5,4

“Hard Job”,"Let’s not beat around the bush. If you are not up for being on your feet for 12 hours, this isn’t the job for you. It’s easy “hard” work. You stack products onto pallets. Ranging from 50 pound dog food bags to 20 pound dog food bags. Tissues, paper products. Canned goods, flour. Even ramen noodles. My DC is great. People there helped me. All you gotta do is learn how to stack, where to place the items on your pallets. Paying attention is key. If you like sweating and waking up early in the morning. It’s for you. I’m 5’9 and I think it’s an easy job for the pay. Summer is coming up. I’m about to be out of my training curve. You HAVE to be fast. There’s a thing called percentages. When you are out of your curve you have to pull 100%. I’m pulling a 90%. It’s all about key placements. Not wasting time. It’s a fun job. You just gotta enjoy it.

2 year plan turned into 10,"This was a great place early on when I started, and the main corporate goal is to move up. This means if you find a job you love, don't expect to be there long term, something will change with the goal of making your job easier or remove the human element, outsource and replace you, or management will encourage you to move elsewhere, whether you want to or not. Other than that there are benefits in the form of a 401k, stock options, pto, maternity/adoption leave, $1/day certification classes, g.e.d. completion courses, these are things that can benefit a lot of people from a lot of different backgrounds.The pay has only gotten worse over the years, new hires are now making as much money as everyone who has worked there for a decade or more, and this is the biggest reason a lot of employees are looking elsewhere, Wal-Mart is always hiring, and constantly changing.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Missoula, MT",5/4/21,2021,5,4

Management and team leads can be hard to approach because you know how stressed they are. Pretty easy work, there’s just too much pressure to get more than you can done, especially if you have seniority among your co-workers.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Ephraim, UT",5/3/21,2021,5,3

I mostly loved it working in the toys section because the toys were interesting and changed a lot and I liked the customers.,"Usually it was fun to work there.  The bad part was sometimes when merchandise was on the floor because of rude lazy customers I would get yelled at and cussed at by a manager who would walk between all different sections of the Walmart for his job.  I cashiered a little bit also when it was busy which was easy.  I also worked at a register there to help with returns before which I liked and was easy.  My boss for my section was very nice.  I had a lot of back pain, though, from the job and so my back would even hurt on my days off from working in the Toys section.  If a customer wanted a certain toy we didn't have, I'd tell my manager to try to get it ordered which was something I liked.  I also liked helping in olher departments.",5,Former Employee,toys dept. sales associate ,"On South Loop 289 and Quaker Ave. in Lubbock, TX",5/3/21,2021,5,3
Overworked and unappreciated,"Shift managers are lazy and will make you do their job. Then you get in trouble with the higher ups for not doing your job.

Overall this place reeks,"Work life was always hectic, the managers only cared about their friends who ended up getting hired there, the pay is awful, the company treats us like cattle, nobody care about protecting workers during COVID.

Poor management,Management is incompetent and never there when you need them. Would rather rule through fear and punishment than actual leadership. Other than that it's okay.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Fort Smith, AR",5/2/21,2021,5,2
Walmart was okay to work for. It payed well for the position but all in all I enjoyed it. ,"Walmart’s management needs tons of work. They have their favorites and that dictates how they perceive you.

"Poor Management, they sat in office on top of desk,  tables, texting and shopping for the their online orders.

Beginner Job,"Had this as my first job. Very close to home so I didn't go far. Stuck as Greeter at door and didn't really interact/ see the store much. Pay was fair for 16 y/o.

Highly NOT recommended as a work place (cashier/front end),"The casher/front end positions have HORRIBLE management. They play favorites, letting select few employees come and go as they please. These select few get multiple paid shopping and cigarette breaks. Management just stands there watching and criticizing you while you struggle to keep up with busy moments and skipped breaks. Yes that is correct. It's not fair, but that is how the front end management works. Breaks are ALWAYS late and most you have to beg for. Most managers are snippy and very unhelpful. When asking for help you get called names and criticized. ",1,Current Employee,Front End Associate ,"Plattsburgh, NY",5/2/21,2021,5,2
Yikes,"Don't do it, there were a few good coworkers that made the job somewhat tolerable but most of the time it was awful.

An alright first job if you have good managment,"Good management can make or break the difference when working here. I had good management when I first began working, but since WalMart is known not to keep good employees they left and then had bad management  takeover and it went down hill from there.

Nice workplace always something new to learn,"Lots of opportunities, college for a dollar a day, 401k, great benefits. Walmart doesn’t just have cashiers and door greaters, there’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes. If you don’t like the position you have at the moment you can always put in an application for another and stay with the same company. Plenty of things to learn. If you open an account with Woodforest for your 401k they’ll double it. Plus you get paid a few days earlier.

Most Toxic Work Environment ,"Had incompetent HR leaders, and nobody cared about their job and made sure everyone knew.  Also had people try to fight in front of me and then act like school kids when the manager came back.  These people act like children and is not the best environment for a mature adult who just wants to work.

An okay place to work for,"The Walmart I was at was consistently low staffed, half our managers weren’t that great at the job, but most of them were nice and cared, I really liked how the schedule was made 3 weeks at a time, I enjoyed being able to plan my month out. The computer system was easy and fun to use. Most of the time customers were rude and unkind. Now that i’m working a different job I am extremely grateful for the breaks and lunches every 2 hours.

Somewhat Decent,"I was hired on during the rise of COVID-19 in May 2020.

Horrible management but amazing starting pay,"The management is not good. They overwork you, don't allow you to request days off, and scold you for every little thing you do. You are given a department to stock and a time limit on how fast you need to stock it. The time they give us is always 30-90 minutes shorter than we actually need. Our times are super short and almost no one can make them. The worst part is that we could still get yelled at for meeting our times because other departments weren't finished.

Walmart management team does not communicate with each other before giving direction to their associates.,"One manager will tell you one day that this way is how you do something and the next day another one is telling you that you're doing wrong and threatening to coach you. I used to enjoy my job at Walmart, but after a little over ten years I have seen so many changes for the worse and more of a work load is continually being added. No matter how much they add they expect you to get it done faster but never take into consideration stopping to help customers. They will coach you for productivity and no matter the reason they always say it's an excuse. ",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Union, SC",5/1/21,2021,5,1
Fast paced and entertaining.,"If you work inside to collect groceries its fast paced, and detail oriented with selecting the products. If you work outside to deliver the groceries to the cars then its super fast paced and you should bring multiple types of clothing for all weather elements. I’m a hefty guy but no slouch and had a sweat rag with me because you will be out there moving all day in high heat and super cold temperatures. The only time it slows down is if there is lightning.

A great place to work as an in-between or if you're wanting generalized skills.,"For clarification, I was hired by my original managers because I ""sounded intelligent"" and had good general computer skills, not for things on my resume, and certainly not for my speed.When I started, the company had great ethics, benefits, and a great pay rate compared to my first job. Over the years, the workload has increased drastically, the teams I was on dropped in population significantly, and the pay has barely compensated for the ""bare minimum"" workload as it is currently. A large focus for the company as it stands now requires more focus on speed while ""maintaining"" quality, and new managers, as I have seen recently, don't have the same knowledge or information that a manager normally would.I could go on and on about specifics without breaking confidentiality, but to summarize it as much as possible, the only way that a job here will be worth your time is if you have a genuine want to help people in your community and the people you work alongside mesh well with the team you get put on. Great management helps significantly too.",3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Hampton, VA",5/1/21,2021,5,1

A company being killed by greed,"Wal-Mart used to be a good company to work for, according to the people I've worked with. After the founder passed away and his children took over, they decided to cut every corner in the endless pursuit of more money. Wal-Mart is shifting all of its money into online grocery shopping, but neglecting to pay for more staffing in important areas like cashiers, stockers, unloaders, cart pushers, etc.Every couple of years Wal-Mart will roll out a new vision that is about canning as many people as possible to save the CEO and board members a couple bucks, while the stores languish in awful staffing. If you get a job at Wal-Mart, expect to do the work of 5 people but get paid for 1. You'll be treated poorly the entire time, too.",1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Latrobe, PA",5/1/21,2021,5,1

The only good department to work in in my opinion is ogp,The management team doesn't know what they are doing half the time. If u are a transfer it can take weeks to months to get in the system. They make false promises and give you false information. Very frustrating. Also values aren't great. Was working at midlothian walmart in Texas on online grocery and loved it!

It's walmart,"Customers will treat you like the bottom of the barrel, management will treat you like a slave if you show you're a hard worker and let lazy employees get away with doing nothing while praising them for working hard.

All about how the company (Store Manager) looks on paper.,"The Walmart I worked at was all about the bottom line, or, more specifically, looking good on paper.

Ok,"I have worked in ecommerce for two years and it has been an overall ok experience.  I have had some great lower/mid-level managers that I feel truly cared about the employees, however upper management overall feels the exact opposite and often promotes favorites rather than the most qualified.  The pay is decent for what the job is and I have made some great friendships however the job can be stressful as we are almost always understaffed and very few are willing to pick up the slack, leaving a select few to keep things from falling apart.

"Great Coworkers and pay , Garbage management","I honestly loved going to work every day to see my coworkers and most customers but management made the job unbearable at times such as throwing their task on to you and writing you up if things weren't complete or if one person messes up everyone gets a write up. 2 write ups cost you from transferring to stores, different departments or moving up. I had never been writing up in 15 years of being at walmart yet this year times have changed. Management has gotten worse and worse. I would consider going back if management is fired.

I've even asked for full time and the manager always tells me ""we'll talk about it,"" and that's been two months of me asking. I have bills and have to buy groceries and hardly have money for both. You might get full time temporarily but that's it. They'll give lazy people full time before the people who actually need it. And I'm a current employee. They just don't want people to have health care and i guess the managers need their bonus more than they care for there employees. Most of the time, you'll work alone, just depending on what department you're in when it's a two or three person job. Even the manager won't help even though they say we have things to do.

"Dull, boring, stressful work place.","Working at Walmart is full of stress, managers have no respect for associates, a lot of retaliation. In one word ""modern slavery"". employees for Walmart's managers are like tools, the best employee at Walmart is the one who has no humanly needs; being sick or going to LOA or vacation is a crime, empathy or sympathy has no concept at Walmart;  there is no balance between work and family as if you dedicate your life to Walmart. Workplace culture is: Service to the Customer, Respect for the Individual, Strive for Excellence and Act with Integrity which is good if apply, but the only thing happening is Service to the customer, there is no respect for individual and no integrity, no matter how hard you work, how productive you are, you are never good enough to be count as excellence, they do not respect diversity, they step on your way and make a hard time for you to not let you get promoted they do everything possible, even changing your data, your personal file, your job code, and your job title illegally, in one word the will use the managerial tools and power to suppress to stop you and push you back. There is a kind of unfair manager solidarity against employees, managers fool you, lie to you, there are favoritism and discrimination, and no real support from a home office; I would say Walmart supports retaliation. The hardest part of the job is approaching a manager to ask something, and the most enjoyable part of the job is to clock out.Never Work for Walmart if you want to be treated fairly, and entitled to your time and vacation and family without stress.(To be fair ""The - more...",1,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate and Financial Services ,"Temple, TX",4/29/21,2021,4,29

Strong disconnect from higher-ups to those working in stores,"Working at Walmart is fine. Coworkers are nice for the most part. They have some nice perks, such as offering low-cost education and a 401k match. Base pay is not enough. They raise the wages for some people in the store but not for others, which is very frustrating and makes me feel dispensable, especially with how hard I (and my coworkers) have worked throughout the pandemic. I am not given proper tools to do my job efficiently-- for example, the computer I need to use all day has very outdated software and is way too slow. Being given the correct tools to do your job should be the bare minimum. There needs to be a lot of changes for the Vision Center to stay relevant, such as new technology, a change in what it looks like (mine looks very outdated), better deals, etc. They make very questionable business decisions that don't seem data-based that make me wonder if they have ever actually stepped foot in a vision center. In addition, rather than spending money on an actual marketing team for the vision center, they expect us to make our own advertisements. ",3,Current Employee,Optician ,Utah,4/28/21,2021,4,28

It's ok,"     Job life heavily depends on which department you end up going into, and everyone likes different departments. In OGP, the experience is fun and feels worthwhile if the staffing is sufficient. If not, it becomes a serious headache. Not that you should feel inclined to get one, but because you'll be astounded by how silly the managers are by not hiring enough people to get the job done.       The upper management for this company is getting worse as time goes on. A successful store shouldn't be throwing out Code Sparks 8 times a day. That's usually a sign that the store is going under, because then you'll have associates from understaffed departments be pulled to the front. Who is going to help Uncle Jarry purchase his TV now? Nobody. Good job. ",2,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Madison, AL",4/28/21,2021,4,28

Cashiers, stockers, csms, those positions usually get a lot of hours cause they're the face of the company.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Fort Worth, TX",4/28/21,2021,4,28
No communication between departments daily,"Good job, room for advancement .

Long hours but great money ,"The job is what it is, if you work hard and don't slack off there will be no issues.

Big workplace with loads to do! Just no one to tell you to do it.,"Management is bad. I cant tell you a time i would go to work at walmart again. They are rude and are NOT flexible whatsoever.

"People were nice, pay was on the lower end. ","Pay was on the lower end, got hired during the pandemic at a higher rate then was going to have to take a pay cut after the summer was over.

"Honestly Not Bad, Just Needs to Pay More","I was a department manager for several years and honestly enjoyed my work. Management mostly left me alone to do what I needed to do. Walmart is eternally understaffed (and they're always finding new and creative ways to cut payroll) but you basically just do what you can. It's not a super stressful job (unless you're upper management, in which case it's *extremely* stressful), but the pay isn't great either.",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Houston, TX",4/28/21,2021,4,28
Working with Walmart was an experience that had its benefits but I would not recommend!,"No work/life balance, if you are a friends with management, you may move up in the company, PAY SUCKED, you may get fired for any reason! 9 out of 10 would not recommend!",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Fort Worth, TX",4/28/21,2021,4,28
They have flexible scheduling.,You meet lot's of interesting people and learn lot's of new skills. The pay is pretty good. Awesome 1st time job. You can transfer locations or positions in the store. If you like being around the public and helping people this would be a very good place to work.,4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Bonney Lake, WA",4/28/21,2021,4,28
Bad Place,"High school environment, unprofessional managers who expect you to have open availability upon their request. Was often called to come in to work on the 1 day off I had.

"Good place to work, but managers have a lot of favoritism","Im a cashier and I didn't really mind my job, yes I constantly get really rude customers but it teaches me a lot of patience. The managers are kind of always all over the place so it's hard to get a hold of them when you need something. Also, I constantly have to remind them of the days i'm not available for work, I am a college student so this job makes my life even harder because the managers have me scheduled to close most of the time, which hardly leaves any time for school work. They also like to switch me around the store a lot, if they don't need cashiers they'll have me doing another departments go backs or will have me help another department with their job.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Victorville, CA",4/28/21,2021,4,28

Awful workplace,"Worked in the pharmacy. Policies were awful, training was non-existent. Experienced technicians looked down on new techs and couldn't be bothered to deviate from their desired tasks - leading to new techs being overloaded with grunt work. Pharmacists often turned a blind eye to experienced techs overstepping the limits of their certification. ",1,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,Kentucky,4/27/21,2021,4,27
Auto Care Center Tech: good place to work until they call you into the grocery store,"I work in the Auto Care Center. The ACC is a great place to work in itsself, however often times a manager will come along and ask if we have any staff to spare to push buggies or work other departments. So don't come expecting to work ACC without having to working inside the grocery store as well.",3,Current Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Pelham, AL",4/27/21,2021,4,27
Great entry level job,"Worked there during the covid lockdown. It was a ton of freight and not enough pay. One of my managers was disgruntled and used all his pto and covid pay claim before leaving for good. It made for a really bad introduction. The Human Resources employee was venting to me about how she is quitting and leaving during my orientation. So there i was doing twice as much getting paid four dollars less than the last guy. At a later time walmart reduced its managers to ""coaching"" positions and there was no managers and really not a whole lot of room for growth. A lot of the employees are related to each other or dating each other. If someone messes up just let management take care of it because you never know who you are getting trouble. It was just weird.But yeah! For a side gig it can be a stable hustle. If you are young and want to build credit and need job experience. You will never make over 40k a year here tho",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Edgewood, NM",4/27/21,2021,4,27

No ones accountable,No ones accountable. Manager don’t respond for customer assistance. Employees take double and triple timed breaks. Some employees walk around all day accomplishing nothing. Working hard gets you no where except used. The photo lab has no system of organization. Very frustrating finding customer orders.

"Racist, ridiculous expectations",I was literally told that they expected dedication to the level of they expected you to be at work unless you died. They told a story about a lady who died on the operating table and then came in for her shift. Just complete bs. The whole culture is bs. I and several other minorities dealt with racism and workplace toxicity. I honestly cannot recommend this company any less.,1,Former Employee,Stocker/Customer Service ,"Oklahoma City, OK",4/27/21,2021,4,27
A solid place to work,"I worked in the grocery section of the store for 2 years. Regardless of age or situation, Walmart is a solid place to work.

Overall, I’d recommend applying.",4,Former Employee,Frozen/Dairy Associate ,"Nitro, WV",4/27/21,2021,4,27
Good place to work temporarily ,"I enjoyed the job, the hours kinda sucked. Its easy for some to get promoted, impossible for others.

"Horrible Management, treated me very poorly.","I was hired at Walmart to progress into a full time employee, only to not be given a vest after over 2 months of working there, and for them to totally forget some bonuses that they had promised.

Best part of the job is going home ,"Don’t bother trying to work hard because theyre just going to give the promotion to the ones who suck up the most . On top of that . If you’re even a little competent, expect to do the work load of 3 while everybody else stands around and twiddles their thumbs . If you want anything done your best bet is to skip the chain of command and head straight to personnel.

Good depending on the department you work in very easy to get fired if you’re late or absent from work,My rating is based on maintenance position.

"Good benefits, sometimes toxic work environment ","There are great people who work here, however respect for the individual needs to be followed. I feel like that is my biggest complaint that it can be a sometimes toxic work environment. People in leadership positions shouldn't be calling other employees names, and I've seen that happen far too many times.The pay though I feel is very fair, and you get a decent amount of pto if you're full time and been with the company for a couple years.

The friendships you make are the best part,"I don't know about other walmart stores but our store in moulton,al is not supportive of its employees at all.. Management  is not on  the same page. You may ask one a question and get one answer and ask another and get a different answer.  You have the associates  that are lazy and don't care that get away with anything  and then the ones who bust their butts and put so much heart in what their doing and they get no appreciation  or are watched and judged for every little thing. I worked there for 5 1/2 yrs     and I had a issue  come up that I disagreed  with our ap guy even tho I NEVER had any disciplinary  actions on my record or any write ups i ended up getting terminated and they terminated another associate for one of the stupidest reasons  I ever heard of.

"Good Pay, horrible work life balance","Overall if you do not mind not having a life outside of work it is good. The company has invested heavily in new technology such as applications which keep you super connected however management as a whole is very disposable. Hourly associates are taken care of very well but if you are management expected to work past your scheduled shift as you are always connected, days can be 12+ hours, not uncommon to have to work on your days off, and your schedule is ever changing. Plenty of room for advancement if you are driven and that is what you want but be ready to put the work in. ",3,Former Employee,manager ,"Central Valley, CA",4/26/21,2021,4,26

"Mostly good, some bad","All locations are different. The location I worked at has great management. They recently restructured their management as well as associate groups, which gave us a set schedule. That said, it’s difficult to get a day off other than the set ones due to “no coverage”.

Flexible Hours For Students,I worked at a Walmart SuperCenter for about a year and a half. I enjoyed it because you get to work with a lot of diverse people who shared their life stories with me. I worked in our garden center and enjoyed the overall atmosphere. However everything is affected by management and the new shift to team based management was not successful in my store.

Pay is decent while some jobs in the DC aren't too bad. Everything else is garbage though. ,"It pays well at least for my area. My job itself is easy and many within the DC are but starting off new as a order filler can be hard. Most don't make it past this point but if you can the jobs are much easier and pay well. Management is like a revolving door as well as most new hires. The people that do stay tend to be pretty decent but only stay for the money. Having to work only 3 days is nice until your only working 6 hour shifts everyday. This cuts into the good pay at times but makes up for it when they do overtime during busy season. Good job for someone needing too work odd hours or young people that want to work without an education and make decent money. Wouldn't recommend most jobs as careers. Pay cap is it relatively fast and doesn't increase outside of the occasional raise given to everyone so getting ""stuck"" in the job can be easy with no career paths or better salaries few and far between.

Was great when I started. ,When I started the company still had a grass roots culture and integrity. Found out quickly after moving to another state that the company was different from store to store. Store I thought I transferred from never sent my file or did any of the transfer process personnel director told me it was done. Got to the store in Florida had no idea who I was. Called the store I moved from they claimed I never worked there this was when we had paystubs I said where did I get these from.         New store made things right but then after 2006 it all went down hill. Should’ve left at that time. Instead stuck it out for another another ten years.

Don’t bother.,"This place is absolutely insane. No matter what store you are in, the management is terrible. This is a corporation, they do not care about you, your health, or your family. You are punished for being sick, often told that you can’t leave if you are sick, or unfortunately like me, are “voluntarily terminated” after having Covid and continuously trying to call the store multiple times, every single day, to be ignored or hung up on and never being able to get a hold of any type of management or higher up.

Terrible.,"The job itself isn’t bad, the main problem here is management and how little they care about their employees. At my location, there’s been multiple times when we’ve had to either cancel orders or have ridiculous wait times because we don’t have enough people to dispense or pick the orders. Despite this, management keeps increasing our order limit because this leads to them getting bonuses even if they know we don’t have enough people or equipment to get those orders ready and therefore cause terrible stress on all of us. There’s always new people because everyone ends up quitting and this leads to so many mistakes that just make us get behind. The training is a joke, they just have new people shadow us for a day and then they’re on their own after that. Management acts like they’re there to help but will yell and get frustrated when someone makes a mistake. One of the managers is always yelling and being rude to dispensers when they’re behind on wait times and instead of helping or finding a way to get caught up, she just throws a fit and leaves. Don’t even get me started on the favoritism, it’s ridiculous. So many people that are close to the managers get to do whatever they want, they even disappear for long periods of time and no one says anything. This job is just not worth it, unless you really need a job then I would suggest looking elsewhere. ",2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Tucson, AZ",4/24/21,2021,4,24

Just a paycheck,They will hire anyone that applies and you get some shady people working their.  The people that work hard get taken advantage of and given more work.  The lazy people they just leave alone.  Everyone gets a 2 percent raise increase yearly which is pretty pathetic. It is set up so the long term employees make less money. So it does not matter how hard you work because you get the same raise as the lazy people.  The raise structure used to be different and more rewarding.  The long term employees basically got their annual raises cut in half so Walmart could pay new hires a higher hourly wage. Walmart did a great job of cutting benefits along the way and also eliminating half of the management to SAVE$  Every employee is a number now.  If Sam Walton were alive none of this nonsense would be going on.  Used to be a good company to work for but has gotten real bad over the last few years.

"Productive, fun, interactive job",I would highly recommend working at Walmart. I feel that the supervisors usually take pride in their jobs and are great leaders.

Typical Retail,"My coworkers were the nicest people ever, even some of the managers. But the problem is more with the company itself that makes it awful. Anyone who had sympathy always seemed miserable, and it was understandable. If you question any unfair practices you are met with some loophole that allows it, told that its company policy, or treated like you're just being lazy. Severely understaffed. You are tasked with both cashiering, cleaning, reshopping, trash duty, etc, all at once. Even if its too busy to maintain any of that. Overtime is not allowed without approval in advance, but you are not allowed to leave your post unless you are told to, which can go over the end of your shift. Everything is decided by the head office, even if it makes no sense. You are essentially not human in their eyes. Flexible scheduling makes it hard to make plans outside of work, and you only get Christmas off as a garunteed holiday. Randomly selected shifts make it hard to get to know coworkers because you'll rarely get the same hours/breaks. Due to understaffing, you are made to feel guilty for taking allowed breaks, or for needing to leave due to sickness or injury. Because this means some other poor soul has to do extra work. The benefits mostly go back into Walmart's wallet. The bonuses are usually in the form of 10% off coupons that are only good for 1 week. The company uses your own sympathy against you, while making you feel like your asking too much.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,New York State,4/23/21,2021,4,23

As I grew with the company and became a manager myself I noticed why some of management was the way they were. I was not that type of manager, which was why I didn’t last. I could not be a robot with the system. I had feelings and I knew my associates did too.

The schedule was nice but in the end it’s all about production,"Order filling for Walmart DC 7077 was soul sucking mindless repetitive work. The managers are constantly looking for reasons to write people up for not meeting safety and productivity goals. Definite preferential treatment of their “veteran” order fillers. The only time I got 40 hours was in training, they were going to transfer me after not meeting my learning curve but let me go instead. No windows in the building and no camaraderie among other employees. In the end manager for FDD shipping suggested that I should write a letter of resignation if I couldn’t raise my productivity by 30% by the end of my work week.

Even during peak hours like lunch rush & of course the supervisors are no where to be found to help out, only to scream at you if something didn’t get done while all of that was going on. They have unrealistic expectations that one person can properly close the entire deli by themselves & do it right. Which is why there is such a high turnover rate of people quitting.

Contradicting management/Mixed messages and No Accountability,"No one is held under any form of accountability, managers constantly contradict what they say so it gives the associates mixed messages and we can’t work as a team because of it. One person allowed to get away with safety hazard issues while others are punished for breaking the same rules. It’s pathetic and poorly managed.

Hard work,They don't give you the tools to achieve the unexpected goal they set for you. Many employees I work with has been with walmart for at least 15 to 25 years and today they are tellung me it's never been this bad. Walmart works the employees like a production line. You have to be done at a certain time or you get written up. Although we have customers to help or wait till there done shopping in the area were working or we have to travel across the store. It's.

Worst experience. ,"I'm a teenager. got hired easy since I got little experience, this is the only pro.. managers r all over the place. can't ever find them. and u can imagine how  often customers ask for managers! I have to regularly run around the store looking for them because this massive corporation can't afford walkie talkies!! when I got hired and didn't get my schedule I had to come in 5 times in a row because I couldn't find a manager to give me my schedule. most of the coworkers r very nice ppl, and I can say the same for most of the managers. except one. he regularly made innapropriate remarks towards me and my other minor coworkers. pay is minimum wage, I've multiple times heard of my older coworkers begging for a raise because they had no money. back rooms r pretty bad, and ur expected to do more work than ur paid. I have often times 8 hour shifts and I'm not allowed to sit down (I worked at self checkout and as a cashier). like I said, best part is the coworkers. they r chill and we always cover each other to take longer breaks. customers r usually creeps or annoying ",2,Former Employee,Self Checkout Host/Cashier ,"Pleasanton, CA",4/22/21,2021,4,22
yey,"I consider myself more of a scholar and get fulfillment from intellectually-stimulating tasks; Not holding a lot by way of experience in construction. Though a large portion is exercise, a lot of thought goes into making things come together. This company provided me a great opportunity to learn. I miss school: Research papers, trigonometry assignments, physics labs, exams, libraries... Yet, this has gifted me an outlet to use some of my skills I acquired there. That is, there are some problems to solve that aid in the stimulation of that itch from time to time. I have to be grateful for the fact that it's far superior than asking someone ""Paper or plastic?"" all day long in that regard.The people are the best part of Walmart though. They work hard, but they know how to have fun through getting their work done. Sometimes things get stressful or chaotic. Sometimes tensions can flare a bit, but we're always a team that will make it all come together. When tensions do arise, I notice reconciliation is just around the corner in most cases, and we end up all getting along at the end of most every shift.

Walmart Only Cares About the Almighty Dollar,"In all my retail experience, never have I worked at a more mis-managed and dumpster fire of a store than the Bloomington Walmart. “Team” Associates (sales floor) are expected to do the work of the management above them without the pay, and are constantly forced to fill voids in areas they are not trained in or properly compensated for. “Leads” are expected to do the job of both a department manager over multiple departments (or areas) as well as the tasks of an Assistant Manager (Coach) without proper compensation station. Coaches are run ragged from one end of the store to the other doing the job that all the call-ins we’re supposed to be doing, as well as somehow managing the staff under then and dealing with problematic customers and scenarios. No one is happy. I’ve never witnessed such a low morale. You aren’t compensated enough to make a decent living unless you move up to a Lead or Coach, and when you do you are then overworked and forced into ridiculous hours and schedules, making it impossible to maintain a life outside of your workday. It’s nearly impossible to plan for routine appointments, and emergencies resulting in an absence give you “points” which add up against you, leading to disciplinary action or termination. There is no camaraderie or teamwork. No encouragement. Only constant promises that it will improve at some point. Customers comment on the daily that this location is the worst Walmart that they have ever shopped. This is the store deemed where Walmart “sends managers to drive them to quit”.

"Horrible place to work. Low wages, insane expectations, no management support",Walmart is a terrible place to work. The pay scale is ridiculously low and the expectations for work completed is very high. There is little to no management support unless something goes wrong then management looks to fix the blame rather then fix the problem. They pull every trick in the book to make sure you stay below 38 hrs (full time employee eligible for benefits etc..)Most workers are short term (see above for reasons) so there is no chance to build a team.Getting basic tools to complete your assigned work requires herculean effort.If your a supervisor good luck. Its next to impossible to hold your direct reports accountable. You are expected to run short handed and still deliver on the crazy amount of work set for you on any given day.If you MUST get a job this place can tide you over for a few weeks but working here long term is unrewarding in any and all instances.,1,Former Employee,Logistics supervisor ,"Panama City Beach, FL",4/21/21,2021,4,21

You could do worse.,"Pleasantness of the job depends entirely on who you're working with and how stressed the managers are that day.

A great place to work without prior job experience,"I have worked at Walmart for 2 years, and in that time have gone from cashier, service desk, sporting goods associate, to a front end team lead. It is a great place to move up without a degree or work experience. However the high you go, the more time conducive it is, and the less social live you have. It eventually comes to the point where all you do is work, as your schedule flip flops from day to day.",4,Current Employee,Front End Team Lead ,"Springfield, MO",4/20/21,2021,4,20
"Decent pay, need incentive to stay after 2yr wage cap.","Walmart will be around. I like the job security. I'm proud to say the DC I work at has hired a lot of veterans. Warehouse work is hard, but the starting wage is over 18.00 now. They promote mostly from within, and if you don't want a managment job you could always go into a fixed position like I did. EHS associate is a great job!!! My only Con is that you cap out pay at 2 years. The only way to get a raise is if they do a cost of living increase. Inflation is 3% and we might get .20-.35 a year...maybe. If they wanted better retention they should give raises every milestone. maybe at 5, then every year after that or every other year. No incentive to stay. ",4,Current Employee,EHS Specialist ,"Sanger, TX",4/20/21,2021,4,20

"Terrible Management, not worth the time","The management is absolutely terrible. They play favorites on who they want to succeed and only let advancements happen if it is company required (like yearly bonuses that no longer happen).

Low-level supervisors aren’t very professional.But overall, there is no tolerance for discrimination. It is possible to make friends. No real cutthroat politics as long as you pull your weight.

Great for a part time.,"I was with the company for16 years. The company has changed tremendously. To compete with other retail companies Walmart has changed from the core values Sam Walton started the company with. It is no longer a company for the associates. Associates lost a lot of the benefits it had that set it apart from other retail companies. It is fairly easy to move up in the company and get into the management program. Just beware the higher up you go the less life balance you will have. There is a lot of politics as you advance. When I left the company, it was going through a lot of company restructure. A lot of position being deleted and new ones created. I do not regret my time with them for I learned a lot from them. Hardest part is sometimes the few very unpolished Karen's that come in or the stress of getting things done. You have learn to multi task and be very good at time management.

You're easily replaceable,"This is a great company for young driven individuals who wants to gain experience in a management position. However, you'll quickly learn that you're just another number & you're easily replaced. I worked as a Team Lead Front End for 2 years and I was responsible for the firing and the re hiring. Once you've made a mistake, management/Coach/ Team Lead will watch your every move. Once they've decided you're not fit for the company, they'll find any dirt on you to replace you. But that's exactly how you survive in a management position. Cooperate encourages us not to build relationships with employees. You're suppose to keep track of mistakes, you're suppose to make others feel useless. They make us encourage each other to "" work together"" & become ""one best way"". But when it comes down to it, either you sink or swim. You're just expected to know everything with little or no training.The nice, kind, leaders are the ones that fails.

My experience ,No decent benefits unless your full time status. Can be a few years until your full time. Management would rather see you struggle then help most departments.

Never shown any recognition always asking for more from me ,I go above and beyond to achieve my goals every day working at Walmart. I never get any sort of “good job” or “thank you”. The only thing I get is “can you do that faster?” Or non-constructive criticism. The management is a joke. They all feel very entitled and will spread your business around the whole store if you come to them with and issue or problem. They are extremely petty and do little things to get back at you here and there. Sometimes it’s to the point where I’ve thought about just walking out. This job itself wouldn’t be bad if management got a wake up call on how to treat their employees with compassion and respect. They also gave me a “promotion” with a lot of increased responsibility to juggle around with absolutely no increase in pay.

Since the internet’s grasp on retail sales has been increasing the ideaology of the work culture has been changing as well. The focus is to get more productivity from each employee .

A constant revolving door of unhappy employees,"The last location I worked at had a problem with employee retention. There were lots of positions open at many times in the store in various locations, but this was due to the fact that people were either leaving positions for other ones or quitting the company entirely. There were multiple members of upper management who had glaring issues with ""respect for the individual"" and/or confidentiality policies, however even with escalated complaints to home office, little to nothing was ever done. Position expectations for individual employees changed on the daily and were often overloaded on those who could be depended on to come in and do what was needed regularly.

In ogp no real support to get orders dispensed or picked. They are always pulling entire store staff to pick orders(leaving no one to stock other store freight)  but usually having just one person dispensing leading to 8 cars outside to pick up orders and usually just one person to dispense the orders when there should be at least 4 people minumum. Had to beg to get help and usually there was no one willing to help. Poor communication and you only hear negative things from them. We are constantly receiving complaints about ogp because we are behind most of the time due to the excessive amount of orders with basically no one to pick and dispense the orders especially during the weekday.

Very productive and rather fast paced work environment. Good for young people getting a foot in the door. ,"A typical night at work was fast paced. The worst part about it was laying down on the floor, spraying stripper under the shelves then having to scrape up all the built up wax and dust. The best part was being able to come together as a team and get the store looking new. I've learned that walmart is definitely looking to recruit younger people coming out of high school these days. The workplace culture was pretty much just do your job right and respect others. It was simple but perfect. My experience with management was amazing.

I got let go because a previous employer reported I had a preventative accident. Which there is a lot to that story . Walmart has their rules I understand they want the best driving for them.

High Turnover 👎,"They make you push orders over 100pds which isn't in the job description. Description says lifting 60pds max.

Theyre only nice to you your first week, after that you don't exist. Very miserable environment. Nobody likes this job, they just show up for a check.

If you need specific times of the week off to watch the kids, spend time with family, go to school, doctors appointments, whatever... Walmart will work with you.Can’t say every other aspect of the company isn’t going downhill though. Find it absurd that new hires working on CAP are making more than the people who work their tails off in the pharmacy... There’s a lot of workplace inequality.

Dwindling Staffing,"Wal-Mart has the ability and the promise of being a great place to work. However the culture they preach is very different from the culture that actually exists within the store. I've been in four different management roles - all hourly - and salary members of management have only had their responsibilities taken away for my time here. Every couple years we get a new restructure or some sort of shuffle of whos responsible for what and every year during this restructure the amount of staffing to do the job is cut as well. In the most recent change we went from having an hourly management team of around 30 people down to 11, in the promise that ""Teams"" would be filled in accordingly and be specialized in bigger areas of the store. It's just a very oppressive, demoralizing place to work that doesn't see it's associates as anything more than a tool to be abused and discarded when no longer useful.",1,Current Employee,Team Lead ,OH,4/14/21,2021,4,14

"Good pay but don't work here, specially during covid.",They promise all the benefits and all the amazing things Walmart has to offer.

Quality of your development as an employee and work experience depends on management at your store.,"The quality of working for Walmart as an hourly associate, manager or salaried manager depends entirely on the upper management culture at the specific store you work at. No matter what, with the current changes coming down from corporate, work will be chaotic every day and you have to respond to the chaos as best as you can, which is common in most retail jobs, but is getting worse at Walmart in 2020 during the changes to management.If you can get into a store that is well managed, then you'll have an opportunity to learn, promote and grow within the company. It will always be a high stress job to manage or work easily if you work hard and socialize, but how manageable that is will change dramatically if you find yourself in one of the many stores that are poorly managed.A Walmart store with poor upper management can be absolutely vicious and a high-school level political minefield to work in. Some stores can absolutely be soul-draining as you work hard just to have salaried managers steal credit for your work or blame you for their own mistakes. The amount of work required for some Team Lead roles such as overnight are so heavy that you're truly better off finding another management position at another company for higher pay to go with the workload and pace of the job. $22 an hour to run an entire shift by yourself while simultaneously performing extremely physical work while fighting just to have working equipment just isn't high enough, which is why I decided to take my skills elsewhere.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Team Lead ,"Crosby, TX",4/14/21,2021,4,14

If you want college paid for, that benefit is great.  If you want to buy stock, they will contribute some.  You got to know people to get ahead.

Unfair and toxic,Walmart is getting worse. Costumers have to self check. The employees are being forced to work within a certain time frame there is no putting in your availability there. There are 3 times 7am-4pm which seniority gets those times first and then there’s 11am-8pm and anything left from seniority gets those. And the last is 3pm-12pm so all of the new hires and young college students get those and also the ones who actually work hard and want to learn more. Also cashiers are only 11$ an hour while the rest of the store gets 16$ ,1,Current Employee,Front End Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",4/13/21,2021,4,13

Worst management ever,"The management is so unfair, rude, and entitled. I  enjoy working there but they drive you to quit or fire you for any reason they can find.

They only care about impressing higher management for the money not appreciating us as their associates",1,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Concord, NC",4/11/21,2021,4,11
Been in 13 stores and each one is different.   Worth it if you don't want to be owned but like hourly advancement,"Company has changed so much in last 13 years.   Loved working in NH and PA but mass nearly killed my soul.   Associates are great, its certain management within regions that become too ""clicky"".  Tending to eliminating core personnel to boost bottom line.   Sad to see people go but change is inevitable.   ",4,Former Employee,Had many ,"Quincy, MA",4/11/21,2021,4,11
Jobs would be fairly easy if management were better. ,"They don’t hire within, so the company management team is not on the same level. That causes other people to not work productively.

Does not care about their employees ,Working there you get strikes. 5 strikes and you get fired. I do think this is a good policy but on 2 occasions I got stroked for leaving early because I have a diagnosed migraine issue and prescribed medicine for it. I talked to my manager and they said they cannot make exceptions. This led to me leaving. ,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Oak Ridge, TN",4/11/21,2021,4,11
"Government, obviously, labels it ""essential"" during pandemic.","Government, wrongly, forced my employer to lay us off due to pandemic fears.

The life of Walmart,Do not waist your time. Everything is a shi*t show.  Management don't care. Get talked to like a child if you let them. Management forgets to give you your break or you have to page over 5 times to remind them that you need your lunch or 15 minute break. Management is full of young people...which means a lot of immaturity. I can go on and on...,1,Current Employee,Customer Sevice Host ,"Eastlake, OH",4/11/21,2021,4,11

Sometimes an ok job,Ive been at Walmart for almost a year. And it has gone down hill alot in that time. I really enjoyed my job the start.

Staff makes or breaks it ,"The job itself is easy, the management that you get stuck with and the co-workers for your individual department ultimately decide the day-to-day experience that you're going to have. For the pay, the jobs are easy and quick to pick up and learn.",4,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Glendora, CA",4/11/21,2021,4,11
My supervisors are idiots and don't care enought to help us.,We have no store manager. We are understaffed. Management is cutting everyone's hours except for people in managerial or leadership positions. I'm getting paid 14.28 an hour and when I started I was getting paid 13.25. That was almost 5 years ago. Several of the team leads treat me with little care over my safety in the workplace. ,1,Current Employee,Cart Associate ,"Duarte, CA",4/11/21,2021,4,11

"Other associates are very friendly if you get along with other people, but management is terrible. They say they care, but don’t","I spent over 3 years with the Walmart company and it all went very smoothly at first for the first year or so, getting to learn about everything and trying to push forward in the company. After the required time I tried to get to move up in the company multiple times and it seems like every time they would rather hire an outside hire than promote with in. The managers always held up empty promises to get everyone to work faster and never kept the promises. Not to mention they’d act like your personal problems mattered to them when all they worried about is their personal lives and would instantly forget. And I got fired right after they were getting everything set in for my new position, since they were remodeling their job codes at the time, but they decided to cut my hours and on the next day back they told me they were letting me go for my attendance. Which I was told would have gotten fixed anyways because they docked me extra points for days while I was out on a COVID leave",1,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Lake Geneva, WI",4/11/21,2021,4,11
"Management, does not teach the employees how to do their job better or more efficiently.","I feel that it’s not how hard you work or even if you do the right thing, if your are not the supervisors friend, you are nothing. It is a bad culture, foul language is used, the dress code is off the wall, some wear what ever, but if you are not in the click, you better be in dress code. The manager promotes this behavior, because she is a part of the culture.  The said news is the customer feel it and they trash the store bad, but I always heard that the customer feel the atmosphere and join in on the process.

"Good insurance, Does not care about family life.","It's one viscous cycle.  Second shift doesn't get truck unloaded in a timely manner, because they don't want to put up freight which in turn puts the overnight shift behind and then the day shift is trying to take care of the customers, continue to put up freight plus do their job.  They won't discipline the lazy ones and over work the ones that do work.  You don't get but one weekend a month off if you are lucky and you don't get two days off in a row.  You can't get any rest!!  Defiantly not a good place to work!!!  The company has made it worse now by eliminating department managers. Most department managers took owner ship and took pride in their work and got their people to take pride in their departments too.  Now there is no accountability.

Learning at a fast pace,"When I first started at Walmart, I was placed in the pharmacy department. The pharmacy wasn't a good fit, so they placed me in with the regular associates.

Good for first job,"Cashiering is good for first job but if you can it is best to move to another area in the store as quickly as possible. Seriously, do not stay at the front end (unless you really are a people person then this might be for you).

",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Victorville, CA",4/11/21,2021,4,11
Stock ,They would not put you in one or two places to learn about stock. They would move you around every day.

They have their picks and some get to stay in one department.,4,Former Employee,Former employee  ,"Kingsport, TN",4/10/21,2021,4,10
Managers only care about themselves and their favorites,"I worked very hard for this company. I put blood, sweat and tears into my work. It never went appreciated.

Horrible place to work.,"Horrible place to work, this company really needs to work on communication with management, they really don't care about their employees, as long as it benefits them it's all good but for the employees no good. They will not work with your school schedule so if your are in college don't waste your time trying to work for them they will some what work with high school students simply because there are laws in place that they have to follow. I strongly recommend that you stay on top of Walmart policy's because management does not go by Walmart policies and will come up with their own to use employees to their advantage. Don't be scared to call and report to HR if you have any issues because they will make you feel like you can't do that.

Good pay hard work,Working in a warehouse where you throw freight onto a conveyor all day is no joke. You have to pull off inhuman numbers like some kind of robot. You will be replaced no matter what. You are able to ride it out for 6 months. But you should be looking elsewhere the whole time. The labels for the boxes that you throw on conveyor are basically stickers. But after peeling thousands for 12 hours straight will eventually make your fingers bleed. No joke.

Staff is great but patients are not,"Loved my manager and staff so great. However corporate expects to much, severely understaffed by limited hours.

Soul draining,"Do you like constant high school level drama from your coworkers and managers alike? Do you enjoy getting your hours cut to nigh nothing for no apparent reason?

Advancement and treatment not based on performance; but rather if floor management likes you or not ,Horrible place to work. No work/life balance. Company ignores your availability and makes schedule to suit their needs. Managers are rude and belligerent. Shift leads make it up as they go. No organization whatsoever.

Good Place to work,"I worked for this outside marketing Sales for a few years. I was trying to get my feet in learning about Marketing fields but quickly learned that it was not for me. I worked every day going into the office, training new sales people on the pitch, go on the field, sale the product door to door til about 6-7pm every week day. I learn on how to be confident on train and manage a team. The working conditions working outside by yourself every day in the dark at times got me in a few very uncomfortable situations.

Uncomfortable work culture and poor management,"I personally disliked my experience at Walmart. For the type of job it is, it made sense the kind of duties I was given. Not all of it was bad, but it felt extremely difficult to get to know anyone and the culture was very awkward. Some of the management really bothered me, such as people from other departments attempting to pull me away from my assigned work to do other jobs for them, even when I said I was very busy. I also was left to work on MOD team as the only member, and had to do all of the work myself. I am a pretty small person, and although I am strong, I often ended up getting hurt due to not being able to lift the shelves on my own. One of my managers also told me to just walk it off when my finger was smashed between two shelves, and was purple and bruised.I also extremely disliked HR, as I asked for accommodations for my college class schedule and they constantly made me feel bad for asking and were reluctant to give me the hours I needed.Furthermore, when I decided to quit due to not feeling like my needs were being met, I was begged multiple times to stay, and was given the option to work 5 hours a week. This was very frustrating to me, as I had attempted to advocate for myself multiple times and was not given accommodations until I was ready to quit.I think the location I was working at could do better. A more friendly work environment is the biggest thing that I wanted, which I feel like isn't very hard to provide.",3,Former Employee,OGP Associate ,"Moscow, ID",4/8/21,2021,4,8

Friendly and welcoming environment ,"I worked as a personal shopper. The work can feel repetitive, but it is rewarding. As a person who has utilized the online grocery pickup option, I understand that the work I did was essential to helping members of the community. It is hard work, you are moving on your feet for nearly your entire shift, and there can be frustrations with trying to locate product that is in the wrong spot. The employees I worked with were all very friendly and helpful. ",4,Former Employee,Personal Shopper  ,"West Jordan, UT",4/8/21,2021,4,8
Easily the most stressful job ever!,"If you work or ever have worked at Walmart, you know that going into work everyday feels like a chore! The managers have unrealistic expectations, they don’t offer help, often belittle and point out all of the negative. It can be easy to move up to lower level supervision roles, but besides that .. forget it! If they don’t like you, or if others make up complaints about you - you get nowhere. The working hours are all over the place, the pay is not enough for all the stuff you have to put up with. Customers treat you like dirt and expect “Macy’s Level Service” on a Walmart budget.

Short term 1 time only gap fill in work,"They present a ""set schedule"" but demand mandatory OT every week or be fired. Managers receive up to or maybe more of a $10,000 dollar bonus for ""your"" hard work. You get a couple hundred. Some managers talk down on you and show little to no respect. Any niceness from them and you can tell it's scripted. The atmosphere/culture is intoxicating. No rules during peak times, but then after that,  all managers have nothing to do but act like wardens. A bully system designed for disciple to give you a bad rap sheet so it looks like the associate is incapable or has a problem at work. ""FAVORITISM"" is so eye gouging it eventually wares you out. HR is absolutely no help for anything but to fire you. For medical LOA, they use a third party company that sucks and does not know how to communicate timely. Multi billion dollar company and it offers awful medical insurance and then forces you to have to use there in store vision/pharmacy to get your benefits or pay out of pocket, ""Monopolizing??""

At first everything was slow since it had just opened earlier that year, after 6 months it started to speed up as more people started ordering. When we were constantly meeting and excelling at company goals it was a fun place to work. After the start of the pandemic, it started to go down hill. Even now it’s not the same as before.

Not great,"At the beginning I loved my job but now I hate coming in. There is a lot of obvious favoritism, to the point that some associates don’t have to work. It’s so toxic, I feel like I’m back in middle school with all the drama. I used to come in early, stay late, pick up shifts etc and never got anything out of that. The managers just started expecting that from me and I would be scheduled 6 days a week but end up working every day. With Covid, I’ve had to stand outside in the middle of July for my entire 7 hour shift to be “health ambassador”, with one 15 minute break because they “forgot” my lunch and last break, and since you can’t leave your spot, I was stuck. For only $11 an hour, definitely not worth it. ",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Danville, IN",4/7/21,2021,4,7

Toxic work environment ,Management doesn’t care about you they just want the work done. The management talks to associates about other associates and their job performance usually it’s negative. They will cut your hours if you are not a fast worker and don’t give you any flexibility in your hours.

A grain of sand on a beach,"Employees don't matter. You're just a warm body that is easily lost and even easier to replace. With a company as large as Walmart, the individuals aren't noticed. Sure, you'll have meetings where lots of things are discussed, but the company is simply too big for changes to happen in a time frame where the people that lobby for the change get to see it. Also, Walmart doesn't have paid holidays. They deduct PTO from your balance on Holidays so you are, in effect, paying yourself for those holidays.

Decent workplace,Worked for 10 years and I have to say it's not a terrible place to work overal but it does have it's issues. The biggest issues for me came down to a lack of communication from management to employees and also management not providing associates with the materials needed to perform their jobs properly.

If you're short enough you have leeway with being slower but if you're not, you're just a bad worker. ",1,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Missoula, MT",4/7/21,2021,4,7
Run!, I was lied to from the get go.  Was told four 10 hour days. More like five 12 hour days and overnight shifts which was never communicated during the interview. Walmart made BILLIONS in revenue and they decide to take away things from the lower end workers. None of the people that have been there for 10+ years were pleasant to work with at all. There were a couple managers that seemed like they cared but they were really just covering their own backs. You never know your schedule. There are so many negative people there. Stay away from this place. THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS,1,Current Employee,Unloader/Receiver ,"Hurricane, UT",4/7/21,2021,4,7

Managers can be VERY cocky.,"When working, it’s almost like the managers try to scare you, if that makes sense. Each manager of course has their own personality. Some can be cool and chill, some can be rude, hateful, etc... working at Walmart store #42 in Bartlesville, Ok, the assistant store manager is very very rude. In the department I worked in, you would hardly ever see your manager. They was always sitting on their rear in the office and complained about not having things done the way the want it. The pay is okay, but it’s mentally tiring when you don’t really get acknowledged about job achievements or things that you do for the company. You can work your tail off and still never get noticed.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Bartlesville, OK",4/7/21,2021,4,7

Tiresome establishment with childish management.,"When I first started working at Walmart, things were great. Managers were understanding, respectful, and kind. At some point we got a new hospitality manager. After this, things completely changed. Late or no breaks, doing jobs I was unqualified for, and many other tasks that I should NOT had been doing. There were a few times where while I was under 18 I was placed at the liquor and cigarette lane. On top of this, I was physically unable to sell the products. I would have to call a manager over, wait about five minutes, and have them sell it. There are certain rules within Walmart that managers are supposed to follow, this includes, but is not limited to, a strict break schedule. For me working a 6 hour shift I was entitled to 1 fifteen minute paid break and 1 thirty minute unpaid lunch. Often times I would go without one or both, I reported this but nothing was done. Your experience may very well be better or worse than mine, but for me personally, I do NOT recommend working at Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Liberty, MO",4/6/21,2021,4,6
Good Option for a Chain Pharmacy,"For a chain pharmacy, they do a good job of setting up procedures to prevent mistakes and support you. Compared to what I hear from colleagues at Walgreens and CVS, they staff better too. However, it is more difficult to branch out and take advantage of state specific protocols since they like to keep things as uniform as possible and send everything through legal.As far as general experience, I have worked at good stores and ones with some irritating problems. Like with any job, who you work with is a huge part of job satisfaction. I think most of issues you might have working for Wal-Mart come from bad co-workers. When you have good managers and district managers, problem employees will be given plenty of opportunities and resources  to correct deficiencies; and in bad cases fired (other than the fact you don’t have a union representative for interactions with management, you will get similar treatment  as if you were in a union since managers will document these interactions and make sure you are aware of the potential consequences). Problems usually come when managers have not done a good job of setting and enforcing expectations.",4,Current Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,"Salem, OR",4/6/21,2021,4,6

Some days are great but the bad days are really, really bad and it feels like you just can't escape no matter what you do or how hard you try. I have worked with the company for ten years and I watched one really good store just get absolutely ran down by customers and management that don't care and then I transferred to a store that was a dump and watched some excellent management and people help turn it around into a pleasant place to be but yet the management team still gets turned upside down by market and regional and the morale is once again becoming exceptionally low.

Fire Quickly After Hiring Many People,"Laid off two new groups of people after a storm. They claimed there was not much work, but in reality, trucks were on their way after the storm was over. They laid many off even though work picked back up. They begin your interview by telling you they would rather keep their employees than let them go and to talk to them about anything. Yet, I and others were laid off after a month. Great pay, but management is not hired from within. All you need is a degree to become a manager. None of them had forklift experience or any other material handling experience. They were all textbook managers except for one.

Constantly told “I don’t have time” or “that’s not my job” from the management team that is supposed to guide us.

Soul Sucking company,"This place is not worth it. They pay the absolute minimum and cut out benefits, pay raises, or days off every year. No raises are given based on performance, even if employees deserve it. If you're terrible at your job, you get a 2% raise. If you're good at it you get a 2% raise. Management has their favorites and if you don't make the list don't expect any decency from them. Every day you'll be bombarded with work because the store is perpetually short handed and management WILL expect you to get everything done by yourself. Somehow the store can be understaffed yet they will only give people 4 hour shifts to work at the same time.Dealing with the customers is an absolute nightmare and the compensation doesn't even begin to cover it. None of the customers will treat you like an actual human being. Management fully supports ""the customer is always right."" If you don't make the customer happy they will just give them whatever they want to make them happy, even if it goes against company policy.Every day I worked there I saw at least one employee crying in the backroom because of how horrible it is to work there.

Okay place to work.,"Wal-Mart is an okay place to work. Enjoyed working with customers.  Like all retail stores, your schedule is not straightforward, but is a little more at the management level.  ",3,Former Employee,Manager ,"Indianapolis, IN",4/4/21,2021,4,4
Disappointing management. Everything is terrible here,Horrible management. You ask them to do one simple thing and next thing you know they forgot and when you bring it up they refuse to help you. They cannot communicate with eachother either. A mess to work at. No one knows what they are doing and the customers are the most disrespectful people I’ve ever encountered. They refuse to wear masks and act entitled to everything. Waste of time. Don’t work here. ,1,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Lawrence, KS",4/4/21,2021,4,4
Your a body to fill a position.,Very little communication. Roll out a new program for one department and don't explain it to the departments that has to work with you. Immediate managers have no idea what upper management requires so there is little pass down to us worker bees. Has a habit of boosting one program at the detriment of others. ,3,Current Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Beaver Dam, WI",4/4/21,2021,4,4
Recent Changes are bad for associates,"Recent change over to the ""Team"" model is generating more work to less people. Tasks are not being completed. Freight is piling up. Customer service is suffering for it. Management wants nothing but results at the expense of their associates.",2,Former Employee,Claims Supervisor ,"Ephrata, PA",4/4/21,2021,4,4
Ehh,"Management sets the bar for a company, and unfortunately, the bar has been set low at Walmart. The company as a whole used to feel more associate friendly, but now it seems like they could care less. They barely treat the hourly managers with respect. Somewhere along the years the notion that ""if you take care of your people, your people will take care of you"" has been lost. They are raising minimum wages to $13/hr (which is long overdue). ",3,Current Employee,Fresh Cap 2 Associate ,"Valdosta, GA",4/4/21,2021,4,4
Management tolerates poor work ethic and expects the hard workers to take up the slack,"Not enough equipment to perform job duties, and when employees get it, they have to give it up to the online grocery people. Management will expect you to do your job as well as the jobs of others, and even extends that to include jobs above your paygrade without compensation. Unreasonable expectations of what should be accomplished during your shift.",2,Current Employee,CAP 1 associate inventory management ,"Wichita, KS",4/4/21,2021,4,4
Lack if accountability ,Accountability is non existent.  Management is famous for writing you up to cover their own butt.  And if brought to SM attention you are treated as though you are wasting their time because remember at the end of the day you are just an associate. Which means you are nothing  and you  really don't matter,2,Current Employee,Associate  ,"Warrenton, OR",4/4/21,2021,4,4
Productive ,"It's an ok job. We usually have a meeting for the day and work on the truck and stocking. Stocking takes most of the day. Management is sometimes off, miscommunication happens at times.",3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Plainfield, IL",4/4/21,2021,4,4

Good wage but management is bad,"Don’t expect having proper training, the best is to refer to others who have been there longer than you because management never has time for answering questions, unless it’s critical. And they do not communicate unless it’s the last straw for them, and they lynch on you for a long time issue you actually had no idea about, because they won’t communicate early on. It’s a very stressful job and time consuming. If you’re ready to put your life on the side and get a good wage go for it, but you might burn out. It’s a soul crushing place and most people are miserable in there but even though people seem nice at the beginning, you will quickly learn they are gossiping all the time about everyone and they are ready to bring you down if they have the chance to do so.

Flexibility ,"Very flexible work environment, they take extra precautions to protect the people and products. There's a lot of benefits and other good things that happened to the amazing company.",4,Former Employee,Hardware Supervisor ,"Boynton Beach, FL",4/4/21,2021,4,4
good place to start at. ,"Honestly, working at Walmart sucks. They don’t treat you very well, you get paid far less than you are worth. If you apply, overshoot your expected pay because they will pay you far less than required if they can. It is difficult to move up in the workplace if they don’t want you to. I was promised when I started that I would be trained for a managerial position within the first month of working there and that never panned out. Instead they had me “shadow” roles that payed more, which was really just them using me for cheap labor. I never got the promotion I was promised and ended up leaving after transferring to a different store because they gave my PROMISED job to someone else. Company only cares about themselves and will exploit its workers. ",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Overland Park, KS",4/4/21,2021,4,4

Poor Corporate decisions lead to stressful work environment,"While I enjoyed my initial few months at my Walmart Supercenter, at some point it became completely screwed whenever Walmart decide to get rid of all of its Team Leads so that there were only 3 at most for any department throughout the entire day. For the front end, this is not enough and has lead to neglect and disgustingly poor time management due to everyone being overworked.I've learned plenty of Customer Service, and could probably give a bit of advice if asked. Coworkers are awesome and it's extremely easy to get a job there. It's an easy job, and the pay is OK whenever Walmart has its stuff together.",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Edmond, OK",4/4/21,2021,4,4

Productive and Changing workday,On a typical day you work in your section of the store. Depending on which section of the store your assigned the typical day can be simple as stocking to a entertaining endeavor of helping customers around the store. The hardest part is usually making time to accomplish some of the not so necessary task that aid the store as a whole. ,4,Former Employee,"Bryant,ArkansasBackroom InventoryAssociate ","Bryant, AR",4/4/21,2021,4,4

Good place to work for a job in college,I worked at Walmart for a summer and I really enjoyed it. I hadn't heard great things but I really liked the job. All of my coworkers were super nice and hard working and I always had something to do. I felt like my shifts went by super quick which is always good. The biggest issue I had is I got hired as temporary part time help to deal with increased business with the pandemic and they started me at 40 hours right off the bat. I was still in school for the semester and I said that. I feel like its exploiting labor to hire someone as temporary part time and then give them 40 hours but not pay them as full time. I eventually got this issue resolved it was just initially annoying because I had school and was hired as part time. ,4,Former Employee,Garden Center Associate ,"Atlanta, GA",4/3/21,2021,4,3
Decent if your working part time,Company policies seem to stretch workforce thin and create more work. Rather than hire another person to have full coverage of an area they would rather pull people from other departments creating a cycle that means someone doesn't get something done in their department. Management is hard to find in store and sometimes do not respond when needing help. People leads and higher management are bad about scheduling and even schedule outside of original availability because they need people from other departments to cover their areas.,1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Crowley, TX",4/3/21,2021,4,3

Advancement is hard though even if you work hard and try to learn everything you can.,4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Spearfish, SD",4/3/21,2021,4,3
backstabbing people,Working as a salaried member of management was the worst decision I could have made. Love working for this company as an hourly but as a manager I had absolutely no home life. 16hr days 6 days a week still wasn't good enough for the store manager. Managers don't care about employees health or safety but corporate does yet they will never back you up. Don't go into management with this company if you value your home life.,1,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Las Vegas, NV",4/3/21,2021,4,3

This is NOT that place. ,"This company is all show. They say they care about people, but that’s only some people. They allow leadership to conduct themselves with arrogance, intimidation, and major favoritism. I had a great run of 18 years due to the awesome people I worked with. There was a time I really enjoyed working there, but things shifted, and my leadership team above me was horrible. The open door policy is a joke. They sweep more under the rug than you would think. There was a time when I bragged on the company to everyone, about how important integrity was to the company, but that wore off quickly as soon as I brought issues to the surface. They really don’t want to know what’s wrong, because they have to work harder to sweep things under the rug. I will say, there was a time when there were more great supervisors than bad, but that table is turning quickly. Using the open door is a shot in the dark. Sometimes it will be handled, and sometimes it won’t.  Consistency does not exist. Still a major good ole boy club that has resurfaced after is was cleaned up prior to today.

However once I transferred to another store (Berea, KY) it ended up being a dead end job and after over five years put in I only stayed there another year once I transferred.

hit and miss with this company,overall this company can be a curse or a blessing.  It really depends on what store you work at and the people that you have to work with.  I was lucky enough to work with some that really became family and made the job a little less stressful at times. This company is always changing and the stress falls on management which trickles to its associates.  Associates are afraid to speak up for fear of retaliation. When reported management just ignores it as they are overwhelmed and don't want to deal with it.  The best part of the job is meeting new people and learning new things when given the opportunity.  The training requires modules that are done via a computer as well as some training on the sales floor. The worst part is the high stress level incurred by this job.  ,3,Former Employee,Department Manager/Sales Associate ,"Round Rock, TX",4/2/21,2021,4,2

Walmart overall seem to be a good place to work unless there were personal situations between ever-changing management personnel and work theories on myself to most of my 24 years of Walmart experience everything was well and accommodating my medical situations.

I was working 20 hours, I’m part time now, but I dropped to 7-13 hours. I asked manager about being crossed trained in the front to get more hours and I got snapped on for asking. I mean if y’all are going to cut my hours, why can’t I get cross trained? I worked at a different Walmart prior and besides inventory and pharmacy I was cross trained in every position.

Walmart does not care about retaining good employees,"Walmart is happy to throw you away and hire someone who won't work half as hard. The culture is that employees are cheap tools to be thrown away and replaced whenever. Meanwhile customers are allowed and sometimes encouraged to steal which in turn prevents us from getting bonuses no matter how much the store sells because the shrink is so high.Walmart culture is also to ONLY hire managers who think they are God's gift to the world and look down on everyone else. Maybe.. MAYBE 1% of Walmart management (including assistant managers and team leads) is actually qualified for the job. They pushed out a great manager at our store and gave us a corrupt, useless failure of a replacement who may be on the way out as well. There is no longer much room for career advancement. They got rid of CSMs and department heads and other positions and replaced them with extremely overworked team leads. Team leads immediately became overstressed and quick to bite your head off.YOU WILL NEVER EVER HAVE ACCESS TO THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO DO THE JOB!

Massive favoritism and non existent management,"I worked there for 13 years all together. The beginning was great but as the years went on it severely went downhill. When I transferred to the deli it was rampant with favoritism and people throwing others under the bus. It was like high school all over again with everyone having their cliques. The most ruthless cliques were the ones that management treated the best, out of fear or I don't know what. They would rather promote a yes man than someone that would actually do their job. Their was barely a management team. They always hid away anywhere they had to do actual work. If you needed help there was no one to be found whether it was a customer or employee. It was everyone for themselves. And they would lie to you to either get what they want or to get you out of their hair. Their was no good part of the management team that I can remember.Even after that most of the employees that had some decency were still good.

The work environment is completely working together as a team and you will always get help to solve a problem you may not know the answer to yet. It can get busy to where you may feel overwhelmed but 9 times out of 10 everyone is being helped and you're just getting caught up in the sense of urgency. I enjoy all the different personalities in the pharmacy, it makes for some funny stories and interesting topics.

Bad,Worked as a manager for company for 10 years. Most times i felt like i was just a face in the crowd and constantly wondered when my job would be eliminated. Superficial recognition given for great work. Work enviorment  Depends on higher up managment attitude but unfortunately higher up management not always in position because of merit.,2,Former Employee,Asset Protection Assistant Store Manager ,"Leesburg, VA",3/30/21,2021,3,30

"Go to work, do your job, go home",The only good thing I can say about working at a Walmart is that you learn how to handle a lot of different situations pertaining to customers and coworkers. It builds character that can be extremely helpful at a different company. Management only cared about themselves and how they can benefit from making your life h*ll. Store manager did not acknowledge any of his employees; blatantly ignore them as though they do not exist. Older employees felt entitled and receive special treatment. ,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Charleston, IL",3/30/21,2021,3,30

It was a job ,"Like anything you will come to like some things about the experience but at the day it’s just work. In a typical work day you would login to the handheld device, look for the order, wheel it out and arrange it in the customers car. We were told not to accept tips even when the customer’s with two families worth of grocer offer it, we were also told to discourage the customers from helping us load the car unless they really press us about arrangement and placement. When productivity is low because the day is slow and there aren’t enough customers expect to be given different responsibilities you aren’t trained for, workers will often be told to help other departments if one is more busy than the other.Employees get a fifteen minute brake for every hour they work, and for every four hours of work employees get a thirty minute lunch brake. There is a brake room towards the back of the building that employees can go to and spend time in during their brakes.Individuals who worked there longer, have more responsibilities or are in a bigger work position, often take the workday and the general job more seriously than the people who see the work as a temporary situation. This is universal in all Walmart establishments.The hardest part of the actual job is the physicality aspect (i,e. carrying, lifting, pushing). Objectively speaking the social aspect of working for Walmart is also draining and is some days difficult. For example a rude customer could come in and yell at everyone to only discover that they went to the wrong Walmart to pick up their order but you’re the one that - more...",2,Former Employee,Walmart OGP ,"Frederick, MD",3/30/21,2021,3,30
No family time at all ,I worked for Walmart for 20 years and retired from company. It was the most stressful job I have ever had. If you have a family and like seeing them this is not the job for you,1,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Thomasville, GA",3/30/21,2021,3,30
Co workers/associates ,"This company is shady, its good for a first job to get your feet wet with work. If you thinking long term better be single and don't have a family life because they will promise you a schedule and you will set your life around it. They will say we care about you and the schedule will be set so you can work and have a life. Then couple months its forget your availability this is your days and hrs we have if you take it you will have full time if not you're part time get 3 days this week and next week no hours. So how do the care about you. Most times if you work hard you get more work given to you. Get your hrs cut so the store manager can make his bonus. It's just a snake pit on top of crabs in a barrel. The best part in walmart is the regular associates you will meet and work with. Cap1 and cap2 sucks it's bad. And now the even monitor the food they give on thanks giving. when you get a free meal they tell associates they can't have a lot or seconds we will take out your food for you.  But before the last 2 yrs you could serve yourself what you wanted like if you was home. Walmart isn't a great or even a good place to work its some where to be to help pay bills. 😒 Seen so many associates cry at this place its rough work place.

The good was that you had PTO time.,"Walmart only care about the money, being made instead of the people working to make the money for the company. God forbid if you are sick.

Poor Work Culture Environment ,"Managers often treated staff like children. Very disrespectful, condescending. Would use lying about working on holidays as their only method to motivate people to meet goals. No positive feedback. Never felt appreciated while working here. 90% of people working were miserable. Hours fluctuate, and there is no real schedule. It’s listed as a full time position, but there were weeks where we only worked 15-25 hours. Could find out last minute that you are working on the weekend. You could get to work, and only work for two hours or work until 4:30 (and they still won’t tell you how late you could be working). When first hired, I was told I would be working until 3, and would have plenty of notice so I could make arrangements for someone to pick up my kids from school.

Grateful to work here full-time during pandemic,"Walmart does not treat its employees well in regards to scheduling and ensuring enough hours. They will give you a bonus, then the following week cut your hours. The management has no clue what they’re doing. But if you’re diligent and assertive, you will get what you want. I had to fight for my rights a lot but managed to get everything I want, which is guaranteed 40 hours per week and full-time status and the schedule that I want. I also just got a generous pay raise and am making comfortable money. I enjoy what I do and like the nature of my job as an online grocery picker. I like most of my colleagues and enjoy going to work. I get along with management, but they are not very sophisticated—contrary to what you would expect from a corporate management team.

Flexible Schedule was a huge plus,"WM isn't a horrible place to work. Typical day was cashiering and doing returns. Doing returns was my favorite part of the job and cashiering (my actual job) was the worst. People suck. Which of course wasn't WM's fault, and they did tell me on more than one occasion that I could transfer whenever I wanted. So there's definitely room to grow. A ""con"" for this position is that the pay is non-negotiable when coming on. I was a cashier for 2 years prior to coming into WM and they did not take that into consideration. Pay was less than minimum wage I want to say. I am a single mom with a FT job and WM was very accommodating when it came to my schedule. Which is exactly why I stayed as long as I did.

While I do not have a team of associates, they help me accomplish what I can throughout the day.

You’ll get more vacation at 3 but at 5, the store will have a certain standard for you to where you will be treated differently than those who have only been there 6 months to a year. Because you will have worked with the same coworkers and managers for 5 years you’ll get a say so in what you do or don’t want to do. But coming into Walmart and only being a year in, if I have an issue with something it’ll only make things worse as far as how I feel about it. A lot of store managers are young that I’ve seen and they always seem to be in on the drama if they’re young or older and have worked for the store a while. If you’re looked at as “different,” for whatever reason a group will talk about you and it may Include managers. They all have phone numbers group messages and add each other on socials. And to be a company based on ethics but just about all of them are unethical. ",1,Former Employee,"Frozen, Dairy Stocker, MRA ","Conway, AR",3/28/21,2021,3,28

"Great first job, until you want a little more","I worked photo lab before it's extinction and I loved it, but this was unlike the rest of Walmart we had our own little unit our own little staff are a little mission beyond what Walmart's main mission was. And it was great having interesting people always around but of course you meet enough people and you'll meet one that will cross you. I was an interim manager had even gone to a manager's meeting with the temporary manager. shortly after I went in on my day off to grab some pictures I developed, but the lab was slammed and I didn't want to interrupt waiting customers. As I went to go and price it which I would have obviously had an employee check, but I was unaware taking two minutes to sign on a price telxon and print a price tag was a violation of labor laws. I guess it's in egregious horrible awful thing for me to have spent 2 minutes in that lab and not gotten paid 4 cents I would earned. But beyond that was the most meanest thing I've ever experienced and this is not Walmart's photo, this is what Walmart creates inadvertently, competition. When the connection Center opened in cell phones were beginning to be sold a woman I worked with very closely decided to take advantage of a situation. See when I went and printed my price tag I did in a very joking way which everyone in my lab already knew something to just get the attention of everyone who might know where the printer is. With 25% of Max foresight slammed down on a counter and with a very country like accent said ""where's my printer at"".... That's all.Couple days later I got called into the office and fired, - more...",2,Former Employee,Interim Photo Manager ,1018 Riley Street Folsom Photo Lab,3/28/21,2021,3,28

Review from a manager,"I was a manager for 12 years. The first 10 years I was able to move up in the company and feel like i actually made a difference and my effort was noticed. The last two years walmart steadily changed into a cesspool.  The market managers and above kept placing more and more pressure in an attempt to reduce costs. Everything is metric driven and unfortunately the job of a manager was changed from running a profitable, customer friendly store to just make sure that the store doesnt show up red on a scorecard.The company as it was when i left was making great sales and raking in profit but as a manager i was putting unseemly amounts of hours in at work in order to appear to be green on a scorecard.While working for Walmart I was able to buy two homes, marry, and have a family. The only issue was that I was rarely able to spend time with them.If you are single and want a chance to make money at a job that requires no college degree then walmart can be that place but be prepared to work your behind off.",3,Former Employee,Co Manager ,"Naples, FL",3/27/21,2021,3,27
Really depends on who your manager is,My manager played games with everyone’s schedules and it was very much like mean the girls movie. I felt like everything I did wasn’t good enough and the managers favorite got dibs on whatever they wanted. I genuinely hated working there. I resigned and left in one day. It was heart breaking but they began to make me believe I had high levels of anxiety and that I wasn’t a good employee. That I should be lucky to work there since I was so bad at the job. When I spoke to other people I had worked with. They said a total opposite. I was being gaslit at every corner. My manager got mad that I got engaged! Really was teed off for weeks afterwards.,3,Former Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Port Saint Lucie, FL 34953",3/27/21,2021,3,27
My experience wasn’t the best mainly because the management was heavy on rules one day and bugging you about them the next. ,It’s a great way to earn some money but personally Its nothing that I would make a career out of. After a while you are doing the same thing over and over again. The days get repetitive and I like to do different things every once in a while.

Fuel up your machine because its battery doesn't hold a charge in the freezer for more than 4 trips? Counted against you.Breaks are 15 minutes and 25 minutes to avoid clocking out which is cool...except that your break starts as soon as you call off your last package, so the 6 minutes to get to the break room is counted as PART OF YOUR BREAK.

If you struggle to keep a job because you have an attitude problem and are disinterested in working apply here.

One time being in trouble by leaving some spots dirty, taking photos behind my back, and not telling me about it when I had plenty of time to go back and fix it, but no he had to tell me about it in the office. But I do have other parts of management that are nice, just relieved when the bad ones don't show up! To be honest the hardest part of this job is getting up and driving there and it's not too far away as it's about a 20-minute drive.

The people. ,The people I worked with are outstanding.  Very good people.  It is sad though that if you don't fit into the WM culture you are treated as an outcast by management and things will not go well for you.,2,Former Employee,Merchandise Assistant ,Puerto Rico,3/25/21,2021,3,25
Sucked,They didn't have enough equipment and we were always understaffed. It's gotten increasingly difficult to move up in the company. Management actively did not care about the life work balance of their associates. ,2,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Jackson, MO",3/25/21,2021,3,25
The Meat Grinder,"Because walmart is such a huge company, their corporate structure don't allow them to have any sympathy for individual employees.

Terrible ,"One of the worst jobs I worked at. Felt constantly stressed out to the point that my mental health deteriorated. Management is terrible and nobody knows what to do. Would strongly advise not working here if you are a parent, student, or anyone that has a life outside of this job due to the constant need of mandatory overtime.

I started during the height of the pandemic so it did get very overwhelming at times. the turnover rate was ridiculous. i met some nice coworkers though.,3,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Charlotte, NC",3/25/21,2021,3,25
So-so,"I worked there for some time, the pay was decent for someone that is a student as well. Management can be very hard headed and don't listen to most suggestions or reasoning. At times they have unreal expectations of people, in my opinion if they need so much done they should hire more people but they don't. Also customers can be very very rude for no reason so having tough skin is a must. I enjoyed my coworkers and job at the time but it wasn't somewhere I enjoyed going back to everyday.",3,Former Employee,Worker ,"Dinuba, CA",3/25/21,2021,3,25

Deceptive,"Lots of changes in management shortly after I started, some positions just evaporated, incl. Mine. New positions were given to people based on who u knew and for how long. They Changed job position, changed shifts hours and department I was hired 4. Nothing is what it was supposed to be. Management higher up needs to have realistic goals set. The store looks like a chaotic mess which matches the management. Its sad because there is a ton of very good hard working people there and they r not treated very good, spoken down to, very condescending. And overloaded w unreasonable workload. Need more employees 3rd shift to work freight and zone properly. Click-ish high up in mgmt. Needs new mgmt and needs to follow thru on their commitments they make when hiring people!",2,Current Employee,Wouldnt make a difference ,"Bloomsburg, PA",3/25/21,2021,3,25

Terrible,"Oh boy. Well, I was really looking forward to working here before I got the job. A few months in I absolutely hated it, but I was also on CAP2 which the unloading freight/stocking frieght. It was a very hard and strenuous job (which I actually didn't mind until I got pregnant with my first child about 7 months from starting working here). My main problem with this company is the management. Way too many managers yanking you left and right. One manager says one thing while another says something different. I then moved to electronics a few months after having my baby and I loved it, all up until my management starting sucking and nitpicking every little thing. Changing rules left and right. The management in this company also doesn't do things to code or the ""one best way"". In short, I have grown to despise and hate this company. It treats its hardest most loyal associates terribly. Ask anyone works there and im sure they will tell you they dont like it. When I come into work everyday you can just see it in peoples faces. Over expectations from the managers and unrealistic tasks to complete for just one person. ",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Wilmington, NC",3/25/21,2021,3,25

Stressful and Consuming ,"Over the course of the last year, with a decline in applicant and good workers, the pharmacy has lost most of the full time people that keep everything together. We are down to so few people that the days I do work, I am asked to come in early and stay late. I am working 13+ hours and the next time I come back it is just as bad or even worse-- so my work doesn't feel like it is really doing anything. It is a high stress environment and with a lack of quality coworkers that actually do their job and try to make the days go smooth and better, this job drains the life of out me. My favorite part of this job used to be the people I worked with, we worked as a team and we wanted to help the customers that came to us but now it is just a paycheck that is definitely deserved from all the hours and stressful situations that I have to endure. No one wants to feel like you are just working for the paycheck, you want to be happy in your role and feel like you are making a difference and I just do not feel that.

"Great coworkers, Very busy environment ","I have worked in customer service for over 30 years, and worked at Walmart for a little over a year. The people there are nice, most work well together, and I actually liked it. Management didn’t always have the best ideas, but that’s the way management is in most places.   The hardest part of this job is working with customers. I actually love people and customer service. But honestly, since the pandemic, it’s gotten harder. People are much harder to work with. They are angry all the time. You can’t take it personally.   I liked to be busy, and as a cashier, I worked a lot on the self-checkout area. I would clean the checkouts, straighten up and help customers. I also would work on a separate checkout. I would also work at the door, greeting customers.

Good college job,"Walmart is a good company to work for as a starting point. It is great for a first job or as part time when going to school. It is not livable wage and there are not opportunities for growth within the company especially since at the lowest level of the organization, the store, many have managers who got up to the management level unethically and have no clue how to be a manager. This is especially evident since 3 weeks at ""Walmart Academy"" to be an ASM is all that is needed to suddenly turn someone into a manager. Additionally, the organization keeps revamping and is finally increasing wages for all workers however you'll just be stuck in place. Don't fool yourself. The company still sucks and has okay benefits.

Very overwhelming workload,"300 Employees to 1 HR representative no management support and no authority to get things accomplished.

All recruiting, selecting, onboarding and follow-up training is on the people lead. way to much for 1 person without changing store culture first.

They never actually know the time it takes to finish your tasks at all and expect you to do the impossible and unless you're a part of management, front end, or online shopper don't be surprised if you work by yourself sometimes when it's meant to be a while team assignment. Front end and online shoppers are always seen in an high light and will always be priority over you and they don't do anything to help other departments unless forced to. Also be prepared to deal with the morning crews trash because they don't know how to pick up after themselves and will never try to help out afternoon crew no matter what department you're in.

DDI and Walmart Spark platform,"I feel that both entities know exactly what happens to a driver that has been deactivated from the platform, but gives no justifiable reasons or information that helps a driver understand what they might've done wrong and or be given a chance to defend themselves during an appeal. The both parties do not care about the drivers as there will be another one soon after to take their place. Most Spark representatives are not on the same page as being knowledgeable when it comes to driver's issues and it can be quite frustrating. The app in a whole has many issues that should've been corrected before launching this platform during a pandemic, so a year later, there is no point in looking back at past errors and pointing fingers, but to just move forward and improve on the areas that need it so that it can help current and future drivers. Keep in mind that a driver aka Independent contractor gets frustrated at times from all areas Ie. Walmart dispense team if running late or giving wrong/missing items, the Sparks reps for not knowing their job duties, but expect a rating of a 5 and then of course there are those few customers that can make your delivery rough by not having clear directions and or instructions as well as updated contact info. Then there are those drivers that basically are new to the platform and make a ton of mistakes making it look bad for the rest of us trying to stand out from the rest. In a nutshell, ask questions if you are not certain, be nice to the Walmart associates (because they can reject you from a delivery), be conscientious to the customer's needs - more...",3,Former Employee,Independent Contractor/Driver ,"Mesa, AZ",3/23/21,2021,3,23

Then sticking with the company as a picker, receiver, stower, trainer (and sometimes sort of a lead) until about 2017 I saw all of the company going in a decline. I used to joke that for every bad worker we lost about four good workers (due to the turnover rate.) When I came back in October 2020, pretty much the joke I stated was still in relevancy. I only saw about four people still in the company that were not upper management. The dock belt that I was stationed in was the same we used six years ago. The leads and lower management are under constant stress and mentioned or put more stress on us the dock when the work was nearly impossible to get done. From about October 2020 to March 18th I worked the hardest that I ever did in my life and got fired for something pretty much everyone does, they were looking for an excuse to fire me along with four other good people on the dock.

"Good job, Poor Management & Support","I work as a personal shopper, and I actually enjoy core of the job a lot. However, poor management and minimum praise/support for hard work has lead to a lack of motivation within our department and general sloppiness. It has made the job harder than it needs to be which overall brings down the quality of the experience. They seem to care more about attendance points than work ethic, which means good workers from the team are fired and those who show up and do the bare minimum are kept around. There are good benefits, and the pay is more than suitable for the job.

Either way, it was a decent retail job, and they respected that I was dealing with a long-term injury on the job.  The pay was okay - not great, but average for retail in my area.  The problem that caused me to look for a new job was a HUGE cut in hours after the holiday season.

You can put in paid time off , they accept it, and you could still get a point. You get a lunch and two breaks, but the team leads choose when you go.

Not a long term job,"Walmart has been a staple to many customers lives. It is a great store with lots of potential in an online world where brick and mortar are slowly fading away. The backbones of the company, the employees. Is what keeps Walmart, Walmart. And I am one of them. I feel as though this company is picky. They are very choosey in how they hire you, what hours you work, and what they feel they have the right to do behind closed doors. As being hired on as a TLE Service Writer associate, for the second time in a 6 month time frame, to say the least, Walmart sucks at management. I have had many issues with HR, my department manager(s), and so forth. I feel as though since this company isn't per say a factory or a physical labor job, associates and managers slack in the following areas: respect, accountability, communication, and most importantly, making new associates feel welcomed and taken care of. I have had issues since being interviewed. The company simply needs to get their stuff together, the outside world will not want to work for a company who can't provide the necessary items for a happy, hardworking individual who wants to move up in life.

The retention rate for new hires at these warehouses is incredibly low; don't be surprised if multiple co-workers quit sooner than you.,3,Former Employee,Warehouse Worker ,"Bentonville, AR",3/15/21,2021,3,15
Decent for short term  ,"The overall work feels VERY soul draining, at least as a cashier. The whole front end is very understaffed, so we end up having to spread 7 or so people out through registers and self checkouts, even on our busiest days, leading to what feels like a never ending line of customers that treat you like trash. Working on the sales floor isn't much better, as often times managers will pull people from a department to go work somewhere else, even if their primary department is busy or has a lot of items to stock. Managers will give you large tasks and expect you to get it done, but don't give you enough people to actually do it. Speaking of management, they never seem to do anything. A lot of times when you need them they'll be near impossible to find, and when you do find them they'll be reluctant to do whatever you needed them for. They seem to not care about changing employee's schedules, leading to you having to constantly remind them to change it. Overall they seem really disorganized and sometimes even lazy. They never even had anyone properly train me for either of my positions, I had to learn on the fly or from other coworkers, a lot of which have experienced the same issue. The pay is pretty good, especially if you're a minor. And while it can be frustrating to change availability, they do offer decently flexible schedules, at least for students. 30 min - 1 hour lunches along with 1 or 2 breaks (both depending on how many hours you work that day) are also very nice.

Clicks and favoritism,"A small town with Small Town ideas and mentality. Fraternizing with coworkers is not encouraged, and the middle management controls the mood and energy.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager/Cashier ,"Camden, TN",3/15/21,2021,3,15
N/a,The work environment is highly stressful. It's like a  free for all went it comes to working in this death trap. There is no form of communication with the management team to make any improvements for the company. There is no team work what so ever when it comes to taking on the heavy loads for a job task. The hardest part of the job is meeting deadlines and the enjoyable part of the job is earning a decent paycheck.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Schenectady, NY",3/15/21,2021,3,15
Trust,Trust is an issue. Associates do not trust management to have their backs when things are tough. We can't even get the hours we were hired for. And there is no longer a quarterly bonus.  (in my store it averaged around 200 each quarter),2,Current Employee,Maintenance overnight ,Graham TX,3/15/21,2021,3,15

Co-workers were great. Managers were snobs.,"Management ALWAYS thought they were better than hourly waged employees. They would yell at cashiers for talking  to each other during slow times, but were ALWAYS standing around talking with other Managers themselves.  NO TEAM DRIVE HERE. MANAGEMENT treats lower level employees  like dirt. ",3,Former Employee,casher / clerk ,"De Pere, WI",3/15/21,2021,3,15
