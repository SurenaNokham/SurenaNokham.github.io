Excellent Corporate Culture,I have been employed by Walmart 12 years and I find it to be a great place to work .

Stressed,"Walmart, as a place to work has gone significantly down hill in the last few years. Hours that used to be flexible and plentiful are now random and hard to come by. One is given the choice between either getting enough hours or working the hours you want/need, never both, often neither. Support wise, I often find my self working with what feels like a skeleton crew. Task that were once easy, are now stressful due to lack of coverage. Management constantly seem more interested in keeping their own superiors happy then helping those below them succeed. Even if they do help, they can't do much because of how inflexible the company policies are nowadays. Creativity, once encouraged, is now highly frowned upon. Ideas that do not work are constantly thrust upon us because someone up the command chain thinks its a good idea without getting feedback first._x000D_To there credit, the pay is good for big box retail and hard safe work is encouraged if only halfheartedly.

Work at wal mart as a last resort,i worked for walmart for a year in that year i was a new mom going to college i told them i could only do 20 hours a week and they consistently scheduled me for 35 to 40 but refused to make me full time when i asked. i was routinely asked to clock out for a lunch (before my six hour mark of being on the clock) to only stay on the sales floor and work through my lunch. i was always told i would get my lunch later but hardly ever did and only when my direct manager was there not when the gm was there. i was given no training on products that  the customers were asking about and what little training i got was for taking out the trash or waste management that was not in my job description. the only thing i enjoyed about the job were my coworkers they were amazing people to work with but still not enough to make me stay for minimum wage without benefits.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Carson City, NV",2/22/19,2019,2,22
An OK job for a little while.,For most people working at Walmart they didn't encounter the issues I had with them. I was pretty much the youngest person working in my position at 18 so they used me in a lot more ways than everyone else. I got hired for the CAP 1 position which is where you basically stock the regular dry foods such as canned foods and chips and mac and cheese. My issue was that I was seen as an opportunity for Walmart to completely get rid of the position of overnight stocking of the frozen foods which were paid about $14 an hour for the job yet I was only making $11. They pretty much put me by myself every day only stocking frozen foods directly in the middle of the day which was definitely not what I applied for nor got hired for so I was pretty confused at first. They had told me that they would be switching everyone around from day to day throughout all of the cap 1 associates which clearly they did not do except for maybe once or twice. So I got hired for one job then got placed in a completely different job being underpaid for that job for about 5 months. Then I decided enough was enough and couldn't do the job anymore if they couldn't pay me properly for the position or let me do my actual job.,3,Former Employee,Cap 1 Associate ,"Thornton, CO",2/22/19,2019,2,22

Unethical and incompetent management,"Being a cashier was very enjoyable and the responsibilities were fair. However, associates were never informed of policy changes after they started employment.

Working at walmart,"I worked in Cap 2 which means I was an unloader.

They barely page maintenance to sweep the store I see cashier's sweep the store and some get sent outside to push in carts when they don't have a cart pusher. I see cashier's having to do others jobs when others can't do it. It seems very unfair for cashier's and customer service managers!

Worst job EVER,"Do not waste your time applying here! Everyday is more aggravating than the other. Management is awful! They are unwilling to take responsibility for anything. They pass on the hot potato and are plain unbelievable! They do nothing all they long. They are always no where to be seen. The customers are unbelievably ignorant! They are your typical low income, dirty and untitled bunch. I hate coming to work! The hours drag and you face dumb stuff  from the moment you walk in. They require you to do your job plus the job of two or three other people. The employees, the great majority are clueless! I get home exhausted everyday and I will lose it one of these days.

Rewarding and Enjoyable For Customers but Not For The Associate.,"A typical day at Walmart can vary. Some days are fast paced and stressful, while it can also be slow and relaxed. I learned how to effectively communicate with my coworkers by working together to help customers and complete tasks. I also learned how to successfully communicate  with customers to help them with their needs and problems. The most rewarding thing is having a customer leave with a smile. Management has always been complicated to me. There are some managers who push me to do my best and be successful, while some just simply are far too intimidating to approach with questions. The working culture is amazing. Many of my coworkers and I get along fantastic and always focus on teamwork. The hardest part of the job would be trying to simply stay calm on an off day. It is normal for both the customer and I to have a bad day, and sometimes that can truly show when communicating with them. And too look past those moments could always be difficult. However, the most enjoyable and rewarding is helping a customer successfully. May it be helping them find a product or recommending a product. Even if I do not have the ability to successfully help them my main goal is to always have them walking away with a smile and a positive attitude. That is the most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job.",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Manahawkin, NJ",2/21/19,2019,2,21

Good pay and benefits but overall awful place to work,I loved my job. Only problem was i never got to do it. I was all over the store and i got told i HAD to do manager work without the pay. Everyone there loves drama and most of the managers will not do anything to help you despite giving you a job you could not possibly finish in the time frame they have given you. Hour vary as well. One week you get about 39 hours (they won't give you 40 because they don't want you to be full time) then the next few weeks you only get 19 hours.,2,Former Employee,ASSOCIATE ,"Altavista, VA",2/20/19,2019,2,20

"Not good lunch, break and attendance policies","They don't have good management, break, and attendance policies._x000D__x000D_They should have kept the last attendance policy and use one of these lunch and break policies:_x000D__x000D_PTO Flexible paid Break Time Plan:_x000D_Hi, this has been a concern for me for quite a while and now I want to talk about it. To allow associates to eat healthier that way they don't get diabetes and high cholesterol, keep their energy levels up to work faster, and feel happier about being awake at work. For them also to be safer at work that way they aren't too tired pulling pallets for heavy trucks when about to pass out, because they are about to fall asleep and have pallets run over them and hit them. Or even just pass out by falling asleep when working and having many other problems.  I think that we should do a PTO Flexible Paid Break Time Plan.  Here's how the plan works: Allow associates to start as early as two hours before their shift and end within two hours after their shift and allow that much time for them to show up to not get a tarty which is a half absence.  To make things fair like as they were before have every associate for every two hours worked earn 15 minutes of PTO Flexible Paid Break Time when earning a choice of up to five minutes to two-hour breaks for however long they choose for averaging a break every two hours worked. Or we can keep the whole work policy the same as it is now, and just adding all your unpaid break time to your lunch hour without managers complaining about your breaks when especially they are unpaid allowing associates to show up two hours before the shift and end before - more...",1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Fort Gratiot Township, MI",2/20/19,2019,2,20
Very busy work places with minimum staffing.,"Most pharmacists at least the old timers are salaried so the 80 hour pay period is usually closer to 90+ hours per pay period. The customer is always right - which on some retail levels is understandable, but not on the medical side. Management does NOT stand behind their pharmacists, they have lots of zero tolerance policies that while look good on paper, should be based more on the actual happenings and reasons why issues have occurred. There is not as much camaraderie as you would expect for working in such a small space with the same people. With all the policies and regulations, as well as, lack of management support it is very hard to get to know your patients very well. Large chains like Wal-Mart are more worried about bottom lines and numbers than they are for their employees and sometimes even customers in some cases. It shouldn't be that way, and would not be that hard or bad for management to side with the pharmacist at times or at least have their backs sometimes.",3,Former Employee,Pharmacist ,"All of Oklahoma, OK",2/20/19,2019,2,20

Need more appreciation,"Working at Wal-Mart was great when I started working there, but over the years, the job experience was not great. Typically my day working their was working as a cashier. After my two years anniversary, management moved me around the store to stock and zone departments, be the overhead operator for phone or department calls, and be Secondary at the Customer Service desk. Before the last year I left Wal-Mart, I was working at the Vision Center as an Optician. I was helping customers choosing glasses or contacts for their vision prescriptions. I left their because lack of training from the other associates and manager. I went to back to cashier. I left of Wal-Mart because of management because they never appreciate their employees.

Good pay,Wal-Mart is a good paying job. But you work alot it's hard to find a family life. They are not very understanding with you home life. They would decline my requests for days off.

Assistant Manager,"I can tell you as someone who has been a retail worker, then a retail manager, the “typical” retail day is going to be spent inventorying, setting up end caps, cleaning up displays, ringing up sales on a typical cash register, and cleaning.

The poeple you work with are extended family,"Every day you may have a different task. You learn that sometimes customers have bad days as well and you need to take care of their need without judgment. One downfall of management is telling someone else what is needed of you. Sometimes these are rude and have no people skills. They need to learn that a job gets done faster and with ease when a person is asked to do it with a kind voice instead of rudely obnoxious voice. We most generally work together as a team with diverse culture and races as being family ordinated. The hardest part of the job would be when a customer talks to you and complains like it is your fault, maybe even cursing at you. It is enjoyable to see the same customers who come by to see you and talk to you like family. they know you treat them well and come back for your help.",3,Current Employee,JEWELRY CORDINATOR ,"Checotah, OK",2/18/19,2019,2,18

I honestly wouldn’t recommend working for this company.,"My review on working for Walmart would be that it definitely taught me to become even more resourceful due to the lack of accommodations for various employees and their personal situations. I understand that there is an establishment of business to be managed and maintained; at the same token, the employees are being force fed hyperboles of job security, a family oriented work environment and, compensation for the unexpectancies of life, especially for those with children such as myself, amongst other discrepancies. I’m gracious for the experience and knowledge I’ve gained while being employed by this company. I’m currently in a pivotal position in life where I need to take a drastic step to ensure the financial security of my family and I. I believe that I will better myself and to do so I must exit my “comfort zone” to expand my horizons and attempt more challenging tasks as opposed to food industry, stocking, or customer service type occupations.",1,Current Employee,Modular Team Associate/ Stocker ,"Winston-Salem, NC",2/18/19,2019,2,18
You work with some really great people.,"When I started this job I was painfully shy but interacting with customers all day helped me open up and find my personality. A typical day at my job starts with cleaning because I like to start with a clean station. I help customers all day which is great. I learned so many things here. I was trained on Self Checkout, Customer Service and Cashier plus I also helped wherever I was needed. Management here was pretty good. I actually miss my old store. I had a bunch of really nice co-workers that I worked with over the 3 years. The hardest part of the job is taking all the CBLs because there are quite a few(the CBLs themselves aren't hard just sitting in front of the computer is) but other than that it isn't too bad. My favorite part of the job is seeing customers smile after I helped them successfully get checked out and got all their bags in their cart.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Covington, VA",2/18/19,2019,2,18
The whole store is a Mad house starting with management!,"I worked in the Online Grocery/ Ecommerce departmment, there you are overworked and stressed out to the max. Lots of orders with a handful of people to pick them and it's hard on the 1 or 2 dispensers (No teamwork). Wal-Mart never has enough people and always short staffed (in every department) because they fire people faster than they can hire them, most of HR is vertically challenged and catches an attitude when you need help. Overtime would be so easy to come by but they tell [not ask] you to kill it by taking a longer lunch.

The management could use a little more work. They weren't that organized, but they always pulled through. The culture of Walmart was great. No one mistreated another employee, everyone got along. The hardest part of the job was how at times when you aren't working a day, the next day you come back something has changed. So it gets difficult to figure out where something is.

A typical day at work for me is being spied on by fellow older associates for no apparent reasoning, I have told management and they do not do enough because it keeps happening. I have learned how to be a good customer service representative because I am friendly. The management at Walmart can be friendly, but I recommend you stay on their good side.

Difficult environment.,"Management sides with customers over associates even when associates are trying to follow the policies. It ends up being very hypocritical because if an associate did what management does they would quickly get fired, yet when management does it it makes the associate look bad.

Absolutely no overtime, unless the store manager approved which was only during christmas for a week. If you did have overtime you had to “adjust” your schedule or they would do it for you without your acknowledgement, which means they would take out your overworked hours in the time adjustment app. Asked to move my schedule to mornings, they started scheduling me to closing, only given 33 hours or less which didnt help financially.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier ,"Laveen, AZ",2/17/19,2019,2,17

"Love my job, not my leaders.","I love the work I do at wal-mart. I've held several Department Manager positions at Wal-Mart, I love learning new things. Each department is a little different in it's daily routine. The hardest part about the job is the lack of communication between managers as well as associates. Every manager is on a different page as to what they want from the associates. There is very little recognition for a job well done. You give them what they want and then they ask for more. There is very little appreciation. However Wal-mart does have great benefits and pay. We do earn paid time off. There is only one paid holiday.

"Good co-workers, poor communication, so-so customer service.","A typical day of work involves stocking merchandise, helping customers in ways such as running register, unlocking merchandise, or leading customers to items.  I learned that there are a lot of good people that work there, and the local managers do have good intentions, but their hands are unfortunately tied by what goes on at the corporate level.  The work place culture is ""okay, but not great"", because in a big store, the communication between employees is not where it needs to be.  The hardest part of the job is trying to juggle so many tasks at the same time, and also trying to balance work and life.  Another hard part of the job is trying to be trained on new things, because there are some things (such as phone contracts or photo maintenance) that only one or two people in the entire store know how to do correctly 100%.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and co-workers.  I think the CEO is okay, but some of the overall ideas of trying to stock in the middle of the day when there are tons of customers doesn't lead to great overall productivity.",2,Current Employee,Retail Worker--Mostly Electronics and Toys ,"Washington, MO",2/17/19,2019,2,17

Not a place I would want to work again.,It’s was one of my first jobs I had and it definitely opened up my eyes. Depending on the department you can either have a good department manager or not. Most of the time I never really had any guidance in doing things at Walmart. They pretty much just throw you out there and say go work.

"Loved The Job, Despised The Management","One of my favorite jobs is backroom and truck unloading, but the management was a mess and the supervisors were argumentative amongst themselves. In addition, once you complete what is considered ""Tier I"" of your training, you're supposed to receive a $1 raise, which doesn't seem like much, but trust me, it is. I was placed on the floor before I completed this Tier, which isn't unusual, but my supervisor refused to let me complete my training, and my manager didn't care that I wasn't keeping up with the track that they supposedly expect of you. I worked there for three months and never again saw the training computers. I never got that $1 raise either. Take away the negligent management and the dysfunctional system that they used as to how our day should be run, and it would be a lovely place to work. I just couldn't handle not being treated with basic respect. In the three months that I worked there, I saw half the Team I was on leave. Some went to other departments, whose jobs were less stressful and whose management was better, and others left to find other places of employment. I left to go back to school.

And then after a year of working full time hours as a part time employee they still didn't offer to officially sign me on as full time even though new hires were getting full time positions paperwork and everything right out of the gate. Then came the manager switch up and everything went horribly wrong. Hours were cut, they expected you to be done with things in an outrageous amount of time (as in I had to get something done by 6 when it wasnt even unloaded off the truck yet and it was 4:30 and my lunch was at 5). Then I came back from a vacation I had been waiting for for months that had been completely approved by management on the computer and all my time off was on the schedule showing I didn't work in that time only to get fired for not showing up on one of the days that had been approved off (which I showed them on my schedule but they claimed a computer error and said they had never accepted the time off).

Good Starting Place,"I was there originally for a good while. We used to get good raises on the yearly reviews now we don't. Ever since 2016, to give everyone the higher starting pay, you don't get the good vacation time, etc unless you are full time. And the yearly raise is a set percentage that everyone gets whether or not it is really deserved. We have had many managers over the years, and many people come and go throughout the job. It is what you make of it. Currently, even if one could get full time status here you would need another job for extra money especially if you have a family or are helping to take care of family.

A demanding and Ever changing Work Environment,"They press for optimal customer Service and time management like every retail position. They constantly change their policies and functions to try and best replicate a desirable work environment. However, the changes are too frequent and leave much to be desired, sometimes catching their associates off guard and leaving them without a job. Despite claiming flexibility, they often fire associates who choose to follow a flexible schedule, claiming insubordination. The management team tend to not communicate properly among themselves leaving their followers adrift in the wind, forcing them to play a game of manager of the day. There needs to be a stronger consensus between Wal-Mart and it's associates for it to come out on top over their leading competitor, Amazon.",3,Current Employee,Retail Sales Associate ,"Whitehall, MI",2/15/19,2019,2,15

Fresh CAP Associate - WORST Job Ever,"Depending on your store, this position can be the worse position ever. It is not the fact that the job is hard, it's the fact that supervisors and department managers are incompetent. They do not understand the new system, let alone care for the associates. They do not understand that if there is only two to four people working for 8 hours then it is impossible to finish breaking down and capping the truck,  do a morning cap, do the picks for both 1st and 2nd shift, do the markdowns, do donations in produce first and then do the meat, bakery, and deli areas as well. The store I worked in was completely biased and worked first shift, my shift, like slaves but treat the second shift, who do not even do their jobs properly, like kings and queens. _x000D__x000D_I've also had to deal with interpersonal drama between supervisors and department managers. Instead of being mature and working professionally, they bring their drama to work which created a toxic and stressful work environment. A lot of the supervisors and managers at my store are underqualified for their current positions. They did not know how to do their job. The hourly associates had to not only do our job, but the jobs of upper management. But when regional management appears, they want to appear like they are doing their job and blame the hourly associates for not working fast enough. I've witness several cases of bullying of new associates and I've witness disrespectful and intolerable attitudes and speech from Managers to their associates. And do not get me started on retaliation in the workplace..._x000D__x000D_FYI: This review is - more...",1,Current Employee,Fresh CAP Team Associate ,"Marietta, GA",2/15/19,2019,2,15

So is no need for Walmart to even have a policy because they don't follow the policy at all and Walmart they got a thing where they get in groups and they all lie on you they do conspiracy at Walmart they just do all types of illegal stuff that they don't supposed to do and they don't follow the HIPAA Law at all. And they the even the Personnel manager stay or horrible they do so many other color dirty so they let people day favored people work that still ours just do all types of stuff so I wouldn't recommend that job for anyone I wasted 5 and 1/2 on Walmart when I could have been doing something better at another job only thing that was a good benefits in me wasn't Insurance other than that they are horrible very horrible.,1,Current Employee,Customer Serviceand Money Center associate Bakery ,"Dallas, TX",2/14/19,2019,2,14

Repetitive,"Working as an apparel associate was ok, it was the customers that either made my day good or ruined my day. I liked management, they communicated effectively with each department and made the effort to advance and let us grow as a team. I did more than just be an apparel associate as they needed more people to take on other roles and fill in spots like cashiering or working in other departments.

I lost count of how many times I had to use my customer service skills to explain why something wasn't on the shelf for a customer. I worked at 2 different stores and saw virtually the same thing at both. Managers were overworked and stressed out and acted like that condition was normal. Upper management gave unrealistic deadlines with unrealistic expectations. I began to abhor the culture of greed and business first, employees second that seemed to be par for the course from day one. I expected a certain give and take from any company because there is a business to run, but Walmart doesn't really care about their employees. They are more interested in increasing profits at any cost they can get away with. I was always given way more work than I could do in a given day or even week and was expected to ""do the best I could"", but would then be held accountable if I didn't get it done. Advancement relied on what I called ""politicking"", meaning you had to get in good with the management staff in order to have a good chance at getting a position. The interview process was a joke. If they already had someone in mind for the position they would call in a few others for interviews just to keep up appearances and promote the one they wanted anyways, regardless of skill or ability.

"Advancement is possible, but training is insufficient.","Working at Walmart in an entry level position is simple enough, and the training both computer-based and personal is usually sufficient for almost anyone to handle the job.

Wasn't enjoyable,While working there they werent fair nor understanding. As a cart pushing I would be in the parking lot collecting carts while they were pageing for a carry out I would get yelled at by management because I didnt hear the announcement (no intercom system outside). I tried to request a radio to prevent the miscommunication in the future and they refused.

Fast pace made the day go fast.,A typical day at work was very busy. I handled customers all day everyday. I learned how to properly communicate with rude or impatient customers. The management didn't always do their job correctly. I felt as though they were giving other employees opportunities that weren't given to me. Anytime I requested time off it would never get approved. The hardest part of the job would have to be when there is a rush. You have to be fast but also be aware of customers and make sure that every item is accounted for.

Bad work enironment.,The hours are long. Do not report any concerns to management or they get angry with you. Management is not on hand to provide assistance when needed. Customers have to wait long periods of time to get any service and answers to questions. The culture in the work place is very unfriendly and employee's do not speak to each other. CMS yell and scream at cashiers and are on power trips. They walk around like they own the place. CMS are to focused on becoming a asst. manager and are very condescending to cashiers. You do not always get your breaks due to CMS not keep track of breaks. Standing all day and being yelled at.

typical day,"Clean, clean, clean is a typical day. You sweep part of the store, then your supervisor assigns you to a position for the night. Bathrooms and scrubbing the floors the is time consuming but the easiest. Stripping and waxing takes all night and is what I usually do on my shifts. First you strip all the old wax off and ensure that there are now brown spots or old wax on the floors before you apply the new wax. We have to use a push scrubber to do this process. We then wet the floor with water then we apply 8 coats of wax.

Fast-paced work place with an okay staff,"I honestly enjoyed my time being employed at Walmart. I met many amazing people and made a lot of wonderful friends there. However, I do believe that even if I had been hired on permanently that I would never be able to amount to anything more than a simple retail associate. I can't say the same for other Walmarts, but the one I was employed at was very close knit, and was just a group of people who didn't want newcomers taking their positions.

(Ex: Men's, Ladies, Shoes & Infants, etc.) Then, I'd go out onto the sales floor and into my area which I'd then zone, or otherwise, clean up.

Good managers seem to be hard to keep. The hardest part of this job I'd say is getting enough sleep as I work on the over night shift. that makes it hard to come in energized and ready for the night.

My opinions of Walmart,"I spent 8 years at Walmart and what was once a nice place to work has only become a place of profit for management. They are willing to take away people's bonuses and give it to the higher-ups, decrease the count of people and constantly expect more work out of people stressing everyone out.

Medical, Dental, Vision, 401k plus company match, stock options, and a bonus program. The cost for the benefits wasn't too bad, and the services themselves were decent. _x000D__x000D_What matters most is the management. To start with, there is too much of it. There is 1 store manager, 2 co-managers, at least a dozen assistant managers, a handful of support managers, and about 20 department managers and in my store, half of them did not want to work. The other problem is the hiring of new managers. They rarely hire the person who is best for the job. When you move up in the company they have to pay you for your years of experience and that costs money so they don't like doing it. They will hire someone who has no idea how to do a job and expect you, who got past up for the promotion,  to train them.The management at my store also refused to follow company police when it came to company programs designed to make the store function more smoothly and efficiently._x000D__x000D_With all that being said, it wasn't the worse place to work.

Oppurtunity to advance.,Started at Wal-Mart as an overnight stocker and moved into my current role as Overnight Support manager after 5 months. If you are a hard worker who shows up when scheduled and learn the ins and outs of your job you will go far with this company. I have benn offered Assistant but have turned it down due to not wanting to work 60 hrs a week. Upper management is distant and fail to follow company standards and fail to hold people accountable.

terrible,"From my experience,  management was terrible. They claim that you could come talk to them about problems but when you do they either make jokes abut the situation and or push it to the side with little to no change. They also showed favoritism to certain shifts/ positions leaving they least favorite shift/ position to do all the work.

Great benefits and can be fun with the right people.,I've worked multiple positions at walmart. Some are very physically demanding and other are more customer oriented. I've learned a lot about customer satisfaction and team building. The management is different at every location but they are big on promoting within so every manager has started from somewhere in the store. Which I think is really nice to know because it means that everyone has a chance to go somewhere with the company.

Decent pay for decent work,"Walmart is by no means an ""Employee friendly"" company. You are, from day one, nothing but a number to them and you will spend your entire career at Walmart worried about being fired for some reason or another.

Easy work. Filled with negative enery.,"Every position in Walmart is easy to fulfill. I would say it's one of the easiest companies to work for. Considering how easy the work is, I would say the pay is fair- especially, when you take into account all of their benefits._x000D__x000D_The problems come in when the workers don't want to do their part or overstep their boundaries. This makes the job more difficult due to picking up everyone else's slack or dealing with confrontations. Where there is supposed to be team work, some associates work harder than others. In addition, there's an abundance of gossip, giving Walmart quite a highschool feel. Which is not so far fetched since they proceeded to hire a plethora of teenagers from the local highschool. And they certainly did not come to do any actual work. _x000D__x000D_Then, there are managers that are either blatantly disrespectful/condescending or just want to be everybody's friend, thereby making them incapable of holding associates accountable for their wrongdoings. There are only two people in positions above me that I can say are ethical leaders._x000D__x000D_Furthermore, due to recent policy changes, the hours managers are allotted to give associates have decreased significantly and without warning. Many people that relied on their Walmart job as a main source of income now have little to no hours of work. And being that all the amazing benefits are based on whether you work full-time or part-time hours, all of employees that relied on Walmart for their health benefits will lose most of their benefits. Safe to say this is company has become less considerate of their associates' well being. - more...",2,Current Employee,Overnight Cashier ,"Zion, IL",2/7/19,2019,2,7

Rotten place to work,The management did more griping and criticizing than they did showing appreciation. All they cared about was their rates.

I learned that most employees do not like working the long hours and most of them have a second job to support their family. The management was alright despite being treated as replaceable workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace of customers.

Satisfying Chaos,"As an employee for this company of about 6.5 years, I certainly saw corporate policies and general value of employees increase over the years. New rules regarding relaxation of the dress policy was a major boost in morale for most associates. _x000D__x000D_I worked as a pharmacy technician for the entirety of my Walmart employment, and worked at several locations during that time. There is really a mixed bag of the types of managers you will get, and some are generally better than others (depending on your particular work style). If you enjoy working in a chaotic, fast paced environment (which I personally thrive in), then you will most likely enjoy working here. _x000D__x000D_While there is value in extensive training in some departments, from my experience there was not a lot of importance placed on training of pharmacy technicians save for random periods of time (their version of ""pathways"" training is a program called Pharmacy Tech University which you must complete during work hours except management rarely gives you the time to complete it). If you are new to working in a pharmacy and are the type of person who likes to do their job well right off the bat--then I wouldn't start a pharmacy tech career here. However, if you are like myself and start with no pharmacy tech experience--do not rely on learning some of the finer details from hands-on experience. While there is a lot of hands-on training involvement, there is a considerable value in studying independently in areas like pharmacy law and pharmacology (it will impact your performance considerably!)._x000D__x000D_There were a lot of angry customers - more...",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Mount Prospect, IL",2/7/19,2019,2,7

Just no. I wouldn't recommend Walmart.,"It's fine if you don't intend to talk to management much but ""family oriented"" as they claim isn't true at all. They say things like that to get you through the door. Certain managers at the Neighborhood Market near Meadowlark have such horrible attitudes and it makes you feel like you can't talk to them or ask questions. When I first started my shift, one of the managers looked me up and down without introducing herself and I had to ask other employees who she was. Certain managers will tell you what to do late (if you're new) then expect you to do it on THEIR time despite being new instead of letting you get acclimated to the aisles. Walmart could be amazing if management was friendly and accepting, not stand off-ish, unwelcoming and weird.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Winston Salem, North Carolina",2/7/19,2019,2,7

Great company to start if you want to move up quickly. turn over rate is fast because ppl cant handle the physical work, which isnt hard once you get adjusted to it which is 2-3 weeks typically, and thats when ppl start calling it quits. Managements recognizes and acknowledge your hard work. you get free company shirts every season that are different styles and colors, so thats 4 free shirts a year.

Not a great place,If you are part time you will not get many hours at all sometimes you are lucky to get 8 hrs a week .and some may get 19 hrs a week. They will hire in from other Walmart stores and knock you out of your job if you were currently in that position. It doesn't matter how long the other people have been with walmart. Say if they were there less time then you they can still take your job. Happened to me. So they put me in my secondary job just to get some few hours. They never allow overtime. And if you do get overtime they make you take long lunches or go home early just so they don't have to pay you that money. They will give you short shifts like for example 4.5 hrs. I don't know how they expect people to support their selves or a family on that. I don't even make my rent with that. Luckily my son works there and makes up the rest of the rent but on what few hours they give him we barely are able to buy groceries to last the 2 weeks before our next paycheck.

For someone that needs job experience,"If you like straightening up shelves, being rushed to empty return carts, sweating like a dog unloading trucks, or getting yelled at to gather carts in the parking lot because the people who were supposed to do it never showed up for work then this is your place! Management there was a joke, they'd yell at you for not working fast enough. Nothing was ever good enough. Alot of work for the pay. When they hire you on they don't tell you you'll be doing 50 jobs. Only work there if you need experience otherwise find someplace else.",3,Former Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Woodbury, NJ",2/7/19,2019,2,7
Life as Cashier,I love my job but the customers are the worst part of my job. They come to me as a cashier and complain about pricing when I literally stand in one spot all day and have no control over them at all. The CSM's or Customer Service Managers are sometimes difficult. Are never where you need them to be and disappears at the strangest time. Coworkers are sometimes not the happiest being at work but we do share some good laughs.,4,Current Employee,CASHIER ,"Memphis, TN",2/7/19,2019,2,7

Wal Mart would feed us on Holidays and breaks were manditory,"I would go in, get my equipment then head to whichever door i was assigned to. My department manager was fair with all of us.

Company does not know how to motivate associates,Constant rule changes to make things more difficult and to take things away . no holiday pay pto hours were cut. Associates don't have a voice when rule changes are in the works we need a union to look out for us . hours get cut all the time . live check to check and can barely feed my family with the hours they cut from me.,2,Current Employee,"Basic computer skills, Data entry, Spreadsheets ","Opelousas, LA",2/7/19,2019,2,7
Productive environment with employee benefits,"My typical work day included standing at one of the three store entrances and greeting/dismissing customers, while checking return orders, and calling attention to store security when needed.  I learned it is important to be friendly with any customers that will allow the interaction, as they can become your best supporters.  Management was a split thing, half were truly hard working, whether or not company showed up, the other half really only cared about review week.  Strong emphasis on Customer first with ads, but from the interior it was quite obvious that it was company first.  Telling people they could not do something, even if they already knew it, and having to deal with their anger, or outbursts.  Making people around me smile, or making children and their parents happy to shop at my store.",3,Current Employee,AP Customer Host ,"Sugar Land, TX",2/6/19,2019,2,6

I liked working there,Walmart was a good place to work for. I worked the overnight shift so it was quiet most of the time.

About walmart,"It's a very outgoing Job,I was there 8 years. It's probably good for a college or high school student. Out of 8 years I only made it to the pay rate of 11.50 not really where I wanna be at in life at the age of 32",3,Former Employee,Unloader/Stocker ,"Dallas, TX",2/6/19,2019,2,6
Cashier,"Being a cashier isn’t the best position because your hours will be inconsistent. Maybe you’ll have a open schedule which is from 6am-11pm or 12pm and they’ll make you work from 3pm-12pm and then they’ll want you to come the next day at 6am. If you have a closed schedule and you don’t have many hours, well tough luck you would not be able to get more hours. If you’re used to getting around 38 hrs/wk and you’re cut down to 10 hrs/wk well it’s better to get a better job because management won’t  care and will tell you to open up your schedule.",3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Dalton, GA",2/6/19,2019,2,6

Going Downhill,"Wal-Mart used to be a great place to work. Management began to dig in hard these past two years, eliminating hours, implementing poorly thought out rules, and ignoring employee opinions. I used to be able have a steady income, with a decent wage, but my hours began to dwindle to nothing.

Less than satisfying training but a fun place to work once I got the general idea of what was expected of me.,Walmart has a great support management team. As long as I did my work as fast as I could there were no complaints against me. One hour lunches and 2 paid 15 minute breaks. You may leave the property for your lunches. Punching in and out may be interrupted by internet disruptions and power outages. Sometimes things get busy but with a coordinated team effort the job gets done in a timely and efficient manner.,5,Former Employee,Floor Tech-Maintenance Department ,"Metairie, LA",2/6/19,2019,2,6
Coworkers are great to work with.,I've been working for Walmart 4 days and since day one I have been harrassed about speeding up my productivity.

Do not work for monroe walmart deli/bakery,"This job was fun at first, especially since it helped me start learning about food and all. I noticed that one race was heavily favored not just in deli/bakery, but throughout the store it seemed. I was told that I would be a cake decorator after I learned the basics in deli, but in the four or five months I was at this store, I did not get trained at all in any of bakery. We kept getting new assistant managers and no one would tell us. A couple of the favorites associates will talk down on you and belittle you like there is no tomorrow! The store manager told us that we need to leave at our scheduled time to do so, but those favorites associates would make me start something before I had to go home and wouldn't let me clock out until it was finished, which would be 30 minutes to an hour after I was supposed to leave.

Not worth the money,"Very long busy days. You can learn a few different things depending on your position but rarely have the chance to move up in the store. workplace culture is suppose to feel like a family ""walmart/sam's quote/logo"" but they want you to work yourself to death and it's an every man for themselves kind of job. They don't try to work with flexible schedules, if you ask for one the you will most likely be a cashier. Bonuses are rare and they tie it to your attendance now. Double/triple points if you call out on weekends.

Not recommended,Recent changes have shown employees how little we matter. My experience with management has left me speechless with their lack of caring about their employees. Its like working with a bunch of second graders at times with all the lying and backstabbing that is done.  It used to be somewhat fun working for this company but the last few years everything has changed and the best thing that could be happen would be to get fired. And that is coming from several people who are no longer with the company.

I learnt a lot about products: placement, proper display, back room storage, stocking,and how to correctly put claim ticket on damaged items. Also learnt basic mod setup procedures.  _x000D_ The managers I dealt with at the store are amazing. I had schedule issues due to being a spouse of a disabled military veteran and having a child in grade school.  They worked with me on my schedule, and checked in with me regularly. _x000D_ Hardest part is being understaffed. I understand there is a Bring Your Own Device app now. Did not have that, and most non-manager floor associates do not have access to the hand held, and it was not pleasant trying to hunt one down, and that's if you could find an associate who didn't need the use of it. _x000D_ Most enjoyable part for me were the meetings.

"If you like good management, you needn't apply.","I personally feel like I should be able to look up to my manager and treat them as a friend, not go into work believing they were looking for reasons to coach me or get my fired the minute they knew I was on the clock.

We have to work 30 hours to earn on protected PTO hour and about 41 hours to earn a regular PTO hour. So unless pregnant or on FMLA we have to work even when sick.

Overworked,"A typical day within the Wal-Mart organization will last anywhere from 13-16 hours. There are several meetings during the day to make adjustments to changes (meeting or not meeting goals). There is little time for managers to have breaks, which result in them eating quickly or missing meals. The autonomy to make sound decisions is rare. Consequently, the managers often feel powerless. Often changes are made to managers’ schedules with little notice, which is difficult for single parents and those with young children. Wal-Mart does provide sufficient knowledge of logistics and the supply chain. What it does not provide is consistency. The framework is archaic; this includes software and some technology.  This structure leaves little time to develop positive relationships with employees. Often they feel overworked, silenced, and unmotivated to complete tasks to the best of their ability.",2,Former Employee,"Area Manager, Distribution Center ","Bentonville, AR",2/5/19,2019,2,5

"Very stressful, fun workplace","Cashiering can be stressful sometimes. Sometimes you get rude customers that yell at you about being in a rush or bagging their things wrong. Then you have nice customers who ask about your day and tell you stories about their days. Usually it's better when the day is busy and fast paced because the time goes by so quickly. When the store is slow that's when the day really drags on.

Management was not understanding and not willing to help when help was needed.,"The job as a cashier was not bad at all. The attitude of the management is what made the job so difficult.

Stressful Workplace,"A typical day at work sometimes can be a good day, as long management does not complain about anything. I learned that you always have to do your job in the best of your abilities. Bad management who never takes responsibility for their own actions instead they point fingers at the employees which is very unfair. Management always tell you to speak your mind, but when you do, they cuts you off while you're talking. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the employees who are not managers at all.",1,Current Employee,Cart Pusher ,"Suffolk, VA",2/5/19,2019,2,5

"Overall great, but worried for the future","Been with the company 5 years now. The 1st 4.5 were great and I loved every minute of it. But now I fear the company is going in a dark direction. Upper Market and regional management has become very disrespectful to salaried managers at the store level, the company continues to elevate standards and expectations while giving store less manpower to do it. Still a very good company to work for if you're hourly, but if your salary it's rough now. _x000D__x000D_It makes me sad because I still love the company, and they are doing some great things, but the bad days are starting to outnumber the good as they get way too desperate to compete with Amazon.",4,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,Ohio,2/5/19,2019,2,5

Summary,"a typical night at Walmart was always overwhelming it didn't matter if you work grocey or merchandise, its workload was harder in some areas than others and when that is the case an associate would have to do to areas a night and all associates had to help in the grocery area every night but seldom did grocery associates helped in the merchandising area, also certain times of year especially from October to December the work load is extremely overwhelming and the production level is extremely high, no one in mangement appreciate your time or effort at all, every now and then you might get a manager that would show a itsy bitsy piece of appreciation(seldom), however the most enjoyable part at working for Walmart is getting that discount(which could be higher than 10%), shopping there, and even helping some ,not all of the customers. Walmart is getting worse instead of getting better when it comes to their employees",2,Former Employee,overnight stocker ,Georgia,2/5/19,2019,2,5

They no longer have that position anymore,5,Former Employee,Overnight Fresh Sales Associate ,"Martinsville, IN",2/5/19,2019,2,5
What they say is not what they do.,Walmart culture is they want to take care of associates but they do not do that. Walmart management will lie on you to get you fired and the investigations that associates are supposed to have to counter those things are a joke. They are investigated by the HR reps that the store manager has known for years and are friends with.,2,Former Employee,Assistant manager ,"Donaldsonville, LA 70346",2/5/19,2019,2,5
working at walmart,"Busy day at Walmart, I learned that when you work hard and at a fast paste your day goes by faster and smoother.

Very uncaring toward employees,"During peak season (Christmas Holidays) we were forced to work 6 days a week or get fired. For my shift, this meant working three 12hr days and 3 days that ranged anywhere from 10 - 12hrs. I averaged about 68 hours a week - mandatory. People are not allowed to sit down during their shift. We were on our feet the entire time. We were allowed two 25 minute breaks. The 25 minutes included the time it took you to walk across the warehouse to the breakroom and back to your area after break. After fighting through the crowd to get food and warm it up, we might have had about ten minutes to actually sit._x000D__x000D_After peak season they still made unreasonable demands on our time - only giving two or three days notice of mandatory overtime days. They made us work Thanksgiving but did not give us holiday pay (we had been there less than 90 days). _x000D__x000D_We were forced to go through a security checkpoint whenever leaving the floor. If someone had snacks in their pocket -even if they had the receipt showing they bought it - they were fired. A lot of the employees were young and had terrible attitudes. It was a very unprofessional, stressful work environment.",2,Former Employee,warehouse associate ,"Atlanta, GA",2/5/19,2019,2,5

Its a multitasking place,Walmart is not a bad place to work at. Is a very fast going place to work at. Some customers are awesome and so some you really have to have people skills.

Not a good place to be unless part-time,"I'm not a disgruntled employee, just trying to get the word out. Being a recent employee, the management is very poor, they will always try to push your buttons to try and get you fired. One particular manager will always test you by bringing your freight out late and expect it and the rest of your work to be done within withing two hours and no OT allowed. You're always being forced to do things that are not in your job description, yes it's beneficial to your resume, but you're also putting both your job and their job on the line. Walmart is and extremely demanding job, at least the department I worked in, very physical and mentally exhausting. There's no communication via managers, every manager says something different and do not communicate with other shifts, which often leaves everybody out of the need to know basis. Definitely preferable treatment going on. Would not recommend this place unless it's a part time job while going to college/ staying at home. Schedules are not easy to work around and takes talking to a lot of managers to get it approved. As with hours, some people aren't scheduled for days, sometimes a week or so, all due to corporate trying to save a buck.  Lots of overriding the clock needed.",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Pooler, GA",2/5/19,2019,2,5
What can you say... It's Wal-Mart.,"For all the horror stories you hear about Wal-Mart, I can honestly say in my experience it wasn't all that bad.

The store is filled with customers who cant seem to put 1+1 together without your help, often times customers will berate you, threatin your life and try to walk all over you becuase of where you work. Although I worked in a small walmart, with great bunch of teammates; I only enjoyed my coworkers for their personality. When it came to jobs, my coworkers sucked at everything, many times associates would not be willingly to learn simple job skills. My coworkers were lazy, unprofessional, and often times misleading customers. Mangement is a bunch of of behind kissers, spend their time in the office doing nothing, with only a few good managers who work hard and get fired while the evil managers stay. Once you work for this company you are expected by management to know everything the first day, you are expected to know every department.

Coworkers were fun to work with but managers left something to be desired,I worked overnights for Walmart. Most of the time the managers would let the workers they liked and talked to skimp out on work while forcing others to work more and harder to pick up that slack.

It's a Living,"The best part about working at Wal-Mart are the people you work with; since everyone is in the same position, there's a lot of teamwork that goes on. At the location I worked, the senior members of the staff actually looked out for and helped to train the new staff members, and everyone tried to watch each other's backs. The work itself is tedious and thankless, neither of which is made any easier when you have to deal with customers, suppliers or contractors. A lot of people assume that what employees can and cannot do is by their own choice when in fact the vast majority of your day-to-day activities are planned out on the national level from the corporate offices. Attempting to change these rules usually leads to termination or punishment. Add to that the fact that management treats their employees as incompetent and will not take accountability for their own misbehavior; it leads to a rather toxic work environment.",2,Former Employee,Senior Accountant ,"Houston, TX",2/4/19,2019,2,4

Walmart is for slaves,They work you until you want to give up and then fire you. The pay is never worth the amount of work and disrespect that takes place. You can give them your all but they’ll just toss you so that they can subject someone new to the process. Then eventually do the same with them. No overtime (even if you’ve already worked it).

If you are only working 7 hours a day in a 4 day work week(3 days for weekends), your averaging 28 hours or less a week. That's no money its basically a part-time warehouse now. They have ran all long term associates away and are nonchalant about it. They micro-manage everyone and watch over your shoulders constantly.

Thankless job without any security.,"It started as a great place to work. Then they started taking everything away. They took away paid holidays, sick time, personal time and deferred holidays. We had profit sharing, which was taken away. We had a good quarterly incentive which is now nearly unattainable. The production rates keep being raised and are now extremely difficult to achieve. They actually attempted to give us less than the state law requires for meal periods by giving less than 20 minutes for first break. They were turned in to the labor department. They returned the 20 minute first break but second break is now about 15 minutes. In place of a pay increase, for two years they gave a bonus. Then two years later they gave an increase but took the bonus away, so we effectively received a pay cut. When they took the sick, personal, holiday and vacation time and turned it all into PTO, they gave us 20 less hours per year. The management is horrendous. Good workers don't receive promotions. Those are given based on how well you can suck up. There are many other reasons to stay away. I can't think of all of them at the moment.",1,Current Employee,RSR Driver ,"Spring Valley, IL",2/4/19,2019,2,4

Occasionally you'll alternate to the deli, but I primarily worked as a baker_x000D_. _x000D_The managers weren't too sure what they wanted associates doing, and would spontaneously take you from what you were doing to switch you over to deli/bakery. It was very confusing, and I'd personally recommend they just stick to assigning jobs to associates, instead of trying to give a million things to do to every Fresh Associate. _x000D__x000D_Coworkers here range from sweet old ladies baking cakes, to typical drama high school students who think their job is time to be on their phone, and then blame the work they didn't do on another associate. _x000D__x000D_You get benefits after 90 days of working there full-time, and theres no overtime. You have to clock in right on time, and clock out not a minute after your 8th hour. If you do this too much they'll give you marks. _x000D__x000D_You get a 1 hour break, and two 15 minute breaks. You must clock out during these breaks. _x000D__x000D_So, other than the petty drama, and managers hardly knowing what to do with you, it's a solid job.

They are starting to focus mainly on part time, and this is due in part to people demanding high wages, and part to the belief that 3 part time people can do more work than one full time which in their view helps create jobs.  They do hire at greater than base minimum wage to start which is a plus and your experience plays a part in that which speaks to their wilingness to recognize accomplishments outside of Walmart.  Associates are at times asked to perform to standards which are not possible to reach, such as one cake decorator being asked to do 4 wedding cakes in one 8 hour shift.  I would also like to see them go back to a uniform-based dress code.  I believe uniforms help customers recognize associates no matter which direction they are facing, and lends an air of professionalism.  They also need to consistently adhere to food safety practices, specifically the rule about eating and drinking in the food prep areas.  I understand about tasting food, but this can be done by putting a sample in a sample cup and moving away from the prep area.  Gum should never be allowed, neither should candy or cough drops, since you can't guarantee you aren't dripping saliva on the food or that the gum/candy won't fall in the food on accident.

Stress from most management not caring,"Management needs to know what each other are doing. One minute there will be one manager telling you to do this, then the next minute there is another one telling you that what you are doing is totally wrong.

Horrible Management,"This has to be the worst place I have ever worked. The management play favorites. Even if you have the knowledge to be a manager they won't promote you unless kiss up. They don't accept doctors excuses. So if you need the time off for medical related issues you better forget it. I have gout and needed to go home because I couldn't put pressure on my foot without falling over and I was told by an assistant manager that she couldn't do anything for me. I witnessed an older coworker fall over because they had these giant clothing racks in the back room that took up so much space and blocked the entrance to the back room. Only then did they replace the racks with smaller ones with yellow tape on them so people could see. I was harrassed by management on a daily basis. Even though I was one of the harder workers in the place. You don't work in just one place either you are forced to be crossed trained in every Department. I was a sporting goods associate and I knew how to do anything except fresh side(grocery). I know what you're thinking that's a positive thing makes you more valuable...not the case they expect more out of you and if you don't get all your work done you get ""coached"" disciplined. Even though they call you up to run register all night. Oh yeah you will be register trained unless you speak very little English then they don't bother you. I have heard every single manager use vulgar sexist language. I have heard them put down employees.

Most people keep to themselves as they are focused on working. Customer service could be championed a bit more.,"A typical day at work could be draining or relaxing. Depends on how busy you keep yourself and if keeping busy gives you any internal satisfaction. I learned how to opperate a walky-stacker whitch is an electronic pallet jack that can lift palletes of goods to and from storage. Management did their best but I was sometimes left wondering if they were all properly communicating with each other. Work place culture was an odd mix of Youngens with no real direction, Old folks with no options left, and extremely introverted individuals. The hardest part of the job was probably just dealing with the cold fingers you would get from handling frozen items.

Very hard to balance with life,"I felt working for this company was not the worst however the work environment was stressful and the balance between life and the job was not easy if at all possible due to the crazy hours even as a full time employee who asked for a fixed schedule and was told that's what I would get going in. I felt as an ogp and online pickup. Asscocoate at a supercenter the job was a bit much and having more coworkers or one more manager would have been helpful, due to always being short handed. The rules of how things were changed constantly and management was drastically being cut by the weeks due to corporate changes which was very unhelpful to us workers. I just felt the company did not take pride in the workers hired and they felt we were all just another body desperate for a job. And It was a very disconnecting feeling and made me very anxious showing up everyday because the stress placed on individuals was high. They also would work you 8 days in a row if need be and schedule changes were an annoyance to upper management, which in turn made life really difficult for a student and or busy person.",3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Lewisburg, PA",2/2/19,2019,2,2

The managers & workers do their best everyday, some more than others but nevertheless they were the ones who made the environment laid back & productive. I would say the hardest part of the job would be when the pressure of trying to get things done was too much, but you have to overcome that pressure & get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely when I met the other coworkers because we helped each other out & did the best of our ability.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Anchorage, AK",1/31/19,2019,1,31

Poor management and inconsistent work schedule,"Management oftentimes changed schedules under our noses which resulted in often inconsistent work schedules, and they often cut hours with no extra shifts to pick up. During my time there, there was a workplace incident where I was the victim of theft by two employees and management failed to respond with action accordingly when I informed the store manager and those two employees were still allowed to work with no repercussion. The job itself was enjoyable, especially if you like the fact-paced nature of the job, but management may be lackluster.

Poor Management,"The management there was terrible! All of the managers would take breaks at the same time if they wanted and there was no one to help assist a customer if they needed something done. The store manager was not doing his job properly and showed favoritism amongst certain assistant managers. It was also poor management as far as employees, if an employee is lazy they aren't told to pick up the pace, instead the hardworking employees had to pick up their slack. It was almost like it's your fault if you want to do your best at your job, now you have to take on more responsibilities because someone else doesn't want to do their job. However at this job I have met and networked with a lot of different people. I would say the only good thing about the job were the people that came in. It was great talking to the customers, I've learned new things I haven't learned before and it has help me enhance my ability to speak to others, what seems appropriate to say and what doesn't. I do thank Walmart for this because it has taught me how to connect with people. My greeting put smiles on the people's walking in and out those doors, most said ""You don't belong here, you're too nice!"" Those were the best times of my day and that is what kept me going. The harassment was also another issue that some of my coworkers have faced. There were also people in the job that worked for 3 or 4 years with no promotions available to them when they have been working for it for as long as they've been there.

There is no future with Walmart,I worked five years with the company and was making the same amount of money as the person that was just hired. My specific store had a 100% turnover rate.

stressful,"Walmart is a very stressful weight to have on my shoulders due to the way the store is run, and nothing to do with the customers. Walmarts managers do not communicate with eachother verywell, if at all. Walmart has plenty of people to work for them but they do not schedule enough people to cover anypart of anygiven day, they are always pulling assocites from other departments to cover shifts and by doing so they put that department behind.

"Harsh Work Environment, Great Benefits","Walmart has a lot of unnecessary stress from management and home office.  Home Office often sets unreasonable goals, such as 10,000 price changes in one day, then management expects one to get them out of the system, encouraging you to process them without working them, if necessary.  Process changes coming from home office were sometimes unworkable on the sales floor, yet the people who tried to explain that were fired for being ""resistant to change"". Later the program would be abandoned because it didn't work.  As a manager, you were encouraged to agree to get along rather than report real results, and to push bad results down to your subordinates and write them up, rather than fix the problems._x000D__x000D_One should be willing to work almost every weekend and every holiday.  There will be times when hours are cut drastically to fit the store's budget. In my experience, Walmart will not work around the schedule of a second job.  _x000D__x000D_The benefits are great.

management,If you are a general employee the job is not bad.  Managers are not given constistant help to insure sucess. The management school is offered to late to have impact.

Bad management,They preach team work but put it all one one person. Management doesn't communicate at all. Does not allow over time it's actually frowned upon.

"Great experience, covering half of the store due to low staff","Low prices come at a cost. In 1 shift I was expected to cut keys, cashier, mix paint, cut fabric, develop photos AND do my own job, being 1/3 employees in the entire store that understood how to use our specialized online systems(including management making probably 3x my wage).

The Walmart Experience,The job is very fast paced and stressful. Management team could use some work but overall its not terrible. The benefits Walmart gives you are great but the pay does seem a little lack luster considering when you go into the management field. The responsibilities out weight the pay most days.

Good Job. Awful Management.,"I really liked this job, and was sad to have to leave as suddenly as I did, but I just couldn't bare to go another day. The managers do not talk to you unless they need you for something in that moment, period. They will cut corners off hours so you're functionally working a full time week for only part time pay and benefits. They will not speak properly, as someone with a hard time hearing, I have no choice but to ignore them and hope it wasn't important, or ask again only for them to mumble even more out of annoyance. We never have enough workers. I've had staff promise me new machines and new help for months and months and months, which never came, of course. Our equipment is barely functional and breaks on a regular basis, each time it takes at least a week to get fixed. Even in the rare case equipment works alright, we don't have enough people to keep up with the needs of the store. This is not a problem of worker scarcity, they always get new people in when they really want to, and they have people to spare that attempted to help at times (though often they'd just get in the way because they had no training for my job). Even when we have enough people, no thought goes into our schedule. Traffic does not pick up until around 10 AM are our store every day, so with proper scheduling of 3 part timers working 5 days a week, we should *never* have to work an entire day with no help at any point.

Wal-Mart wasn't trustworthy,"My first three years at Wal-Mart went well but after earning three yearly raises, they suddenly became critical of things by making up faults you didn't do.  When two people work on the same drawer during the same shift and the drawer isn't counted down until the end of the night, then the first or last cashier shouldn't be accountable for a shortage greater than five dollars at the end of the day.  If I was the sole cashier on a single register and the count didn't match then I would be accountable, but it is not possible to blame one cashier for a shortage if multiple cashiers worked on the same register.  Being blamed for calling a hotline number after I was threatened by a co-worker was the last straw.  She should have been fired and they didn't fire her and I don't know why because it was in the handbook that any employee who threatens another employee with any bodily harm whatsoever would be terminated.  That never happened so I called the hotline to complain and followed company procedure in doing so as I went through the chain of command to ask why she wasn't left go after they knew she threatened me. I felt that they weren't concerned and twisted the facts around so that I would leave and they would not have to pay me another raise for another year. Shortly after I left Wal-Mart went to hiring most of their workers as Part time instead of full time. This was in the Newspaper in articles published about the problems Wal-Mart had in the early years after 2000.",3,Former Employee,4 Star Cashier ,"North Canton, OH",1/28/19,2019,1,28

Stressful Environment with Little Room for Advancement,"Essential departments are paid lower wages than less essential, overtime hours are punished but required for most positions to meet goals, upper management shows observable disconnect from everyday activities and lower management shows extreme stress from the latter.

I really should have thought your daily task should come from your department manager. I feel like management didn't communicate well with each other.

An okay job to earn a paycheck,"When i first started at walmart, it was an amazing place to work. I had come from working fast food and one thing I learned working fast food was it was fast paced and stressful with less pay. Walmart can be a great place to work. However, management makes it very difficult to enjoy your job. You make a decent amount when compared to other jobs but sometimes the stress management puts on you is not worth the pay. The morale at my store is terrible because alot of people are overworked and not getting the hours they deserve. Walmart likes to cut corners. I work as a maintenance associate and they like to use us to do alot of things that are out of our job discription because they dont want to hire people to do that specific job. Typically, we end up having to do our maintenance duties as well as other jobs such as stocking a particular department or helping in the backroom etc... Work orders for equipment as well as basic equipment we need to clean the store are limited, leaving us to sometimes have to adapt and find a way to get certain job duties accomplished. In my opinion, this is a good job to have if you're looking for easy money, but if you're looking to advance here at walmart, i would look to advance at another company that actually cares about their employees because walmart does not.",2,Current Employee,Maintenance Associate/Stocker ,"Colorado Springs, CO",1/26/19,2019,1,26

"Overall, a good company","I enjoyed the time I spent at Walmart for the most part. Some of management is amazing, and some of them are horrible. Often times, it's under-staffed throughout most of the store, which puts a lot of pressure on employees. Overall, it was still a great place to work for a number of reasons. They constantly find reasons to provide food for all of the employees (BBQs, pizzas, subs, etc.). There were quarterly bonuses if the store did well. They offer insurance after 1 year and PTO after 3 months (accumulates very slowly at first). They always worked with my scheduling needs. The pay system for long-time employees needs fixed.

I generally got good hours and the pay was okay. Only issues I had were, I was employed as a cashier and was more often than not put on the service desk which is a higher paying job, and while I was often on the service desk I was never moved to a service desk position so I was doing the job but not being compensated for it. Also the management at Walmart doesn't seem to care about their employees in the least. I witnessed them make an employee sit by the office with a deep slice in her forearm for around 30 minutes while they got their paperwork together before she was allowed to go to the hospital. I worked in lawn and garden and watched a manager tell an employee who was injured, and had doctor's orders that she wasn't to be on her injured foot, that she couldn't sit on a stool at the cash register and she had to get up and help move plants and such or she had to go home, and if her missing work caused her to be terminated that it didn't matter because their were plenty of people looking for jobs. I also heard of them getting upset at a pregnant employee for not painting while they were remodeling their store. While it's a good job, management doesn't care about their employees in the least. The only time I saw them show concern to an employee was when a female employee slipped in water in their restroom where there was no wet floor sign and hit her head.

MAnagement is frantic and unorganized most of the time and somehow still operates somewhat smoothly.,a typical day at work can vary based on your postion. most positions will require you to know your job within a few weeks and then you'll be thrown into OTJ training with little assistance from supervisors (again depending on your position). If your lucky to have a manager(s) that is organized you will have a decent exprience. Also expect to constantly assist or takeover department duties in another department when they are short-staffed even if your the only one in your assigned department.

When the old store manager was there Walmart ran so smooth but it isn't the same anymore. Everyone cared about the customers and now it is all about getting the freight out and your work done. So basically that is just saying for get the customers and do your work. It even got down to the point to where the managers are threatening the associates with being couched to where if you have 3 couching then your fired. Things have definitely changed for Walmart and now I wouldn't recommend anyone working there.,4,Former Employee,Support Manager/Fresh Cap One Supervisor ,"Elk City, OK",1/24/19,2019,1,24

Walmart Review,A typical day at work for me was busy. There were moderate paced work flow times during my work days. I learned to always stay aware and prepared for work. Something that was confirmed for me was that complete focus and confidence is needed to complete job duties. I had no problems with the management at Walmart and enjoyed working under the managers. They were very helpful and dedicated to their job. They also had no problem handling changes in the company and responded very well when there were changes. The workplace culture is really strong and I would like to call it inviting. The hardest part of the job is making sure every single customer is pleased. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work in an environment where work is continuous and not tedious.,5,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Wake Forest, NC",1/24/19,2019,1,24

"Great Associates,Great Pay, Hard Work","Fast paced job. Have to deal with rude customers, wrong priced items and items not marked with a price. Csm's aren't always there when you need them and this makes the customer wait and the line grow longer. You either get your break too early or too late. Same goes with lunch. They are good with approving time off if requested early. Overall, your day will go quickly and you will work hard. They pay $15.00/hr  now, so that makes it worth it. You also receive quarterly bonuses and can buy stock and contribute to the 401k plan. Availability must be open with a flexible schedule because you will work a different schedule everyday. You can also swap shifts with other employees using an app. Beware about calling out and being late. Walmart gives points for callouts and half points for being late. You're allowed 4 points and then after 6 months, you have 5 more points added on, totaling (9). If you reach 4 under 6 months, you're terminated. You're terminated after 9 points, if you're there more than 6 months. This company doesn't accept doctor's notes, either.",5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"North Bergen, NJ",1/24/19,2019,1,24

Instead I get walked on and when I use my voice, I am the bad guy. I was tired of all the drama that they kept saying I am falling into and I wasnt. I just kept getting in trouble and the supervisor walked away with nothing. It was furiating so one night I quit working clocked out on her and left and went to come in the next day to talk to the manager and he kept it as is and we parted ways. I was hoping to come in and finish my 2 weeks but they didnt want to.",1,Former Employee,n/a ,"Gainesville, FL",1/23/19,2019,1,23

Lack of care for employees,Walmart is great to work for until you have worked for them. The management team is lacking in the area of care for customers and employees. The management team treats the employees like garbage. The managers care more about the numbers than they do about the quality of service or cleanliness. They also need to work on their training skills. Employees are put in their positions to do their job with a few simple computer tests and no actual hands on training. A typical day at work is not expecting your managers to listen to anything you say because you are not important enough for them to bother with. I learned that not all managers are professional. I also learned that if you are a friend of a manager they will overlook the fact that you spend your break getting high in your vehicle.,1,Current Employee,Walmart Sales Associate ,"Mineola, TX",1/23/19,2019,1,23
Was no room for promotion,"As I continued to work there, I noticed the seniority that was taking place and there was no room for promotion when some employees have been their for numerous years.

Good Luck, the benefits given at this company are the best I've seen.",5,Former Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Vandalia, IL",1/23/19,2019,1,23
Management needs more training,"Dont get me wrong, the company is a good company to work for, they offer benefits and 401k, the training is there if you become a Department Manager, you will meet workers that has been there for more than 10years. Management changes from time to time. It depends on if the Store Manager gets promoted or get fired. ASM's changes since they can transfer to other locations or get promoted too. Currently our SM isnt really the supportive one, not even motivating, so some workers are leaving the store. Even the ones who has been working there for so long. The pay when I started back in 2009 was $9 and you get raises annualy and then that's only if you get a good evaluation. Promotion depends on who you know than how you work. And then when you do get promoted, it depends on your ASM, if you get lucky and have a good one, they'll always help you out but if you get to have the new ones, you'll have to train them as well. What you learn in training is too good to be true, its hard to actually execute them when not everyone really knows their roles and responsibilities so instead of setting the whole store to success, its always on the down low BUT this review is based on the store where I work at in Fremont. Been working in and out there for almost 9 years and its been a year of worst scenarios. Each stores run differently and some are lucky to have a management team who are really doing their jobs.",1,Current Employee,APPAREL DEPARTMENT MANAGER ,"Fremont, CA",1/23/19,2019,1,23
Not as terrible as people make it out to be,"The walmart company has a lot of good policies in place. The horror stories you read about low pay etc are mostly false.

Work with unorganized management giving you a load of tasks that require more than 1 person,Working at Walmart the past 3 and a half years taught me to be a more patient person when working in retail. No matter what position you hold at Walmart be prepared to learn everything else within the store as time goes on because at times employees will not show up for work and management expects you to take over two positions at once. My particular position required me to do the work of at least 2 people because we were understaffed and management refused to hire any new employees putting more pressure on a small team like mine. We had a total of 6 employees when at least 10-14 were required so work was always stressful and never relaxing.

Great job to earn experience in a big company but poor management,"Great initial work environment but management was lacking in the ability to attone for their mistakes especially within the first 6 months, due to their point system of attendance if your availability says you are blocked out for certain days whether for school or other matters if you were to call out due to it you would be penalized for them not being able to follow or fix their scheduling mishaps, especially when it came to management not confirming schedule changes with associates, so  recommend you check your schedule daily or else you could get in trouble for managements lack of leadership. All in all it is a good job environment other than management, it is a fun fast paced learning environment to learn the skills of major merchandising.",4,Current Employee,Sales/Backroom/Merchandising Associate ,"Saint Cloud, FL",1/22/19,2019,1,22
Employment at Walmart,"Overall, I feel like Walmart is a stepping stone for most. Being employed at Walmart is a good first experience or good first taste into the world of retail. It's normally fast paced and busy. Who doesn't go to Walmart for SOMETHING? With that being said, I've been employed by two different Walmart stores and in two different counties. Both places I have some positive experiences to remember. At my first store I started out as a cashier, it was a new experience for me in retail. I didn't know what I was up against, but I had VERY LITTLE to no training. It was a busy time of year and the store was a little under staffed. That was a down side for me just starting my first night, but it also pushed me to learn! 6 months later I was promoted to Customer Service. About 2 years later, I transferred due to moving. I continued my Customer Service position and about 6 months later the store was under a remodel, opening a  Money Center. Once the remodel was over and the Money Center was opened, I was welcomed to a new position. Which detailed check cashing, numerous different bill payments, wire transfers all over the world and money orders. Walmart is a huge franchise with most stores being fairly large, sometimes things fall out of place. Examples being a HUGE lack of communication, levels of respect in some cases, lack of management and poor scheduling issues. There's something to take from each job! Make a positive experience and have a positive outcome!",4,Former Employee,Money Center Cashier ,"Aberdeen, MD",1/22/19,2019,1,22

Walmart pros and cons,"Really the only pro is the co workers. Overnights become a family. Everything else is a con. Poor management, favoritism, management talking about personal matters of their associates with other associates. They refused to follow my drs note when I was pregnant. One said no pulling heavy things. Both said no extra breaks. My dr note said extra breaks as needed and zero pulling of carts and pallets. I put in my two weeks and the manager I gave it to wrote my personal number on it and left it laying around somewhere so it never made my file and now I’m black listed to going back (was debating on a different shift after baby was born so I had different managers but can’t now. One manager is getting investigated for unwanted  advances (tried to put his hands down an associates pants). Men can go to the bathroom for 30-45 minutes at a time but women get questioned for taking 5 minutes extra outside of breaks to potty when pregnant or change feminine needs",3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Plano, IL",1/22/19,2019,1,22

I  enjoyed what I was doing,I liked what I was doing but the management left a lot to be desired. I felt that they were very biased and were harder on me than deserved.

Entertaining environment at times,"Like any work environment there are always pros and cons. I will be completely honest. I started through a temp agency in summer 2016 as an associate and I became a permanent hire the folllwoing September. Quickly I promoted to a specialty in less than my first year (took more than once to get promoted). Advancing at Jet really determines how well you know the managers, how well they know you and IF they want you to be part of their team. You could be the best worker but ultimately they choose who they want to promote regardless. I was part of the training and development team. Right away I wanted to be the best trainer but quickly I learned that the Training department lacked accountability. My team members would constantly talk down on our job, and often I felt like my managers had no idea what was going on or even cared. When I first started at Jet yes it was fun. It has become a more corporate work environment since 2016 and I often felt that I was overqualified for what I was doing. Nonetheless if you want a job that pays you for doing brain numbing functions go for it. If you’re smart you’ll stay in school. Growth opportunities at this company are hit and miss. I really felt like it was a dead end for me. Pay checks were nice, money isn’t always everything. Side note: once I was getting harassed and both my manager and I talked to HR about it, where they told me (Courtney BP specifically) they couldn’t do anything about it.",2,Former Employee,Specialist ,"Edgerton, KS",1/19/19,2019,1,19

Fast paced,"With how few registers they have after getting a lot of self checkout registers, you would have to constantly be rushing through checking people out because the lines would be filled with people that don’t like the self checkouts. I learned how to manage my time effectively especially when I got to be a backup csm so I could get all my tasks done and take care of the customers and my fellow associates. It’s a good place to move up at if you show the managers that you have a good work ethic. You also get along really well with everyone and it has a family like vibe.

For 1 no matter the emergency or reason there is a point system when you start and continue but that can determine if you stay or go not your work ethic. No matter if you have doctor's note or anything a point is a point and if you is all of your points you are terminated no questions asked.,4,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",1/18/19,2019,1,18
The Empire,The benefits are good but the amount of work you do especially in graveyard shift it's not justify the pay you receive. You only get .50 cents more for working overnight. A social life is basically non-existent since you sleep most of the time just to be functional for the job. The clientele can range from pleasant to down right disciple scum. If they don't get there way they insist they see the manager over the smallest things. e.g A vacuum cleaner for the display model price since its the only one we have. Fun fact the display models are a penny because they don't work.,3,Current Employee,Inventory Associate/Cashier ,"New Castle, PA",1/18/19,2019,1,18
"Fast paced, hectic work environment","Working as a remodel crew member involved transitioning the store from its old style to the new one, while helping customers along the way. We had four sometimes five different managers at the store providing us with daily tasks. Sometimes one manager's request would conflict with another's and this created issues.

I made good friends at my locations,"My experience at Walmart was many years ago, so I am unsure if any of this still applies.

Chaotic Management,"Management did not handle their roles very well, some were very under qualified. The culture was not aligned, there were cliques and favoritism among scheduling and placement. Employees constantly complained, there were no praises from management or compensations.

I loved the fair environment there where everyone had the same opportunity._x000D__x000D_There was also a great amount of freedom of what you can offer the customers. It wasn't a scripted call center job. You could work with the customers on a case by case basis, so if you felt like something wasn't fair, or if you felt bad for someone, you could offer them more than usual.",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Draper, UT",1/18/19,2019,1,18

Fast  and challenging work environment,"When I first started with Walmart it was a company that challenged me to better and further myself for advancement with my career which I did. In 6 years I was promoted 3 times with a starting salary of $23,400 and a ending salary of $50,000. The company went through many changes in 2016 through 2018. The new changes put me in a position to do my job along with other mangers jobs with no opportunity for advancement.

Stressful,Working at Walmart is kind of crazy especially in nk ri where they dont seem to ever have enough cart pushers and you have to go out in the cold and push for a 2 hours or so. Most people that work at Walmart are old or with disability and cant push carts so it falls to couple of people to ho out every day to clean up the carts. between cart pushing and the customers you get exhausted I'd rather work at a lower key place_x000D__x000D_But overall the co-workers are amazing and fun even some of rhe csm are great,4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"North Kingstown, RI",1/18/19,2019,1,18

Fast paced environment,"A typical day at work is fast paced and there is always something to be done.  In working at Walmart, I learned customer service skills and how to multitask. The management was very unorganized, but despite the disorganization I was able to go in everyday with a positive  attitude to represent the company and the best way I could. The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with customers. This was enjoyable because I was the last face customers saw before leaving the store and small conversations to customers can go a  long way.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Hammond, IN",1/18/19,2019,1,18

Its All Right If You Can Deal With Drama,"In My Honest And Personal Opinion Wal-mart Is An Alright Place To Work, My Walmart Was Both Understaffed At Times And Overstaffed At Times And If You Stay In Your Lane Be Kind And Gracious To The Customers And Management, You Kept Your Hours. I Worked Nightshift So It Was Mostly Quiet At All Hours Of Working Only After 4 A.m. Things Started To Heat Up Between Day Time Management Coming In, And All The Day Time Workers. But Closing, In The End, It Was A Better Than Most ( For What You Do And The Requirements To Get The Job) A Good Paycheck And An Alright Time.",5,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Lady Lake, FL",1/17/19,2019,1,17

not a good work enviornment,"I loved my co workers and the management wasn't the worst but they really lacked communication and leadership, they played favorites a lot and it really shows.

Review,A typical day at work can become stressful but nothing I couldn't overcome. The years I have worked at Walmart I have learned patience and how to communicate with my customers. The hardest part of this job is the management team not recognizing some of the hard workers and how much we put into our job. Me personally I love every job I have simply because I enjoy working and being around different people.,4,Former Employee,"Cashier, Customer Service ","Greenville, MS 38701",1/17/19,2019,1,17
"Good company, mediocre management.","While the coworkers and the work was fine, managers were either lazy or incompetent.

IF you need money then apply,"As with most chain retail jobs, it isnt the best.  My store, if it was an isolated case, wasn't the best.  We had issues, inconsistently, with keeping managers on duty.  They are willing to work with you if there are issues, but you have to have PTO.  In the hospital? Doesn't matter.  Injured from an accident yesterday, doesn't matter. Management was about as useful as a potato when we need help on the floor.  Something about policy forbidding them from helping on the floor.  Everyone got along and did what needed to be done.  That is all that was positive about work their",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rocklin, CA",1/17/19,2019,1,17
"Not Mad, Just Disappointed","Unfortunately, I am very disappointed whenever I got hired back on to this location. I felt as if I was being blown off and often ignored whenever I voiced that I felt I was under-performing and was generally unhappy with what I was doing. I was told I would be worked with regarding position and schedule but never was, I enjoyed how quiet it was during the evening, but not much else. The hardest part of doing this job is the lack of time to get my assigned tasks completed. The management team is very nice and generally very coordinated, but that is about it. As for workplace culture, it's lively, and there's very little drama from what I know, so it's refreshing. I learned that overnight shifts are not for everyone and I have garnered a new respect for those that can do said shifts.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Maintenance Associate ,"Decatur, TX",1/17/19,2019,1,17
"Fun place to work, there are some ""buts""","Enjoyed working here as it was pretty fast paced and they were helpful in teaching and maintaining knowledge for the ever changing policies.

"It was a fun place to work, but repetitive",I enjoyed working at Walmart. The pay was good compared to other jobs in the area. The hours varied tremendously from.8 per week to 32 and I was part time. The discount wasn't that great. It only applies to certain items and was 10%.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Christiansburg, VA",1/17/19,2019,1,17
Provider for Many Years of My Life,"WalMart gave me 10 1/2 years of income, 5 1/2 for college & high school and then another 5 later on.  As an employee I felt more valued than as a mid level manager.  Retail is retail and the hours will always be bad/ fluctuating, especially as a manger.  The pay was pretty fair, but the treatment of mangers I do not think was.  Truth be told I didn't dot my i's and cross my t's as much, but part of that is the philosophy one of my mangers told me exists there:  give people more than they can achieve so they will get more done and not settle type of thing.  Essentially, you are given too much to do as management and not the time/ resources to get it done.  Fixed schedules for the employees by corporate prevented me to meet my customers needs.  No OT is understandable in the market, but hard not to do that if you aren't allowed enough hours for the department/ area you are in.  Strange thing is though, I thoroughly enjoyed the hard work and the working environment with all the people and customers around.  I enjoy taking care of people, be it associates or customers.  Management was nice overall and the associates were awesome, just too much to do to get done, which is part of what I liked/ enjoyed about it sometimes.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Houston, TX",1/17/19,2019,1,17

"I found the Walmart I worked at to have been fast-paced most of the time, understaffed, sometimes stressful.","The hardest part of this job was when we were understaffed and needing to help other departments with returning things to shelves. It was frustrating only due to being short-staffed and wanting to help progress the straightening out of products and without enough time or help. The most enjoyable part was working with good managers and staff who are fun, funny, caring, and team workers. Also fun was assisting the public with their purchases; even when there were customers who were not nice, it was still ok since majority of customers are good, regular people.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Salinas, CA",1/17/19,2019,1,17
Great company to work for. Great benefits. Good balance between work and personal life,I work for this company for almost 10 years and the benefits were awesome they had a lot of job opportunities. A lot of room for advancement and a lot of training if you needed and wanted. I learned a lot from this company. If you were having personal difficulties or life struggles this company was there for you financially an emotionally.

It's Walmart. Did you really think it was gonna be good?,"A typical day at walmart was me pushing a floor scrubber around the store for almost the entire shift, usually with a partner. Having a partner would have been nice if we could have chatted throughout the shift, but the scrubbing machines were to loud to talk over. Other nights were spent throwing all the cardboard from the overnight stalkers into the baler in the backroom. Having a partner for this would have been nice, but walmart will only have one person doing this task a night, which usually results in the rest of the maintenance crew scrambling to help them finish cardboard collection after every other task is complete. My manager was a very nice guy, but most of the others in my department were usually rude, and overall unlikable people. Nobody ever looked happy to me working there, and I could never recommend the job to anyone looking for workplace satisfaction, unless you were in management there, preferably a shift leader or general manager. The job is monotonous as can be, and I felt at all times expendable.",1,Former Employee,Maintenance Worker ,"Easton, PA",1/17/19,2019,1,17
Customer service job,"Working at Walmart is a pretty good way to improve teamwork and social skills. Stocking the freight is only a part of the job, the main focus is making sure the customer is satisfied with the experience. Often times, stockers will work in pairs or small groups to accomplish tasks that would be too difficult for one person. At times, customers will ask for help and having two workers present not only increases the odds that the customer will be helped, but it also allows one worker to keep working freight while the other helps the customer.",4,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Jackson, MI",1/17/19,2019,1,17
Great place to work,Working with Walmart was a great experience. They have alot of mangers who are willing to help you out if you get put on a project and need help. The hours are great.

Also, your work hours change about every week, which makes it hard to plan your personal life.I went home sick one day about half way through my work day, and got 1/2 a point because I got sick at work about half way through my work day, That didn't make sense to me, but their reason was, Walmart has to have a 0 tolerance policy with their employees. The 1 1/2 yrs I was with Walmart, I worked every weekin day the whole ti,e I was employeed with them except a day I asked off about a week earlier, in which the manager said I could have time off for my family reunion, but I was expected to come to work right after the reunion was over that day>",3,Former Employee,Hardware Associate ,"Plymouth, IN",1/16/19,2019,1,16

Horrible Management,"I absolutely loved working in the deli. I know almost every in and out of the place. I would continue to work here if not for the management. They didn’t give any of us the respect or thanks that we deserved. I’m not saying we acted privlidged, far from that. I would just prefer to not have a manager to talk to customers in front of us about how bad we do our jobs because of things we are not responsible for. Or just a simple, genuine thanks for us doing our job exceptionally. There were days when we only had two people to do a three or four person job, and still got berated for not being productive enough. It is such a shame that such a great company with such great benefits has such horrible management.

Absolutely Terrible,"The Management is awful and incompetent, they have no concern for their employees and are only interested in bringing in the largest profit. The work culture feels like something out of the cold war, as you have other employees actively spying on you while you eat to see if you say or do anything against policy. I have learn't absolutely nothing of value and the only thing I have gained from working at Walmart, was back issues because they provide nothing to protect their employees from injury.

Not the company I started working for nearly 17 years ago,Walmart has drastically changed over the past few years. I have felt for some time now that the company is getting further away for what's right for the associates.  As a manager the work life balance is no longer a focus.  As wages are reduced through the stores the hours that are put on salaried managers increases.  Far too often I've lost vacation days due to company needs and often have to work on scheduled days off.  During a work week it's often a struggle to get a full day off much less two and most shifts are twelve hour shifts.  I appreciate the training received by past management that have developed me into the manager I am today but feel that it is time for me to part ways with this company.,3,Current Employee,Co Manager ,"La Marque, TX",1/16/19,2019,1,16

Fun work place as far as other employees,It’s a great place to work as long as who ever in management likes you or isn’t sexist. Hardly ever switch shifts to accommodate you .

Trickle down effect from management to hourly worker,"I am looking for another position because of the fact they have so many issues from upper management to department managers to floor employees.

The associates I have worked with and have worked for are truly the most wonderful people I have known. Some have become like family to me. There were days that were busy and stressful but that is anywhere you work. The most challenging is when the customer is upset and there is little you can do to remedy the situation such as a product they wish to purchase is no longer available due to a recall or another circumstance.

"the company itself is gross, as we all know, but your specific experience can be very dependent on the quality of your managers","The Walmart culture that the actual company likes to push is awful. However, if you are blessed with good managers and coworkers in your little corner of your store, the work day can go fairly quickly because there’s a lot to do, and the pay is absolutely not bad at all. In my experience it was fairly easy to make sure people like you by simply trying a little bit and I genuinely liked a couple of my coworkers and most of the managers I worked closely with. The work was hard asf but once I got the hang of the rhythm I did not much mind it._x000D__x000D_This is a job that could be 1000% ruined by having a bad manager, however. My experience with the company was good primarily because my specific department managers were good. Like, they understood that if you’re clocking in at 4 am, sometimes you might end up late, and they didn’t mind that I am not the fastest worker in the west.

Great Advancement Opportunities,Walmart allows advancement based on work performance which allows you move up through the company. Walmart allows you to learn any position in the store and allows you to move around throughout the store to gain experience. Since it is retail be prepared to work various hours and shifts.

Expected way to much of 1 person for 3 departments.Plus having to get on registers when lines would back up. Enjoyed the job. Loved the challenge. This is another place who does not appreciate good, hard working, loyal workers. For some reason after time they become a threat in management eyes because they know their performance is lacking.

Mixed bag,"WalMart is a mixed bag.  Management was paid fair, but asked to work ridiculous hours, and nothing was ever done good enough so raises were hard to get.  Hourly associates aren't paid well at the entry level, but those positions are intended for those without a tertiary education.  The problem is that the individuals applying for those positions expect to make enough money to support a family and that is just not how it works.

And understand that people you are meant to train and manage, aren't people to do YOUR work while you go and talk with other managers doing the exact same thing, and claim every bit of credit til everyone keeps quitting, and the manager remains because they are a long time associate, and cannot do any wrong. And who wants to find a new mangager, tough job huh? Yeah. That's your job.

Advancement Oppurtunities,"Walmart offer great and quick advancment oppurtunities if you are willing to work for them. It seems hard to advance up into salaried management as an internal, because it relies on your Asm and the store manager backing your advancement. So they can stall and delay you accordingly.

Fun place to work,"Walmart ECommerce, the company tries to do fun things for employees and provides food during holidays and gives opportunity to work from home (if your numbers are good). There is opportunity for advancement, but it appears everyone wants the same job so I would say it is competitive.  While I worked for the company, I've seen many system issues (glitches) I understand people are behind everything that is input in the system but I feel like with Walmart being a billion dollar company things should be better and teams should be on top of glitches not having employees or customers waiting 3+ weeks for a ""fix"".",4,Current Employee,Senior Resolutions Specialist ,"Fort Worth, TX",1/14/19,2019,1,14

Nearing the five year mark..,"I can honestly say that each store is different. My first store was well managed and part of the community (as it was one of the few department stores in the county) and I feel the atmosphere was very acceptable. In that place the newer wages definitely helped cover the cost of living in that place, but in my new city it is not nearly enough. Management in this larger city does not care as much for their associates, the wages don't cover the difference in cost of living, and the stress is ridiculous. The worst part of all of it is that there doesn't seem to be much more coverage in this store despite the much larger traffic flow of customers. Add the flow to the poor management and I can't imagine any worker builds strong loyalty to the stores here. Back home I would have stayed late, taken extra shifts, done what I could to get our store where it needed to be. For all of us we needed to succeed. Here? No loyalty gained in six months.

Pay is decent, if you don't have a large family to support, benefits are better. I have a good schedule because I am a department manager, so I can't complain about that. Salary management is horrible! They are so worried about pleasing their bosses they don't try to run things in a way to please the customers. Things are constantly changing so you can't get use to any one ""rule"" for too long.

Stressful and Extremely Poor Management.,"I knew working for Wal-Mart would be awful, and I was right. Their training process is one of the worse I have ever experienced. Managers do not train you, other associates do. And they train you their way. Every way except the right way. Then you get in trouble for doing it wrong. They throw us into different departments, who all do things differently and expect you to know everything in an instant. I have only been working here for a little over a month, and found out today that a manager was gossiping to another associate about myself and another new hire, saying we're too slow. The scheduling is all over the place, and many days we're left with only a couple of people in each department. They don't care how many pallets you have, or how few associates are scheduled. When your manager finally decides to show up, they constantly ask why you aren't finished with your task already. They make you feel defeated and like your hard work is never good enough. My advice is, don't work Cap 1. If you have to, work Cap 2. They're more lenient on the Cap 2 associates. Even better advice, don't work there at all.",1,Current Employee,Fresh Cap One ,TX,1/10/19,2019,1,10

It’s good to get in where you fit in with managers,The work is not hard as long as you’re focused on going in and getting it done. The management and leads look out for what’s best for them to look like the ones who are calling all the shots and doing the most work. They care about their advancement and that only. If you get it the way of that then you become a target and not talking about a huge target! It’s best to stay to yourself and do your job and them some because you never know they may even get onto you for not doing more than your 110%. You can be the best everyday and for months on shine but as soon as you slow down even just a little they will begin to as what’s wrong and why aren’t you doing as much even if it’s atill above goal. To managment the goal is a suggestion and the ones who are doing the work fastest always have to catch the “team” up who are slacking and don’t get in trouble because they are on special projects for production.,3,Former Employee,Operator/Area Manager Assistant ,"Fort Worth, TX",1/9/19,2019,1,9

Fast paced jobs,Many positions available at walmart. Everything depends on location. You can have a great manager that truly cares about you or you could get someone who sees you as just another body. Some stores are like a family but others just let you figure it out for yourself.

Management only interested in sales, nothing more.  No enjoyable parts of job.  Decent benefits, though.  management neither gives nor seems to care about any opinions offered.  No flexibility regarding moving departments for any reason.  Company is profit-driven to the exclusivity of anything else.  Any personalization, in my department in any case, is not only not encouraged but is not really allowed at all.  Poor hours.  No allotment at all for sick days or emergency absences, and any personal issues must be worked out regarding days off.  Too much back-biting and backtalk from employees.  Not a pleasant place to work at all.  It seems any suggestions are made to be disagreeable to management in any case at all.  No room for growth at all.  Transfers to other departments not really considered.  Hours can be cut at anytime with revenue-loss considered sufficient reason for cuts.  No variety in scheduled tasks.  Helping customers is very limited to yes or no answers.  Domineering management, mostly.  No help in operating some equipment.  Ordering seems excessive in most consumer products, at least in my department.  Little or no conversation with other employees, even in same department, is frowned upon.

I love the customers and like taking care of them.  the customers are friends, family and strangers but Im a jack of all trades and the master of none so it makes for a busy day.  providing customer service is the only part of the job I like.  The only time im stress free at my place of employment is when I have to stay past 10pm when traffic is at a standstill.  this is when theres no one in the way of me and Im not in the way of the customer.  theres a 100 percent drop in the risk of an accident during this time I believe.",2,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,New York State,1/8/19,2019,1,8

Good Beginner Job,"I learned quite a bit from this job. I loved my coworkers here and we got along great. I used my discount card all the time. The hours were great for being part time. I was late (5-10 mins) quite often due to the distance from my house but surprisingly they never said a word about it. I have social anxiety and depression which makes my life kinda difficult but my CSMs took care of me when I needed to have a moment to calm down. It was made a little difficult to keep up with things with inconsistent information and changing rules. I did have the occasional customer who decided to go off on me as well. Having anxiety its really difficult to handle situations like that. I do like the fact that Walmart closed for Christmas Eve. You could never count on your lunch being on time. It would be super late to the point the store could get fined for you not taking it... Which then you get in trouble. That makes no sense since you were not allowed to abandon the cash register. Or too early. During my time here we also suffered the consequences of other cashiers who were just hired and stole from the cash registers. We used to be able to carry around a clear bag but after that they took that away and we were not allowed to carry anything. I just don't think its right for the whole team to be punished for others actions, especially if they were newbies. Toward the end of my time there I had to take medical leave. I got to a point I felt I could go back if I didnt lift anything too heavy. I called to let them know what the dr said and I was told I can not come back until I can lift the normal - more...",4,Former Employee,CASHIER ,"North Fort Myers, FL",1/8/19,2019,1,8

Good job if you can make friends,I actually liked my job there because it had decent hours that rarely fluctuate and the pay was alright for starting off but unless you make friends with management there’s very little chance of moving up also if you’re able to make it to a supervisor role you have no backup from upper management regardless of how poorly your associates are preforming they won’t allow you to correct the issue,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pensacola, FL",1/8/19,2019,1,8

But the thing was I was part time working 40+ and a full time student. Should hire as full time and give benefits to their hard workers. Not to mention at the time I was there the management was so toxic. Managers too worried about what their superiors would think of them that they mistreat their workers. Had so many people walk out from their job because of this. Another thing was that management would schedule you a random weekend off and then schedule you 10 days straight.

Manual Labor at a Fast Pace,"When I walked in for an interview, it took the managers 45 minutes to decide on who was going to interview me. This painted a very vivid picture of my future time at Walmart. The most difficult part of the day was getting up at 3 am for a 4 am shift. Your first 4 hours are going to be down stacking pallets (5-9) and placing items on the shelf (yes, this is every day). The next 4 hours of your shift are focused on pulling items out of the back and onto the sales floor. This is a simple job to do but doesn't challenge you to do more as they don't promote good employees at my location. I was never taught by my managers how to do anything and most of it came from a kind coworker. On top of this, the managers were hardly ever around and were somewhat passive when they were. One manager in particular ridiculed me in front of my coworkers for getting a 350 lb. pallet stuck in a hole in the backroom floor. This was not meant as a friendly taunt as the culture would have you believe, however. The only enjoyable part of the job was that everyone was given an hour lunch.

It is daunting on extremely busy days dealing with thousands of products and many customers. It is an okay job, and they say its better than many jobs in the store.

Walmart is a decent Retail job.,"Walmart is a great place to work for school and work balance. I recommend working there as a first job to understand a work field.

Some what decent place to work,Walmart is a fun and easy place to work at. On the down side their scheduling process is terrible.

If something falls out the sky and hit you on the head it’s a step 3 and it’s ALWAYS your fault. Walmart as a company are bullies. They bully associates; everyday your fighting for your job.

Good co-workers but a tough work environment,You're expected to finish so much with a smaller team that it makes it difficult to actually enjoy your job.

"Nice place to work, but with right management","My typical night working at Walmart was like any other night. Restock and clean up the area outside and inside the freezer. I learned that you've to be fast on breaking down the pallets with dairy products. They want us to be done with a pallet within 15 mins of it being out of the freezer. Can you image yourself breaking down a pallet that big and that fast to restock shelves like that within a 15 min time frame? The management was poor as it comes down to it. Some co-workers do as they please and the other just don't get any help within the department. Some teamwork in ""this"" Walmart. Way too much favoritism. Oh and let's not forget about being a student either. This Walmart definitely didn't care about your studies like that. Supposedly, all Walmarts are suppose to be considerate for those who're students or in college, not this one. The workplace culture is cool. Nothing to drastic from that. I think the hardest part of the job was getting the pallet done within 15 mins as big as they are and not to mention pulling that in and out to the floors. Also, dealing with going in and out of the freezer. That was rough and cause me to have a fever of 106. Thanks Walmart. Most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers. That's it.",5,Former Employee,Overnight Dairy Stocker / Customer Service ,"Fayetteville, NC",1/5/19,2019,1,5
Summary,My typical day at work starts out when I clock in and I go to the screens to see if there is any cars to work on. I have learned how to be very task-oriented. The management team is more focused on themselves than there associates. The workplace culture changes on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is the weather conditions.

Management was not terrible, they just seemed lazy and did not want to deal with the problems.  Although, there are a couple of very awesome managers that go out of their way to help as best they can. The most stressful part was trying to get everything done because if I could not I always ended staying over. I have had to quite a bit, once over 3 hours. There is no creative freedom and we have to follow cakes by the book which really annoyed customers. The people I worked with were just amazing in every way. I still talk to them and think highly of them all.

Enjoy What I do; but the Atmosphere has Got to Go!,"I am so thankful that I had some previous pharmacy retail experience before becoming employed at Walmart Pharmacy in Martinsville, VA.  The reason is that there is no set training involved in this Pharmacy at Walmart.   You have to learn as you go and even though if you ask for help...the other technicians help if needed but it's not all the time welcomed...it's like most of the time you are bothering them if you ask for help.  The Pharmacists on the other hand ....well let's just say you have to be there to believe.  I actually witness a Pharmacist going back and forth with a customer/patient about an issue with their medication...and instead of calming the customer/patient...this Pharmacist proceeded to edge the customer/patient on to the point the customer/patient was using profanity and the Pharmacist was making smart remarks, etc.   Even though this particular Pharmacy fills a very high volume of prescriptions daily....it has the highest number of turnovers for the pharmacy technicians.  My suggestion would be for any future pharmacy technicians.....would be demand you are trained properly (3 months and continuously checked on to make sure that you understand what you are doing completely with positiveness)  also that you develop great customer service skills.  It is not good when a customer/patient comes in and starts complaining about another pharmacy technician have a bad attitude and asking if they are like that everyday.  The atmosphere in this Pharmacy makes it hard to enjoy your position.  The training needs to be a positive experience and not someone seemingly exhausted - more...",2,Current Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Martinsville, VA",1/5/19,2019,1,5

Poor management and favoritism,Very very poor management. Hard workers get rode until they break and quit while the “slower” workers get by..

Just wow.,"I worked as a cart pusher for two months at the Crawfordsville, Indiana Walmart, and wow. I have never seen anything like it. They had 3 cart pushers in total for the whole time I was there, and I was shocked by how they hang you out to dry. I worked every weekend day from Friday-Sunday on shifts like 3:30-10:15 or 4:45-10:30 (both pm’s). I would have to work until 11 on school nights and I would have split days off. They expected you to clean and wipe the carts down as well as sweep the floors in the register area when obviously they had maintenance there to do that. You didn’t have time to catch your breath there since the CSM’s (customer see managers) would be up your bum either complaining how bad of a job you were doing or something else that you did wrong. I walked into my store managers office and asked her if they would hire another cart pusher and she said that I’m complaining too much and I need to vent somewhere else. The cashiers would yell at you for not helping them with carry outs when obviously you do not know if there is any or not. I couldn’t believe how easy Cap 2 had it off. They had 10 people putting up products each night and then they would walk around for 2 hours just messing around. I found my time there to be wasted and I should have never tried getting a job there. There was one time where an employee threatened to kill me and I had to call the police since the management wouldn’t. As a high school job or a job that you have to take, it wouldn’t be that bad.

Over the years, Walmart has helped me learn how to handle difficult situations and challenging tasks on my own. They have also provided me with the critical thinking skills needed in order to work alone when my colleagues are unavailable. The most rewarding part of working at Walmart is the regular customers.

Hours cut and no raises,"Everyone's hours have been cut where I work and they do not care about their employees. It's a nightmare and my hours are inconsistent at best. There's a lot of micromanaging and passing the buck that goes on, too. One day I work a full 8 hours and the next I work 7. Some days I start at 10AM, other days - I start at 1:45PM. NO RAISES!!! ALSO... NO holiday pay. I worked on Thanksgiving for straight pay, same with all the other holidays... just straight time. Horrible company to work for and does nothing for economy.",1,Current Employee,Maintenance Worker ,"Iron Mountain, MI",1/4/19,2019,1,4
Just an average job,"Each day was just about the same. We would unload a truck, either filled with pallets or boxes. Then we would either break down the pallets and stock what came off of them, or stock the boxes that just came out of the truck. This job taught me important customer service skills as well as quick problem solving. I thought the management was just okay, they had their pros, but also a lot of cons. Walmart was welcoming and tried to be helpful to their employees. The hardest part of the job was not the tasks, but the monotony.",3,Current Employee,CAP 2 Associate ,"Halifax, MA",1/4/19,2019,1,4

Environment,When I started years ago I LOVED to come to work developed a relationship with many customers and associates we had several store managers but this one in particular was less friendly never listened to your concerns and was very rude his favorite line was FIGURE IT OUT me being in the company for so many years I brushed it off cause everyone has thing going on although you shouldn’t bring your personal life to work it happened on a regular to me as well as others  so I branched out I love this company and i would definitely come back when he leaves,5,Current Employee,Dept.

Walmart isn’t a bad place to work,I was a cashier overnight so it really wasn’t much to do sometimes I even stocked depending on how slow it was . I wouldn’t mind working back there if I had a choice,4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Niagara Falls, NY",1/4/19,2019,1,4
Good,"A typical day was mostly being at the register and ringing up everyone items they are buying, cleaning my area, and sometimes cleaned other parts of the stores. Management was good most days. if you had a problem with another associate they handled it well and are mostly nice. Hardest part would be making some customers happy, the most enjoyable thing to me was meeting new people.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Fremont, NE",1/4/19,2019,1,4
very unfulfilling employment,I absolutely hated this job.  Walmart is not a good employer and I would never recommend anybody to work there.  Corporate environment is not good and they could care less about their employees.,1,Former Employee,Office Associate ,"Dubuque, IA",1/4/19,2019,1,4
Poor management team,"Upper management has been driving away good managers and good people through unrealistic production demands.  Managers constantly trying counterproductive new ideas in an effort to improve production.  For every one change that makes things better, there are five to ten changes for the worse that are usually abandoned after enough people quit, get fired or get hurt.",2,Current Employee,Maintenance Technician ,"Cheyenne, WY",1/4/19,2019,1,4
Different routes,Walmart taught me a lot.  If you work hard you can get promote quickly within the company.  One thing that I like is that there are many different routes you can take into management.  You can start off as a cashier and work up on either side of the store.  You can go the grocery route into management or even the general merchandise route into management.,5,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Newport News, VA",1/4/19,2019,1,4
Not the company it used to be,"Throughout my time with the company, I have seen it go from a family friendly-family oriented organization to where it is today.  Today, the company is all about making a buck, just like most other retail establishments.  The company makes it very hard to have work/life balance.  The pay for hourly associates has gotten better, and benefits are available to them, but the workload and what the company expects a person or team to get accomplished on a daily basis is ridiculous.  In the manager role, you no longer have the flexibility to make a decision that is good for the store unless it is part of the ""routine processes"" that the company expects you to follow. Managers are paid based on a 48 hour work week- if you're in management you can expect to put in at least 60 hours...more during the holidays.",4,Former Employee,STORE CO-MANAGER ,Alaska,1/4/19,2019,1,4

Decent place to work. Need to sacrifice family/personal time to advance.,"Pretty good company to work for. Lots of pressure for not much reward.  Yearly raises. Quarterly bonuses. Full health care. Good retirement benefits. Matching 401k to 6%, I think.",3,Current Employee,Support Manager ,"West Chester, OH",1/4/19,2019,1,4
Great! but the store managers...,"The associates are great! everyone is happy and nice and respectful of everyone and their time. But the Salaried members of management are horrible. only 1 of the 8 managers are actually respectful to the other hourly associates. and the salaried members are rude and disrespectful to the other workers and even the customers, most of the managers have horrible reviews from customers giving our Walmart store low reviews on services like Yelp. but this may be my store, and aside from the assistant managers above, everyone is amazing and nice. the work is simple and Walmart as a company to work for is great for a first job or just a job on the side",5,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cumming, GA",1/4/19,2019,1,4
Absolutely horrid management,One of the worst places I've worked at with some of the worst management out there. My coworkers were the only reason I didn't quit sooner.

Fine Place to work if your job doesn't have you on the sales floor all day,"Walmart was a great job while I worked there, although because there is no union there, management will be on your case all day even if you do everything perfectly. You learn quick here that over-exerting yourself is not the way to work here, I'd say the hardest part of the job was getting to work at 4 am and having to move really heavy pallets with aging pallet jacks and having to break up to 20 in under 2 hours with a small team was really stressful but it got done. Only work here if you enjoy the hard labor or dealing with Walmart's famous clientele.",4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"San Diego, CA",1/3/19,2019,1,3

I learned how to deal with customer's who weren't always so happy, and was able to have them leave satisfied.

Work,"A typical work day at Walmart, some workers like myself, get treated unfairly. The communication there is very poor. Although, I’ve become more organized with my time at Walmart.

"Amazing pay, TERRIBLE manager","The pay in the Walmart Pharmacy is extremely competitive for any pharmacy in Fayetteville, NC. The manager I had however was horrible. He created a horrible work environment, didn't know how to run the pharmacy and talked about employees to others. It was almost like a bullying type of environment.

Management Needs Work,"Working there for the amount of time I did, I didn't have one manager that knew and could follow policy or could treat their co-workers with respect. There needs to be better training on respecting others and better disciplinary acts for disrespectful actions.

Eventful and friendly,I did enjoy my job as a cashier I was able to make good work friends and my supervisors were very understanding of our work and day. The schedule was flexible as they did have set times preferred for me to show up I did have to explain again that I am a full time so they were able to fix my schedule or just say that I can come in at the times I am available even when the computer says different times. It is fun meeting different types of people when working the register and its easy to keep a smile on your face when you are talking to the customers to ease their stress a bit so that they are less likley to get upset for a bit of wait.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bluefield, VA 24605",1/3/19,2019,1,3

Wal-Mart,"While I loved the job atmosphere and working with new people an customers everyday; you can not have a full time position at their company unless you are a manager or work third shift unloading trucks.

Wouldn’t Recommend,"Employee morale was always low, but job advancement is practically guaranteed after a year there. Pay isn’t great, even for managers. They gave fulltime hours for stockers, but hire a million cashiers, so they don’t get fulltime benefits.

"Weird Policy, Okay Place.","I worked at walmart for a relatively short time. Let go not because of work performance but because of the companies policy on sick days.

Productive and Fast Paced,"A typical day at work is signing in at beginning of shift and start pulling in carts from parking lot to designated area in the store.  Helping customers if they need to load or unload something from their vehicle.  Working in inclement weather and being on your feet constantly.  I enjoy my job at Walmart however there is not a lot of room for advancement and I would like to try other job opportunities not only for the financial aspect but to work as a team and help others.  Hardest part of the job is being able to maneuver the carts around the vehicles and having people remember that the machine can only go so fast and that I will do what I can to not inconvenience them in any way.  I was hit by a car at work because the person did not look behind them when I was trying to load carts in the parking lot; I am fine but that is the hardest part of my job, safety at all times is the key.  The management at Walmart is great, they are friendly and like to help when they can.",4,Current Employee,Cart Pusher ,"York, PA",1/3/19,2019,1,3
Very stressful place to work,"Very clique-ish. Only way to move up and advance is to form alliances. Customer service is almost non-existant.

The Absolute WORST company to work for!!!!,"Poor Management that doesn’t care about their employees. They gave raises and then cut out hours to basically nothing. Always short staffed, from call offs. They don’t pay holiday time. They reward the lazy workers and punish the hard workers. Constantly changing the way you do things. One minute it is right the next it wrong. Managers talk down to you. Treat you like your a robot. Not aloud to have fun. Stay clear of this money grubbing  company! WORST JOB EVER!!",1,Current Employee,Production Associate ,"Zanesville, OH",1/3/19,2019,1,3
"Not great, but not completly horrible either.","After spending almost 10 years with the company in different positions I can say while it's not the worst company to work for, experiences can really vary store to store. When you have a good management team who works with the employees to meet goals it's usually a great store. Unfortunately in some situations the management team is rarely seen on the floor or they run in ""packs"" spending more time avoiding work than being productive. Good management teams will make or break the store. _x000D__x000D_Pay isn't horrible. Walmart will actually start you out above minimum wage in most states. They offer yearly pay raises based on performance. _x000D__x000D_Hours are often unpredictable. Dont count on getting 40 hours, even when you're full time, several times I've saw full time employees being scheduled 30 hours or less against their wishes. Dont count on getting 20 hours when your part time, depending on department they may work you 20 one week and 39 the next. _x000D__x000D_Walmart does offer insurance benefits to it's part time and full time employees. They also odder 401k and stock options. The insurance is actually very expensive and has very high deductibles compared to other companies that are on a smaller scale. In almost 10 years I've never participated in the health insurance because of how over priced it is. The 401k match is 100% up to a 6% contribution. _x000D__x000D__x000D_Overall it really is not a horrible company to be with.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Barbourville, KY",1/3/19,2019,1,3

Please hire more experienced management,"During my almost three year stay at Walmart I have seen quite a few managers come and go. Some of which have been wonderful while others have been nightmares. They exploit their power and make the lowly associates suffer for it. We are expected to break our backs working for them while they show us no gratitude or thanks very often. I will pass by a group of two or three managers just standing and talking, and they're doing nothing else and making them look very unprofessional.

Previously a Great Company,"Walmart was really great 12 years ago when I joined. Now, the company is so focused on technology that they've forgotten they employ 2.1 million people. The pay for hourly is poor, especially for how much work they are expected to do. As a salaried member of management, I had a lot of freedoms to get things done. The pay was alright for not having a college education but not nearly enough for the amount of hours I'm supposed to and expected to work. Market teams and home office are continuously cutting hours in stores to reduce operating cost, making it even more difficult to operate a business. I could go on, but it's honestly not worth the effort._x000D__x000D_Walmart is great for someone that does not have a family, doesn't mind long, grueling hours, laborious and tedious work and generally terrible management teams.

Stressful Chaotic,"Walmart is a very stressful chaotic place to work, poor communication and often cutthroat. Management is subject to upheaval  and change without notice.

A typical day is clocking in, and getting ready to serve our customers with the best customer service that we can was a good start. I learned a lot working in the deli from the other associates, and then I was able to learn more about the other areas of the store by picking up shifts, and then learning by watching as well. I will say that with the stores I have worked at, that management could have cared a little more about their employees then they have shown. But this is not every Walmart. I know some that have some really good management. The culture was not bad either. The hardest part of the job would be honestly trying to get management up to the deli where we worked, to come and assist when needed.The enjoyable part was having a great team of workers who enjoyed being around one another, and assisting customers with great experience.

Never a dull moment in a busy store,"From day to day, working at Walmart has its challenges. Whether it being the customers, supervisors, or even just a challenging task, it never is dull working at Walmart. Over the years, Walmart has helped me learn how to handle difficult situations and challenging tasks on my own. They have also provided me with the critical thinking skills needed in order to work alone when my colleagues are unavailable. The most rewarding part of working at Walmart is the regular customers. With working on watches, piercing ears, or even just cashiering, I have made relationships with a number of customers and having both the customers and the management team trusting me to provide consistent customer service every time.

It was an average oil and tire building the only difference was you were under paid. At the time it was 2014 before they raised the employees salery, but at the time you started out making $8.45 an hour. At other shops the average shop worker doing the same thing makes anywhere from $10.00-$12.00 starting out. Now I believe the starting pay is $10.00, but at the time it wasn't worth staying around.

It is okay for some,I think Walmart as a company isn't too bad. I worked with managers who were degrading and never did anything but complained about everything.

the summary,"The typical day at Walmart is processing and working freight. As a department manager, that is not the process but it is what we spend the first 3-4 hours doing. The management is wonderful individually but need some communication lessons as a collective. The hardest part of the job is doing beyond what is expected of us (without proper equipment most days) and not be appreciated for our work and efforts. Not speaking for all employees, but I do not need appreciation every single day, but at least more than twice a month.

Wal-Mart,"for a stepping stone job its good but overall I do not recommend working long term. They will rarely offer full time and Benefits are minimal at best. Management seems to play favorites over employees and is much more lenient with those employees compared to ones they prefer less. I Have been on both ends of this spectrum. They give the most minimal amount of hours they are able to in order to look good on a corporate savings level. Upper management can be very unhelpful when dealing with an upset customer and they will tell you that they need you to be firm with the store policy but will not back you up when a customer wants to talk to a higher level of management. Then you are at fault and you are the one who gets written up or talked to for not upholding company policy. Their ""mandatory"" meetings require you to clock in if your on your day off, which the meeting only lasts an hour at most. However, on your scheduled shift they require you to cut that hour of time making the hour you spent during your day off null. if you are premoted to a new position they do not take any time to train you on the duties and requirements of that position. For example I was promoted to department manager and my first day on the job I asked the store manager who is going to train me as far as job duties, ordering out of stock items and knowing when and what merchendise to put out in your department during the seasons. The reply I was given was ""Figure it out""",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Desk Associate ,"Vancouver, WA",1/1/19,2019,1,1

Wal-Mart,"I appreciated the fast pace environment , I like to stay busy. The scheduling was not good, I was scheduled for every weekend. and only one day off within a few day period. I prefer to work 12 hour shifts. The management was poor on the shift I was on and they talk down to the employees which is not an effective way to manage. Hardest part of the job is the management would not allow employees to complete a task before sending to another job task, so basically no task would be completed.

What they wont tell you about Walmart,"So this job is one with more cons than pros. First off the Management is poor at best. From my experience they are known for promises of good pay raises which turn out to be 30 cents a year, There benefits are not that great meaning you still pay a lot out of pocket for doctors appointments, prescriptions and what not anyways, They start you out with pay that would no way be able to keep you a float and there is no such thing as career advancement unless you are ""buddy buddy"" with the manager. The only thing i had to look forward to when i was employed was: the co-workers who were not favored by the managers were nice to talk to and always willing to help if needed, they do offer a discount card although its a poor pay raise you are still guaranteed a pay raise every year.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Coventry, RI",1/1/19,2019,1,1

There are many improvements that need to be made,"It's difficult to follow company policies in regards to returns, customer service, price overrides, etc. It depends on which manager an associate locates and what they allow to make customers happy. Many times it feels like rules are made up as they go along, rather than stick to a set routine. _x000D_One manager can have an associate working on a certain task, then another manager will pull them to work on something else. Then another manager will have you do yet another project! Then the associate is asked why none of the three or more tasks given weren't finished. _x000D_ Wal-Mart needs to not be so top heavy with management. Associates shouldn't be made to feel like they are doing the jobs of more that one person during their shift. The new Customer First Scheduling system is not family friendly. Many associates have children and need to schedule childcare. Example: how can an associate scheduled from 8 am to 5 pm one day then have a 3 pm to 12 am the next?

nice place to work,I work 3rd shift where there are not many customers. I enjoyed being able to stock and help around the store in other areas or departments. I worked in hardware and motor section. At times I worked in sporting goods and lawn and garden. I learned to be ready for any challenge that may arise. My manager was awesome. I enjoyed the people I worked with.

Not what It Use to Be,"I worked here in the early 90's and again in recent years and it changed tremendously, the fact that I went back a few times lets you know it was a pleasant place to work at one point. However, a lot changed....  everything but the building.Upon my return, there were few people I still recognized thus, management was another story. Just a bunch gossipy people that talked about people while hiring new people, there were disgruntled employees coming in and out, and a lot of people leaving as I was coming in. In additions to that there was a lot of turnover in different departments at this particular place. While working here, scheduling issues, and breaks became a problem, due to the lack of people on shifts. In order to not be penalized for not taking your breaks,(because that is required now) you had to simply TAKE them at times so  to be timed out on the  cash register because no one would come to relieve you. _x000D__x000D_Why is that an issue well, if the register times you out, 3times, you will receive a warning more than 3 write up if keeps happening your pay is docked after that you are in jeopardy of loosing your job so you have to clock out when the register tells you it is time to take a break or time to take your lunch. _x000D__x000D_There were a lot of clicks, meaning some CSM gave certain cashiers more privileges than others, which caused discourse between customer service managers and cashiers.To be honest, I use to love this place I always went back to the same one I started at because it was like family to me._x000D__x000D_However things change, rules change, as well as management and people. - more...",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Pleasanton, CA",12/29/18,2018,12,29

Varies,"I know not all management is the same as I had, but it seemed like the management didn't care about their employee's.. One minute they say overtime is allowed and another minute they say it is not allowed. There were a lot of people that needed the 40 hours and it seemed like to the management that they didn't care about that. Whatever time you were scheduled to go home, you had to leave at that time. If you didn't, they would get upset at you because you were not leaving the time you were supposed too. There were times when I needed the 40 hours and I would stay overtime if I needed too, but management wouldn't allow that._x000D__x000D_In my opinion, to me it seemed like management doesn't care about their employees and if they need the 40 hours or not, all they care about is making money. I can't say the same for every Walmart (although that's what it seems like) but maybe there are some Walmart's that do care about their employee's. Every Walmart is different it seems like, but if the Walmart I worked at cared about their employee's and would continue allowing the 40 hours, then maybe I would have continued staying there and working for them. And also if they had let them work more then $12 a hour I might have stayed.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"American Fork, UT",12/29/18,2018,12,29

Lazy managers and choosing what rules to follow,"Usually go in to morning staff leaving majority of the work undone, managers will blame you after you clock in. If something doesnt look right they chastise you even if they dont know what your department works like. Managers act superior in every way just because they're managers and the store manager ignores it like its not an issue that everyone hates half of the managers only because they act entitled. The managers will fire you behind your actual managers back for something that is meant to be a write up like call outs being 1 over and make you feel like your nothing. They'll then rehire someone who called out 24 times in the same amount of time but say no to you. Also if they feel like it they won't give you a bonus.

Great Company To Work For,"A lot of information that has come out about Walmart is simply untrue as it is a very good company to work for with a ton of career advancement opportunities. If you put your nose to the books and be your best self, you will go as far as you want to go within the company. I started out as an Overnight stocker and worked my way up to becoming a Co-Manager. The workplace culture can be negative if you let yourself fall into that category. It is mostly positive and there were positive days almost every day I worked there but some beat you down a little bit around the holidays and special events. Being positive and working through it was always relieving at the end of the season as you felt accomplished and ready for anything. I enjoyed teaching and training associates to watch them be their best selves and continue to advance their careers. Hardest part of the job as a manager was the schedule. I understand it is so that all associates on different shifts can see you and work with you, but personally I like more of a routine and a consistent schedule of the same hours every day. I really do not have anything negative to say about the company.",5,Former Employee,Co-Manager ,"Lima, OH",12/28/18,2018,12,28

Management was lazy when we needed to assist a customer by opening a security room door that would take nearly 20+ mins to open so we could help the customer when they were sitting in the office about 20ft away.

As a contract employee.... life sucks.,"I think Walmart is a good company with the potential to be great. However, I think they spend too much time ""restructuring"" and hiring/firing employees and contract employees. _x000D_As a result they are losing the human element and the loyalty they could gain by eliminating, or reducing the fear of the lack of job security. _x000D__x000D_Employees are much more open, honest, loyal and harder working when they have little or no fear of being let go. It's difficult for employees to pour their heart and soul into a company and their work when the fear of being let go constantly looms over their head. _x000D__x000D_Fearless employees speak their minds, affect positive change and growth. Employees afraid of losing their job, tow the line, keep quiet and will never move mountains. _x000D__x000D_If you want a company to progress, grow and be on the cutting edge you have to give employees a real voice and a real chance to fail and then improve. The constant restructuring and collapsing of departments not only cuts into employee moral it cuts into employee loyalty and their voice. Companies don't grow by the CEO and the presidents and VPs. They've done their time.

My hours only occasionally hit 40 per week. Most often I worked 32-36 hours a week. Sometimes, though, they dipped as low as 20-30. Over the past year that I was supposed to be ""full-time"" I've worked more weeks closer to 32 than 40. To make matters worse, they often gave me short shifts so I was working five days a week, but only getting part-time hours.

Last but not least the customer comes first and is always right. With management there could have been more who had better communication skills and better policies when it comes to employee absences and doctors excuses.

helpful,"i learned a great deal while working for Walmart, at first i wasn't sure i was going to stay there for very long but they listen and work with you around anything, i started off as a cashier and had any opportunity ahead of me, i moved on from there to become a sales associate and picked on quickly to the point where i was turned into a reliable asset. it wasn't long after i became a sales associate that i was offered a spot in management, but i respectfully declined as i was young and unaware at the time of what i wanted for the future. They understood this but kept me in mind for future opportunities of advancement. a year later however i accepted the department manager position over dairy to soon after also accept the manager position over frozen while it had a vacancy. i handled it rather well even with a small team.

Can't say too much,"More often than not we already knew what we were doing on Maintenance when we came in so it was just a get up and go after the meeting. you'd make sure to do the undersweep before first break, after first break the customers would be out of the store and we'd go about the task we were assigned until the end of the night. If we finished our task we would usually check in with everyone else to see if they needed help getting things done and if they did then we'd work with them to get it all done before the last hour when the store opens. during the last hour we would do safety sweeps and make sure the store is in good order before clocking out on time.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance Associate ,"Leicester, MA",12/19/18,2018,12,19

Generally the supervisors are  not good at their job and dont do much to help but bark orders and stand around. Its all ways under staffed for my department and you have to do the work of two people some times you might have to run the whole area you cover alone.

"Productive fast paste job, i enjoyed my time at Walmart.","My shift was set to 1-10 five days a week. I would go straight to the back room and set up pallets with a team of 6-9 people. Unloading trucks was the next thing we would all do as a team . After trucks are done everyone is sent to a zone to stock the live freight. Best part of the job was the bond I had with the team, we really did become a family in that backroom. The hardest part of the job was getting all the managers demands done on top of getting our own work done .
