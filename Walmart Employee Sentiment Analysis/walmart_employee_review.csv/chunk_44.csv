"Great management, great coworkers, never a dull moment","If you have a self-motivated personality, an eye for detail, and are great with people, the job is great. Some stores don't seem to manage the Deli so you must be able to ""find your own fun"" by cleaning and preparing cooked food while not assisting customers.",5,Former Employee,Deli Sales Associate ,"Mankato, MN",4/11/12,2012,4,11

Good place to work,"Unloading merchandise trucks and assisting customersI learned alot about how the sales floor and back room are runThe management team was ok, but there was a lack of communicationCo-workers were friendlyDealing with the daily work loadWorking hard from clock-in to clock-out",3,Former Employee,Inventory Management Supervisor ,"Streetsboro, OH",4/11/12,2012,4,11
OKay,I worked at night time from 10pm til 7am.we start out by having a meeting before work everyday to tell us the numbers of production on stock.we then go to work and start pulling the items that need to be stocked to our aisles.then cut the packages with a box cutter to get to the items and simply stock them on the correct shelves and in a nice and timely manner.,3,Former Employee,Inventory Associate ,"Jacksonville, FL",4/11/12,2012,4,11
this job was very productive and easy going.,"Even though it was a very busy enviroment. it was a positive atmosphere. faced the department, pulled merchandise from that had been found in other departments or returned and would place them back on the shelves unless they had a defect then would label them and put them in a spacific place for them in the back. Assisted customers. worked with others when a display had to go up and worked well together. stood in for front registers (the main ones in front)",4,Former Employee,sales rep ,"Houston, TX",4/11/12,2012,4,11
A Great Place to Learn Customer service,"After working at Wal-Mart for over seven years, I have learned to do many things and how to be flexible in having to learn more things. I work in the tire and lube center where I deal with stocking shelves, ordering products, handling customers that are coming in to having service done to their cars, and check people out after they are done shopping.I do enjoy my job and the people that I work with or have worked with over the years. I try to learn things from everyone I work with. I help other areas in customer service, usally after I get my counters clear of customers. The hardest part of the job is the when there are not enough people to help customers. Even though it seems like a never ending job, my favorite part is making sure the shelves are stocked, the back room is clean, and my customers are happy and wanting to come back.",5,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,Benton IL,4/11/12,2012,4,11

Good Place to work,"dependable job, and a chance to grow within the company. Working as a pharmacy technician I have learned to always pay attention to details, multitask, and learn fast. I love helping the customers and making sure they are satisfied with my service. It can get stressful at times but I don't let that get to me because mistakes are absolutely not allowed in this line of work.I love working with others, and I am very much a team player.

There was absolutely no fun on that job.,A typical day at work was stocking shelves at a fast paceLearned TELZON and Baler to recycle boxes.Management was terrible.Co-workers were great.The hardest part of the job was working like 2 people for one pay check. Also working for managers bonus. When it came time for our quarterly bonuses there were too many excuses why we weren't getting one but management always got theirs. The system is set up for associates to support manager bonuses. Meanwhile they side step our bonuses.The most enjoyable part of the job was punching out at 6:30 when it was time to leave.,2,Former Employee,Dairy Associate ,"Monaca, PA",4/11/12,2012,4,11

Fast moving enviroment,"Typical day was about 9 hours with a 1 hour lunch.I learned different bagging techniques.Management was okay, they could have been more friendly and envolved.The hardest part of the job was dealing with unfriendly customers.The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast enviroment.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Indianapolis, IN",4/11/12,2012,4,11
Great associates.,There is no communication with management and associates.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"La Mesa, CA",4/11/12,2012,4,11
Fun at times poor management,Typical day is fun I come in and do my given tasks pull out overstock from different depts in the store that has available space on the shelves for the stockers to put out. By the end of the day I have to prep overstock and place in the steel by dept. I've learned that my job is an important part in customer satisfaction. If I do not properly track inventory in the backroom then there could possibly be an item available for the customer that is not pushed out to the floor. Overall management is bad that is what make the job not as good as it could be. The co-workers are great the energy in the store between all the employees are great. The hardest part of my job is when the stockers miss certain items and bring them back as overstock. It is my responsibility to stop what I am doing to go stock that item as well as know the places they go and be able to judge if it can go out or not. I enjoy most the co-workers they have became a family away from my family at home.,3,Former Employee,"Cashier, Stocker, Inventory Assoc ","Canton, MI",4/11/12,2012,4,11

"A Great Place, Hard Working, but Low Pay and Low Recognition.","I have fun working at wal-mart, but the managers do not appreciate the work given, as well as, promising certain benefits and never recieving them.

Great job for anyone,A typical day at work usually goes smoothly making the day enjoyable not only for yourself but the customers as well. You stay busy so your day is over before you know it. I learned that working in public with people is a lot more fun than working alone. The management at Wal-Mart are there when you need them and are as helpful as they can be. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you are part of something that helps your community and all the people in it.,4,Former Employee,"Sales Associate, Cashier ","Conway, AR",4/10/12,2012,4,10
"productive, but not always fun or tolerable","values off course, favoritism through the roof; do not look at peoples work after shift ends..they wait til morning. workers are often told one thing about their job assignments by one person, and another from another person whom resides over them. they do not enforce the need of workers upfront(some workers)& some workers throughout the rest of the store to take the correct amount of time for lunches and breaks and no more; when workers are swamped and their coworkers in their dept either called in or didnt show, they do not offer help. when front end has alot of people who call in to work; they do not fire them or hire people who will go in and work the days their schedualed unless a emergency prevents it. managers only see one side to a situation or conflict that arrives and if workers do not get their work done and explain why its not managers write them up or give them verbal write ups when they do not send people to look at workers work before or after shift ends. they'd rather look at work after done one day the next days morning like at 6am-7am for second shifters. managers and higher up workers think that even pregnant women should be able to do their job the pace the mngrs do; even if a pregnant woman has a complication pregnancy, and if a complication pregnancy woman does not get their job done; they get wrote up. i learned how to zone, how to use a gemeni, how to get items from the back to put them on shelves. i learned how to get pallets and work them; i learned how to re-set an isle with new items and or switch shelves, pegs & items. coworkers were sometimes nice - more...",2,Former Employee,toys sales associate ,"Derby, KS",4/10/12,2012,4,10
Rapid promotion!,"I started here as a cashier, and within 6 months was a CSM, I loved being a CSM I was always moving and keeping busy, my co-workers were amazing, and the customers were generally very nice people. I had a child and CSM hours did not work with being a single mom, so I steppped down to be the lead in the hard ware/ paint department, I always had great customers, and enjoyed the returning ones! The hardest part of this job was having to step down and lose my management position",3,Former Employee,Manager ,"Colorado Springs, CO",4/10/12,2012,4,10
Great while in college,"Wal-Mart gets a bad reputation these days for many reasons, but my experience working there for 2 years was ultimately very positive. Like any retail job, there are certainly pros and cons. The store I worked at had a good group of people, and management was overall very good. My supervisor(s) were generally very nice, and the store manager was also a cool guy as well.My experience there was predominately positive, however this required a lot of hard work and effort as well. People do get mistreated, but these people are generally the ones who are bumming off other people and not doing there work. Therefore, it seems to be justified. I would work 8 - 12 hour shifts. I started work pushing carts (at 8 dollars an hour), and by the time I left I was a cashier making 8.80. Not a lot of money by any stretch, but I was eligible for benefits within a year (working part time no less). The money is good enough for a college student, but I just couldn't imagine living off a salary like this (even working full time).I suppose that last point is the biggest negative. Wal-Mart could pay employees much more and still profit very well.As is expected from Wal-Mart, the hardest part is working with the customers who can often be irritating to say the least. Plus, understaffing is very common. I would push carts by myself for 9+ hour shifts frequently (even on the weekends when it is busiest). As a cashier, I would often be left on between 10 - 12 midnight by myself.The negatives do not outweigh the positives, but they are worth noting. They are also why I am avoiding retail for any future - more...",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,Pennsylvania,4/10/12,2012,4,10

A terrible place to work at,"Come in to work, clock in, arrive at my work station, if you get stuck on a task and need help for a customer you have to wait any where from 15-30 minutes for a CSM or another supervisor to show up and then have an attitude because now you wasted their valuable time in their eyes. Learned nothing at all except that in order to advance in the company you have to brown nose and suck up to even be considered to maybe get an advancement. Management is absolutely horrible, only self considerate individuals, and they treat you extremely terribly as well, no respect at all. The co-workers are the only people there that can relate to you and treat you with respect and compassion. Hardest part of the job is having to work at a company that treats you as horrible as they do and not being able to do anything about it. Most enjoyable part of the job, truthfully I can't say that I find anything enjoyable about this particular store that I worked at.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Naperville, IL",4/10/12,2012,4,10
Great place to work,Productive and friendly work environment throughout the store. The hardest part of my job is getting some individuals in the team spirit. The most enjoyable part of my job knowing I contributed in making a customer satisfied. Some of my co workers are friendly and customer focused at all times. Management is known to be fair and professional when handling employee work related issues.,4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Greer, SC",4/10/12,2012,4,10
A mediocre place to work.,"The managers and I didn't get along very well, and I will say I am an easy person to get along with. People just get power hungry sometimes. Other than that, I enjoyed it.

Retail,Come in and stock shelves. Assist customers. Learned to be a leader and show by example. Management always changed. Co-workers were nice.

Love the job hands down,Opening up the bakery making donuts for the sales floor then moving over to the deli to start setup for the day.More customer service addition experience with using a slicer and making donuts as well as doing things out on the sales floor. I love management in the begin but there were so many different changes through my time with them its really hard to rate management. Some of my co-workers were team players and some were not but never affected my job performance. there was nothing really to hard about the job but stocking the freezer. I loved that i stayed busy all the time it made my day go by so fast,4,Former Employee,Sales/Deli Associate ,"Conway, AR",4/10/12,2012,4,10
terrible,"You get out of your employees what you put into them.

Great company/bad scheduling and etc,"Mentoring was the best,and working with great associates and customers. I didn't like to much of the training program for manager. Didn't teach you enough,and not enough team work from upper managing superviors. Love the company, but not so much who they choose to help run some of the stores. Also as a family store they did treat some of their associates and manager as family.

You try to find full time work because you need to take care of family and yourself. I couldn't get a full time job after working for over 2 years part time because I was going to school full time.

Brutal working conditions for low wages.",1,Former Employee,Pharmacy/Customer Service Associate ,"De Pere, WI",4/10/12,2012,4,10
Walmart is not the place for me,"A typical day requires unloading delivery truck, breaking down pallets of frozen merchandise and placing the merchandiser on store shelves inside freezers. The hardest part of the job is getting everyone on the same page and feeling like a team. Managers are always stating that teamwork can get alot done but that is not what I see nor feel. There is no teamwork in Walmart, it is eveyone man and woman for themselves.I've been working for Walmart for about a month and I have learned that when I am at work I am surrounded by negativity from employees to managers. I am an overnight associate and if I was a manager for Walmart I would not be afraid to get dirty with my employees. Meaning when it's crunch time and my employees fall behind, I am right there helping them out.

My managers are always running back and forth dealing with other associates and customers so sometimes I would have to manage the front end while one of my co-workers would go to the service desk and do my job.

Great business to work for during college years.,"A typical day at Wal-Mart can be sometimes exciting and sometimes stressful. Working with the public you come in contact with many people some loyal and many rude...a positive mind frame and respectful attitude will get you through any situation at Wally World :). The management team at Wal-Mart seems a little stressful, if the position is for you, you can survive.

Productive and Busy Days,"A typical day at work as a department manager would be completing price changes, modulars, and customer service. I learned how to set modulars quickly and effectively. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping a customer find an item they are looking for and knowing they were satisfied. The hardest part of my job is when management would require many tasks to be completed and knowing which ones needed to be completed right away and which could wait, I have to pioritize each day and ensure the most important tasks are completed.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Geneva, NY",4/9/12,2012,4,9

Unhappy,"My assistant manager was a nice person, however....you couldn'ttalk to her at all about work. Every time I went to her with a question or a work related issue...she would interupt me & start talking about her personal life and/or problems. Its VERY difficult to solve any problems or follow through with anything with her. A question that will take a minute or two to answer or discuss turns into a 5 or 10 minute venting session (on her part). I understand that when you work with people for 40 hours a week, you discuss personal things with them from time to time. But there IS a time and a place and in the middle of a work related conversation is neither the time or the place. I wonder how she manages to get her own work down. Let alone help us with ours ??? WalMart has taken a turn for the worse.Maybe someday it will return to the way it used to be. Now profit is their only concern....NOT their associates or customers. They are heartless.",1,Former Employee,ICS ,"North West, NJ",4/9/12,2012,4,9

In other words, there were some managers who really cared about the work climate and environment; however, there were other who seemed that they were there to only earn a pay check. I truly enjoyed working with my co-workers, becuase we pulled together and worked as a team. We learned from each other and took advice from each other in accomplishing our goals.

"Found Out Working For Wal-Mart, Company Profits Are Foremost...Associates & Customers DEAD Last!!!","Working For ""Wally-World"" Had Always Been A Dream Job Of Mine Even In My days of Primary Education. So Believe Me, 19 Years Later When I Actually Got My Chance At Working For Wal-Mart I Was Totally 900% Ecstatic. However Within The First Couple Of Days, My Zealous Enthusiasm Turned Into Horror. I was being Over-Worked When The ""Other"" Co-Workers CHOSE ""Not"" To Show-Up For Work. Oh Yeah Sure, Those 1st Several Weeks I Was Making ""Great"" Money; And Being ""Patted-On-The-Back"" For All Of My Hard Labor. Notwithstanding Though As The Weeks Turned Into Months, And Then To Years -- I Seen How My Dedication/Hard Labor Was Being ""TOTALLY"" Taken Advantage Of. I'd come home dead-Tired, And Then Berated The Next Day For ""Needing"" To Pick-Up My Pace. So That My Co-Workers Wouldn't Have So Much Work To Do, When They Came In.However The Final Insult To Injury, Was When I Begin Having Health Issues Because Of Over-Working Myself And Then Being ""Targeted"" By My Other Co-Workers[Being Left Alone With A Ton Of Work Needed To Be Done In A Short Time]. So That The Managers Could Find Faults In My Work. To Me Having To ""Break Safety Rules"" Because You're Having To Over-Do-It; Just To Stay Caught Up Is Ridiculous. Long Story Short, I'd Not Recommend Wal-Mart To Anyone.",1,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate/Customer Service Representative ,"Enterprise, AL",4/5/12,2012,4,5

Managers are so concerned about gossip and who they can get even with or who can have the most friends that they fail to see the big picture. When I go into another WalMart to shop, as a customers the service is poor too. I see how manager's handle customer concerns and complaints, and it is poor at best.

Depending on whether it was a holiday or not , or if the store had been ran sacked because of a hurricane dictated the outcome. I would pull all the pallets out from the grocery side for each aisle usually would have somebody help me. Then would drop all the merchandise on the floor where it goes including all of the gm freight that came into the grocery side. Depending on the aisle on how it looked would usually determine how much backstock I would pull out. If the aisle wasn't so bad and the amount of grocery that came in for that night maybe just try to find all the lows and outs. After I got my team set with that I would go around and look at all the displays, front main displays, side displays and skids for each aisle and determine whether I would have to tear them down and rotate them to smaller displays or fill them up. At 3 in the morning I usually would receive a dairy, frozen, or charts (sales items for the week) truck and would unload it. At around 4:30 we would have to pick up shrink wrap all pallets going back and get them lifted into the racks so the backroom would look good.

Walmart as a place to work,Walmart in itself is not a bad place to work. The biggest draw back is that they put profits above their emplyees ability to accomplish basic tasks. They fail to adquately staff many departments and this creates an overburden on those in that department that work for very minimal pay.

My opinion of Walmart employer,"I had worked for Walmart super center store. It's a fun place to meet new people everyday; you get to work independently; you can choose the hours. But health insurance does not cover some needs like chiropractic services. Walmart is a good place for young people to work and support themselves through colleges. It's also good for disabled people to work part time and get to keep their SSDI benefits, too. Same for retired people to work there to supplement their retirement pension benefits. The pay is better for management level jobs. But the pay raise is only 35 cents to 60 cents for non-management level jobs. The best part about it is bonus surplus added to the paycheck if the store meets monthly profit goal every month. I would not mind to work part time for Walmart. If you want higher pay, bigger pay raise and better healh insurance coverage and especially retirement plan, it is better to seek jobs with other employers that can afford to give you more! It's okay to work for Walmart if you are looking for a part time job. That is all.",3,Former Employee,Instock Associate ,"Gilbert, AZ",3/31/12,2012,3,31

Stocking, rotating, inventory, all parts of the job that require your attention daily, you are never without something to do. I enjoyed working for my original department manager, she trained me for department head position.

"If you can work somewhere else, do it.","A typical day at Wal-Mart includes zoning the areas for which I am responsible and caring for clients. Management delegates duties which are to be performed and I do them. The moral is nothing to be desired as many are concerned with their lack of hours and low income. I feel the direct management does care about the day to day concerns of the employees but does not have the power to make changes, often making empty promises to the staff in terms of hours we will be given or policy changes to be implemented.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Oskaloosa, IA",3/31/12,2012,3,31

The hardest part of the job is listening to people complain about everything. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with.

An awful place to work if you have any goals in life.,"Granted, it is wonderful if you are part of the geriatric crowd or struggled to graduate from high school. For anyone who is looking for advancement in a career, go elsewhere. I'm not saying its impossible, and at some stores it happens rather quickly. I'm just saying at the Walmart I work at, in Moberly, you will not advance. You will only get the minimum raise available. You will not be recognized for hard work. On the plus side, if you've been there long enough, you won't be fired even if you call in repeatedly. I haven't figured out if it is because of nepotism or having to pay workman's comp, but they will not fire some associates no matter how worthless they are.

Brief Synapes,"Great place, but turnover is high at this time. No job is perfect and I don't think this is a perfect place either, however you will find that their are many workers who have been employed in the Walmart system many many years. This is because of the pay increase, benefits packages, and ability to transfer and relocate if you ever chose to move. The idea of maintaining competitiveness against other retailers without losing stock shares is really eating away at employee's overall happiness as work more for less is becoming more prominent throughout the global system. It is this, which makes the job the most difficult as turnover will continue to be a problem and increases in it occurring with new hires.",4,Current Employee,Inventory Control Specialist ,"Grapevine, TX",3/28/12,2012,3,28

good for part-time employment,Wal-mart only hires associates part time and you have to wait until another position opens up if you want to move or move up.

I was trusted to get the hard demanding jobs done comparing to my other co-workers based on expierence and work ethic. Co-workers were all different when it came to hard work/fast paste environments.

Opportunities for advancement for the right kind of person,"When leadership changes direction, you better hold on tight or run to keep up. The salary for most management positions is high compared to other jobs in this state. Just know that you'll be spending a lot more time at the office than with your family, and the dusty cubicles are far from cozy. Expect to go in early and leave late every single day. You'll spend countless hours in pointless meetings and hardly have time for lunch. Don't bother calling ISD when your laptop crashes. Just find the smartest guy in your department and beg for his help. Even if he's on vacation this week, it will still get done faster than going through ISD.You'll be expected to cheer at 7:30 during the Saturday morning meetings. You'll have a company phone attached to your hip at all times, and you'll be guaranteed never to work a standard 40-hour week. There are lots of opportunities to advance at Walmart if business is what drives you, but make sure that's really want you want in life and start looking for a backup plan anytime the CEO changes. You wouldn't be the first one they've ""involuntarily terminated"" after receiving 25 years of excellent evaluations.Some people seem truly happy there, and you may love it. I just think it's important to know what you're getting into on the front end.

Productive company,Walmart is an ok place to work for. Depending on the managment your under the company can be very productive. Walmart has good health and dental benefits that can still be used after the have left Walmart. It is hard to go to other positions such as assistant manager and co manager positions in Walmart. You get yearly raises depending on your progress in your position. If ou work an 8hr shift you get two 15min breaks and a 1hr lunch. An 5hr shift you get just one 15min shift and their are shifts that you have a 15min break and a 30min break.,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Pooler, GA",3/25/12,2012,3,25

Worst employer in the USA,"Management forces you to work off the clock and enjoys tripling/quadrupling/quintupling your work load without additional help. They enjoy putting employees into corners where they are forced to violate the companies imagionary policies, which management doesn't even uphold, and when they do so they are disiplined uncluding up to termination. Store managers like to put store assistant managers with no specific department experience in charge of that department. They will make you work 10 & 12 hour days and not pay for that overtime, instead they will deduct the overtime from your last day of that pay period, and still expect your job to be completed in the hour or two you worked that day. Absolutely no paid days off, company policy denies ALL hourly employes paid time off (including maternity pay), vacation time isn't allowed nor approved. The best part of the job is when you no longer work there.",1,Former Employee,Baker ,"Saline, MI",3/25/12,2012,3,25

Walmart Inc. Summary,"Beginning from damaged merchandise from main warehouse destroyed during shipping, to employees that simply work for a paycheck to managers that have better things to do than to minimize waste from theft and poor fifo rotation on the grocery side, A day at this company simply gives me heartache, Wamart could be so much better ! A strong company, it will be hard to bankrupt, but their in place systems need help. The store is dirty and in need of maintenance most employees have criminal backgrounds and show no interest, but at minimum wage is hard to hire an elite workforce. I have learned that when a company meets their financial goals some of the cost control and customer service falls apart. My location is one of the top sales locations in the US. The sales are from $300K to $1.5 million ( Daily Sales )",2,Current Employee,Receiving and Warehouse Associate ,"Osceola Parkway location Orlando, FL",3/24/12,2012,3,24

I was terminated from Wal Mart through a mistake on my part when applying for time off. I accept that and I am not a disgruntled ex employee.,"This was THE worst company that I have worked for. Not because of the company, but because of SOME of the management staff. Although my position was an overnight stocker and it could get pretty hectic at times there was nothing difficult about the job. I worked in the dry goods food dept. for the most part, but I worked all over the store as needed. We had a great team and we knew what had to be done, however, no matter how hard we worked, it was never enough and no matter how many trucks came, we always got our freight done. Most of the time, we finished early enough to help out in other areas. Still, it was never enough.I just had a very difficult time dealing with some of the management staff in how they treated the employees. It was as if just because we were stockers and they were management, we didn't have brains and couldn't make intelligent decisions. We were told the same thing every night (in my case it was for four years). Unless they were in a jam, then they were willing to listen to any and all input. I don't know what management pool Wal Mart hired their managers from, but the ones that I worked for were clueless especially when it came to the treatment of their associates.",2,Former Employee,RETAIL STOCKING ASSOCIATE ,"Gibsonton, FL",3/23/12,2012,3,23

Unfeeling Corporate Attitudes Towards Average Worker,"Walmart has a bad relations with its employees. High turnover rates; poor beginning wages which makes the majority of its employees reliant on welfare to survive; it takes a year to get some of your benefits and two years to get all of them; backstabbers and favoritism is more common than you know.Walmart is so busy being an equal opportunity employee that some individuals with particular needs (like single moms with small children) get overlooked because it's not a federally protected group like race or religion. Opportunities are taken away from single moms when they have to have weekends off, because the daycare isn't open and babysitters don't want to watch your kids on the weekend.I work with the most dedicated, hardworking, amazing group of people that make all of the issues in the first two paragraphs endurable.",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Show Low, AZ",3/22/12,2012,3,22

If you discuss something personal with management, they tell floor associates. Soon everyone knows. Don't trust any of them. Watch your back. Too much work for 1 person.

Poorly managed and little employee interest.,"My experience as a Wal-Mart employee was only somewhat good. The work itself to me was fine and I liked my coworkers, but I felt that the Wal-Mart I worked at was poorly managed. Also, I feel like they had little interest for the employees. They did not give you good benefits and expected you to work in different departments at once. Lastly, I was an apparel associate but was sometimes used as a cashier with no training, because they didnt want to hire enough cashiers. They never took the time to train me but expected me to know what to do. Those were very bad experiences for me. Their scheduling was also no good.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate and Phone Operator ,"Irving, TX",3/21/12,2012,3,21

Hope your not looking to make this a career.,Walmart used to be a place where you could get somewhere and be something. Now adays though its simply looking to suck the life out of you and move on to the next potential employee. Very rarely can you find management that isnt running scared of the suits and problems that need to be solved are often ignored hoping theyll go away. Also If your hoping to get a full time position you might as well forget about that idea. Walmart would rather suffer staffing shortages then promote or hire full time help to cover shifts.

Great place to work if you have a two incomes in your home,WalMart is a great place to work if you have two incomes and the other person has great medical benefits. I don't know if its because the economy but you are lucky if you get 12 hours a week. The workers are great once you get to know them. WalMart is all about their stocks and stock holders not about their employees.,2,Current Employee,"Cashier, Customer Assistant ","Modesto, CA",3/20/12,2012,3,20
Managers are always saying one thing and doing another can't count on them to back you up like they say they will.,I really enjoy working in this type of job it's what I do best.Walmart doesn't let you be your best because rules change from day to day one manager says you are doing a good job while the other asked why did you do it a certain way and tells you to change it and you explain the other manager says it was fine and he or she says to change it because he or she doesn't like it.,2,Former Employee,stocker ,"Austin, TX",3/20/12,2012,3,20

Attitude is everything,"Managers seem to think that because they are a ""manager"" they are better than you and do not have to do anything. There were very few managers that were willing to get out of the office and actually do more than walk around and deligate tasks to people. Even though that is part of their job, they could still help out more. When there was a customer who had an issue with something and a manager was paged to come to Customer Service or another place in the store, the manager would always call and see what the problem was instead of getting up and coming to meet the customer face to face and help them with their issue.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Clarksville, TN",3/20/12,2012,3,20

Lacking,"So, I have been working for this company for almost a year. I can't judge all Walmarts. But, this one seems to place zero value in thier employee's. There is little to recognition for hard work or effort. The promises made when coming into the company seem great. The truth is far diffrent. The inner working of managment in this particular Walmart are much like that of a high school. Performance isnt what gets you acknoledged or promoted. Popularity does. This is the main reason the current managment staff there fails at running a succesful store. There is a ever growing turnover rate for employees. Several factors have a part in that. A few major ones are low pay and part time hours for most employees. If they would pay more and give full time hour the employees they have would stay long term. Increasing the quality of service the customer get. this would lower the cost of training new employees and cause current employees to care about thier job. the store and quality of service they provide. Which in turn would increase sales.",3,Current Employee,"Electronics Sales Associate, ","Beech Grove, IN",3/20/12,2012,3,20

No time to Stop,Wal-Mart is pry one of the worst place that I have ever worked. All the employes are vary unhappy they hate their job and feel like they are slaves to their job and are treated realy bad by the management.

"Walmart is a go to work do your job, and leave type of place.","In my experience working at Walmart was a very proccessed area of work. I worked with older women that seemed to not like the idea of any competition especially from the younger generation. myself along with other and previous young employees had been harrassed, insulted, and told to complete taskeds in ways that were in fact wrong. This later lead to strikes against me and eventually termination.

Never again...,I started at Walmart in high school that's when the company was fun to work at. I started at the College Drive store then later ended my career there at the Denham Springs location. Some of the people there were fun to work with while others would go around harrassing you for no reason. I think Walmart is a great job for anyone needing part time work because they do not vaule family or they don't even try and help people that are students.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,Denham Springs,3/8/12,2012,3,8

Corporation grades are good but individual management needs work.,"I like everything about the company except the management. Some managers tend to bend the company's policies for their own success.

Ok Job... Every store is different with different mgmt and pay structures,"I was hired in 2008 at the Walmart in Richardson. It was the small grocery walmart. It was a very nice store. It was a ""test"" store with mostly an older and retired (or near retired) workforce working alongside young college students. I liked the job. It was laid back. Mgmt was cool. It had its little politics going on but nothing major. Child's play to me because I had worked in jobs with ""major"" political battles.Every store is drastically different with different management and pay structures. This store was like a small family type of store with the store manager personally taking an interest in making sure his employees were trained properly and treated well..Hard to come by that type of management. Walmart overrall is a pretty good company now. I guess they've been sued so much for everything ( I had read Walmart gets sued every day of the year) that they now pretty much know what's not allowed.Good job overrall. Crazy hours. Part time work. But ok.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service/Cashier ,"Richardson, Texas",3/7/12,2012,3,7

Working at wal-mart isn't a walk in the park but it is a overall good company.,"Working with customers can and will always be a pain in the rear sometimes, but over all the company tries to make it a great place to work. The store I work at is a small one and no one really is leaving because they have been there for 10 + years. So advancement isn't the easiest thing to do in that store.

the company has good core values but is drifting away from those.

Not horrible but not the best job either,The company is not horrible to work for. The work isn't hard at all and some of the people you meet working here are pretty nice. The management can be a pain simply because they dn't see what goes on on an hourly basis and they can create their own judgment simply from overhearing something. It doesn't help your job when you're being ridiculed about the bad things you do but not praised for the good things. That said management isn't all bad. I have become friends with a few of them and they are pretty cool people most of the time.

Yeah its Wal-Mart,"Its a job. Thats pretty much it. No room for growth unless your friends with people in higher places. Started in the toy department and expected to cover sporting goods and pets. Cutting keys and selling fishing licence involved most of the day as well as keeping the toy department from being cluttered. The toy department is one of the lowest paid areas in Wal-mart and I feel very offended to be required to work in higher paying departments and not be compensated. Most of the people who worked in sporting goods will stand behind the desk most of the day and twiddle thumbs while I was required to run back and forth all day zoning, pulling merchandise out the back, performing back up cashiering. Also had to cover lunch breaks for cart pushers and even spent some of my shifts doing nothing but cart pushing. I did not complain for an entire year and did the job to my fullest ability and in the end during my yearly evaluation was ""average"" with a petty 40 cent raise.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Florida,3/2/12,2012,3,2

Meh,Wal-mart isnt so bad for working for a summer job it is usually pretty easy to get on and the work isn't complicated. However staying there can be pretty tough especially now full time hours are hard to come by and the criteria for advancement is not static. How ever the customer service experience one gains by such a job can be useful. Having worked at multiple wal-mart stores in every one i have been in management is always very inconsistent be prepared to be tossed in with out any instruction and learn as you go and hopefully you have people to help but more often than not you are by yourself.,2,Former Employee,Meat Dept associate ,Meat Dept,3/2/12,2012,3,2
Not Recommended for long term employment,"My view of Walmart is negative. They had promised me full time, and then laid me off. Even though my job duties and review was positive.

Fun i guess,they make it hard for you to transfer out or to any other postions. They coach you like crazy if you want to leave your postions. They watch you to make sure you aren't stealing even when you are not. Pay is good but it isn't enough to cover rent or pay other bills. alot of people who work at walmart end up having two to three jobs. Policies are not quite followed. they make you work even though you are at the point of fainting. you can't even go home if you are sick unless you call in and that ends up on your records. People act like high schoolers there. best advice watch what you say because it will spread like wild fire at wal-mart. health care is too expensive.,2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Iowa, Iowa city",3/1/12,2012,3,1
Retail with corporate structure,"Working relationship good with coworkers.Human Resources Department reliable and supportive.Little communication with management.

Comfortable retail environment,"I worked in the Tire Lube & Express department for Wal-Mart. Thankfully, despite discrepencies with hiring me PT when they meant FT, my managers were adamant about making sure I got the hours and benefits of FT. I had to take away a star from cultures/values simply because of corporate's inability to re-hire me FT unless I was fired or quit, or got promoted, which was ridiculous considering it was a clerical error when I was hired anyway. However, I was treated with a lot of respect from my co-workers, and aside from transportation (I lived roughly 25 miles away) I had no problem working the hours into my schedule. I enjoyed helping the customer and working with them to determine how we could best fulfill their needs, and there was never any problems fixing any situation that arose.

"Nice place to work, part time.",Having had positions from cart pusher & maintenance all way to a salaried assistant manager I can say that their are some job codes that Walmart favors over others. Department managers are tasked with to many projects in a weeks time and pressured so much to get them done that they do not take the proper time to complete them which in turn could get them into trouble. Management is so far removed from the hourly associates they have lost perspective on what it really takes to be an effective department manager. Store managers flip out and even make threats to gilt you into pushing for sales increases to the point of nearly ignoring company policies and doing things to make them look good on paper. The family atmosphere left the company when Sam & Helen past away.,3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Kansas City, MO",2/23/12,2012,2,23

Varies on Store,"From what i`ve seen working at the walmart location that I do is walmart is a good company to work for, but the store I was generally hired on was a stop and go from the beginning. I was originally hired on for a certain position and then when I went in to do my interview I was then told by the Personnel Supervisor that I was to either be put into another position or I would not be able to work at WalMart Superstores. When originally I selected the position to better suit my Schedule due to parents medical problems. So, in turn I had to completely change my schedule for Walmart`s benefit. But, A job was a job, I took the position which I ended up enjoying in the end, but at the end I was transferred into a department I was completely unacknowledged on and was the only associate in that department for most of the day so it put me at a big disadvantage.

I learned how to b a team player and support my team members.,I learned a lot in a short period of time at Walmart that was to my benefit but I also learned that there are some companies that do not have fundamental respect for the people that work for them.

"Overworked, underpaid and under appreciated","Before we start I need to say that I quit and did not get fired so I am not spiteful towards the company because they fired me. The pay and benefits are bad. There are no merit raises, just annual raises. The highest raise you can get is 60 cents/year, but I only knew of 2 people getting that in the four years and three months of working there. Almost everyone gets a 40 cent raise. Management was a joke. Politics NOT performance is what determines who gets promoted. It is solely the store managers decision, and if you work third shift, he/she will not know you. There are no set hours and they expect you to revolve around wal-mart and expect you not to have a personal life. You can help them, but do not expect it in return if you need it. They cut hours for any reason (some full time down to 28 hr/week others no higher than 32 hr/wk and part time cut down to around 20 hr/wk), but you will have to work five days a week to get those hours because they give you four hour shifts and do not change it for you. They make you do anything that is needed (ex. push carts, cashier, clean toilets, work in frozen or dairy) no matter where you are supposed to work, and if it is a higher pay rate, you won't get paid that pay. I worked all shifts at Wal-Mart.

"This job had too much turnover, low expectations, I found myself not ""cultural in touch"".","The turnover was the biggest problem because there was many times where nobody could assist me on tasks involving more than one person. Poor morale also contributed to problems, although in the begininng morale wasn't a big issue. My supervisors really weren't that involved with me enough and I found that not really anybody in the store guided me enough to make my job easier.

Wal-Mart does not stand behind their supervisors.,The company overall can improve upon salary for those individuals who are certified and skilled in their craft.

"I was one of the ""Lucky"" ones","I was chosen because of my work ethics to travel and suppliment the traveling team of overnight stockers. This was the best job ever despite the management of the project itself. I really liked this job and the opportunities it presented me. the management however was weak, unorganized and just all around a bunch of jerks for no reason who would just wander the store and gripe. In my experience there is a difference between a manager and a leader. not all managers are leaders and vice versa. the pay was good for the work I did, but the management has something left to be desired. They have rather unrealistic expectation of thier employees and find new and improved ways to lower the moralle of the workforce. If the managers complimented the efforts of the crew and offered supplimetnal support or allowed the crew to work together to produce results, they might find themselves complaining less, in turn not have very much to do if they arent complaining.",3,Former Employee,"Overnight associate, blitz team,remodel ",Idaho,1/16/12,2012,1,16

Decent but not great employer.,"Walmart is a stable company, and can provide job security for a good employee. However, the work-life balance with this company is not desirable, as you must be available for any shift, which is subject to change week to week, and weekends are required. Additionally, all holidays other than Christmas day are required, and black out dates for vacation apply. They do give their employees more breaks than most employers, and promotion into lower supervisory positions is pretty easy to obtain. Walmart is a company that will require you to work in any other given position at any time. This can be both good and bad, as the experience in another position can help you become a more well-rounded employee, but the constant removal from your own duties causes you to be unable to complete work on time. No consistency between policy and enforcement of said policy by management.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Carrollton, TX",1/16/12,2012,1,16

"Although I worked with three different managers while I was at Sam's Club, they were very good to me.","I loved the friendliness of the people working at Sam's Club. There were always pleasant people to spend break times with and the company was always providing some type of benefit for us. Many times there would be free lunch and supper in the break room. They also provided a birthday cake once a month for those employees who had a birthday that month. I was given financial incentives I didn't even know about until I received my paycheck. There were programs where the employees voted for such things as employee of the month. My favorite manager was voted department manager of the year by his peers. We did have problems within the optical department; such as, the Texas/Mexico laboratories were not efficient. We had many remakes coming directly from the laboratories that we could not pass. I believe this to be one of the main reasons Sam's Club has problems keeping their managers and opticians. The manager's bonus is based on keeping a low remake level. Apparently, this is impossible under the current laboratories' proficiency levels.",4,Former Employee,Sam's Club Optical Department ,Licensed Dispensing Optician,11/9/11,2011,11,9

The manager showed us how to do it ""Exactly how they wanted it to be done"" So it was done to there standards. Same manager comes by the next day and starts complaining that it wasn't done right and rips the video games off the shelf and tell us to do it over again. Another example same manager. Some one had left a box of swiffer on the counter and in front of a customer also interrupting the employee helping the customer, the manager start yelling that the table need to always be cleaned and flings the box on to the floor and walks away.

So bad that I do not even like to go there now to grocery shop.I have done two separate stints at Wal-Mart; 2002-2004 and 2005-2007.During my first stint I worked as both a Bike Assembler and a Stockmen. This was my first job and of course I’m not sure what to expect. Being a bike assembler wasn’t bad at all; my coworkers were all cool and the work wasn’t too hard. You put the bikes together then put them out on the floor, simple enough. After a month or so I was told by a manager that I wasn’t really needed back there as they had guys called “Nuts & Bolts” that they could always call in to assemble bikes for them if needed. I was told that they wanted to move me to Stockmen.Now let’s pause right here – when I say Stockmen what comes to mind for you? Stocking the shelves or something along those lines correct? Of course, the name implies. This is what I thought when I was told the title but alas, I was wrong. A stockman is in fact the individual(s) you see out there gathering baskets in the parking lot. A more apt title would be cart pusher. Of course they don’t call it cart pusher because then no one would want the job. This job is about as awful as it sounds; people leave carts all over the place, there are many times where you don’t have enough help but are still expect to maintain the whole lot, weather (self explanatory), rude & lazy customers which goes back to the first point. All these combine to make the job of a cart pusher a pretty thankless - more...",3,Former Employee,Stockmen/Sales Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",5/11/11,2011,5,11

Not associate manager friendly.

Enjoyed growing with WalMart and having them as my 1st real job experience,"I enjoyed working at Wal Mart in Newton. I met a lot of interesting people, both associates and customers.

Productive business,I loved working for walmart because of the friendly atmosphere..It was home away from home.,5,Former Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,DELI DEPARTMENT,4/1/11,2011,4,1
Good place to work overall.,Walmart is a good place to work though in the past few years they have taken some of the benefits away from associates and it is a lot tougher to move up with the company. Very few employees are given the opportunity to start full time and so If you can accept part time work and the willingness to work hard and be productive you can advance with the company.,4,Former Employee,"Department Manager, Frozen Associate ","Humboldt, Tn",3/14/11,2011,3,14

No Smiles at Wal Mart,"I am an honest and dedicated person. I cannot say the same for the rest of my co-workers and managers.Here's a list of things I witness:-Someone smoking crack-Manager sleeping on top of old Lay Away counter-Co-Workers drunk with stolen store beers-Tagging in restroom stalls by co-workers-FightingThe day I gave my two week notice is the day I got Conveniently Terminated. Although, I told I was terminated, my records show I was not. This so called termination was just a rowdy mislead by an miserable assistant manager. After a year, I attempted to come back to work at Wal Mart, but was not able to, because I supposedly threaten to kill my manager. I never did such a thing, and in fact, she was terminated for stealing company money.I just want to work a honest job in peace!",1,Former Employee,"Overnight Maintenance and Stocker, Support Manager ",Baldwin Park,2/25/11,2011,2,25
