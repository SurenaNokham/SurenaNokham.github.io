The bad is the compensation. ,walmart is a hard place to work for compensation you receive. The bonuses are nice.

Absolutely Awful. ,"Working here should be your last option to pay bills, They won’t work with you, They do NOT care about your personal life or if your sick or not, The managers are on a power trip of some sort, completely disorganized, if you are having trouble don’t bother asking for help you won’t get any, understaffed to the point that cap 1 had 5 people instead of the 20 we actually need, constantly getting switched around and pulled, ZERO sense of time management. This was absolutely the worst place i have ever worked and would HIGHLY recommend you AVOID this job unless you have no choice. If you do apply, GOOD LUCK.

Easy to work for.,"A lot of people may disagree with me on this but I found it really easy to work for Walmart...

Bad Management/ Low Morale,"It is sad to say that the night management are not very professional.  The staff at night has been minimized and the work for those who are there has increased by 110 percent.  You don't expect recognition when you do a good job, but it is sad that as soon as you fall a little behind because you were given work that before two individuals had to complete at night and now one person has to do you are threaten with being fired.  The employees enter with a positive attitude but by the end of their shift they are frustrated and at times scared and anxious because you have an individual in charge that is rude, impolite, unprofessional, and worst of all the laziest person there.  What happened to those days when everyone worked together, your bosses came  by and said good job, and there was good morale.  Now it feels like they are trying to get rid of staff that has been there for a while to hire part time staff with less pay.  It is just so sad.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Fort Myers, FL",3/15/21,2021,3,15

Walmart stores are big. That's alot of walking and running which wears on the body. There's a lot of lifting bending and stretching. Is hard work.,"You need to be hard working, because you will work hard. You need to work smart not hard. They will push to get the work done and the store clean and in shape. They offer great benefits; like a choice of health insurances. Along with life insurance, dental. Vision, and all those accidental death etc. Is  also available. You can buy Walmart stock and invest in a 401 k. They offer short and long term disability for full time associates. There's quarterly bonuses too. Through 2020 the covid-19 they gave us stimulus bonus, plus they paid if we missed work for the virus. I don't know of another company that offers all that.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate I ,"Holland, OH",3/14/21,2021,3,14

It was the worse place I ever work at ,Terrible store. It always smell the place was always a mess nothing was clean. The workers there don’t do anything besides walk around an they don’t help anyone they aren’t coaching anyone even if they are not doing there job. The store manger needs to step up.

Its a good first job,"My time working in Walmart has been quite fun, I learned a lot from my coworkers and bosses. The only issue I see is that some of the managers like to make people's life annoying and they don't listen when issues arise.

Not accommodating to disability ,"I was hired with the understanding that they would work with me on my disability. I told them I would need to call out when I could not physically get out of bed and they said ok. After 6 weeks of working there they fired me because I had “too many points” even though all my points were because of my disability. I never called out because I didn’t want to go to work. All they see is numbers not people. They don’t go by a case by case basis, if they see you have too many points it doesn’t matter the reasons you’re fired.",2,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Niceville, FL",3/14/21,2021,3,14
Good opportunity to advance to full time and management,"rotate and stock perishable products all dayspending a lot of time in the freezerbending and stoopingclimbing a ladderhelping customersI learned that walmart offers ged help and assistance for employees in crisis. They do not offer help if you are homeless. They will not help you with your schedule once you are full time if something comes up. You can only get 5 points in 6 months or the system fires you. management does not communicate to each other and it makes you look really bad because of their failure to communicate. I often had a Deli Manager that has left the company use bad words at me because she was being yelled at by a previous store manager and the employees would yell at me if I relayed a message from management. It was overall stressful at some points during inventory and when the holidays rolled out patty label pies, but you get paid for your work and advanced if you can do the work and score competitive on the management tests. I think I would go back if I had the opportunity and my health would permit. The insurance benefits are good and at The neigborhood markets it is about the community and not 80 billion dollars a week like a super center. hardest part is getting all tasks done if you work alone",5,Former Employee,Associate ,"Athens, GA",3/14/21,2021,3,14

"Lies, uses you, seems backwards. ","They will lie to you while looking you straight in the face about anything, it seems more like the company and management cares more about how they look rather than how the employees or customers feels, they have 2nd shift (cap 2) doing everybody’s job, 2nd shift is the businesses part of the day and shouldn’t have a lot of responsibility, their primary focus should be the customers, then put out as much freight as fast as they can, then the rest falls on 3rd shift as they can put more out faster. Other than lies from management the people are nice. ",2,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Pikeville, KY",3/14/21,2021,3,14
CAP 2 was great,"Being the backbone of there store feels like you are important which gives a lot of propose.

Do not work at abingdon md walmart,"Management does not care about you or your breaks. They ALL talk about you to other employees. They do not give you your breaks at the required time of your break. Walmart HR she's alright. A typical day at work would be dealing with rude management and rude customers. When I first started working there they didn't give me my numbers I needed to work the register and then got mad at me because I didn't have numbers. Then I barely knew anything and put me in self checkout without any sort of proper training. All the older employees had to show me because management would be hiding in the front office or not with the cashiers up front. Basically they weren't leading the front of the store. All of the employees would have to plan out the breaks, figure out who was coming in, and when people were scheduled to leave. I got promoted to electronics and then went on vacation and then came back and I could no longer work in electronics. then when I had asked the COACH (which is higher than a team lead) of electronics he gave me a smart answer and then never talked to HR about it. I was also working back there and never got the pay that I was supposed too. I will never work for Walmart again. I also was told that they would work with my college schedule when I was hired on. Then I was told that they couldn't or possibly couldn't because they were too short staffed because they were firing people left and right without hiring other people first.

Very toxic environment,"I used to enjoy working here, and then once the pandemic hit, everything changed. While I was a cashier, everything was fine, but they began to pull people to work outside to count customers, offer masks to the ones without them, and hand out carts. It was fine that they were doing that until it began to be above 95°F outside. They had us standing outside for a full shift (typically 8 hours) in 100° or more weather. And we weren't allowed to stand inside. When it finally began to cool down, everything was fine, but then it became winter, and rather than allowing us to stand inside, yet again, they told us no, and if we were cold we should ""wear warmer clothes"" while I had already been wearing layers upon layers of clothes to keep warm.

Easy work,"A typical day for me at Walmart is checking out customers, covering others for breaks, cleaning a little and helping out where I can. Its not a bad job to work at and you can get good hours with doing little work and get a good check outcome. When I started, I was kind of nervous about not being able to remember how to work the register. I ended up remembering everything within my first 2 or 3 days of training.

I was able to break out of it and learn to communicate better I can thank Walmart for that opportunity.

When you report it to management, nothing is done about it.The store is a disaster and nothing is put on the shelves where it's supposed to be, making your job next to impossible to be done in a timely manner.There is an extremely high turnover rate at this store due to poor upper management. Many times you have to work through your breaks in order to hit the numbers they demand from you.Many employees call off frequently with no repercussions, making you have to not only do your job, but many other jobs while also trying to get your job done in a timely manner.

But the management is overall what made me leave. Management here is an absolutely horrific, chaotic, and unmoderated mess. Don't get me wrong, OGP was nice, when we weren't 5 HOURS behind on orders. And when I say 5 hours, I mean we had people in the parking lot waiting 5 hours for their groceries because they either weren't done being picked, We were too swamped with the inane inflow of other orders, or our manager had to stop us ever 5 seconds to lecture us about an incredibly minute because she thought micromanagement was the best form of management rather than actually being helpful and providing actual feedback. After sifting through 3 different previous managers, the last one was the final straw for me. If you work here, you probably won't feel valued by your management, but you certainly will by your coworkers.

They must be able to send on their feet for 4 hours at a time, an hour break then another 4 hours. Walmart is great because it keeps you busy. No its not socially engaging, but it is more work ethic building. By doing simple tasks you build a work ethic and better self esteem and you get paid. Walmart is a company to start or in-between jobs. Or seasonal. I'd work there seasonally, unless you're playing games and you're not serious about the company. I love Walmart because it helped me from being a lazy person and turned me into a person who listened to commands and follows directions, beyond being tired.

The worst part is probably the stress this job puts on your body. Every day I come home with feet that feel like they've been run over by a semi truck and my back not far off.

I enjoyed my job well enough for several years working with some truly fantastic people and excelling in my department. With the introduction of the ""greater workplace"" however, things have definitely taken a turn for the worse. There used to be consistency in scheduling as a department manager. I was able to plan life outside of work easier. The scheduling for the team lead position is truly all over the place and is never consistent. Openings, mids, closings your hours are everywhere. I feel like a glorified department manager with not much more pay than I had before but a ton of new responsibility. It wouldn't be so bad if management was better. In the eight years I've been with the company I've worked for good, decent, and terrible managers and am unfortunately working with the latter at the moment. The most positive thing I can say about Walmart is I am compisated well for where I live. I live in a small rural town and there is nowhere within 60 miles of me that pays close to what I make at Walmart. Another positive would definitely be the people you work with. I have met some incredible people the last eight years working here and formed friendships with some that will last a lifetime. Sure you'll have some that you'd rather never see again as with any job but generally the people that work here are truly great individuals.

Ethnicity ,I think its a good place to work as long as you come in do your work and go home. Alot ethnicity is great for all commumities Walmarts are located in. Walmarts thrives on employees being themselves as long as it in a positive way. I'm proof that promotions can be achieved.  Benefits are good  and Pto and Ppto make life easier to manage.

Poor management and doesn’t stick to avalibility whatsoever,"Coworkers and management would be speaking in English before I come up to them and then they’d switch to Spanish because they knew I didn’t understand. Management was absolutely terrible, worked me 37-39 hours a week when I stated I only wanted 20-25 hours. The manager of my department fledged my avalibility sheet to work me on days I was scheduled to have off. You don’t get any perks until working 90 days and then you get a whopping 10% off discount that usually isn’t taken. Don’t work here if you’re a student or can’t work all the time. They will walk all over you especially if you’re young. ",2,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Orlando, FL",3/9/21,2021,3,9

Your overworked in the sense that they expect you to help 30 people at once ALL day long and then punish you when you don’t and free moment get other tasks completed.

Loved my coworkers,"Worked at Walmart for almost 5 years. It took me 4 years to get full time and that's after they had people quit. I loved the co-workers but Management sucks. Decent pay I guess, not enough hours to go around in the deli, I always had to work somewhere else. Managers suck and write you up for anything. So yeah if you want good benefits but barely anytime off and might be fired for things you didn't do sure this is an awesome job.

Good transition job,I worked for Walmart information systems for a couple of years. I will state the pros and cons Pros:1. Big projects with huge ROI2. High maturity when it come to information systemsCons1. Pay is average or below even for IT Professionals. Consider the amount of out of pocket that you have to pay for healthcare2. Horrible health insurance. Walmart has catastrophic health insurance where alot of things are not covered. The premiums are not cheap.3. Alot of bad politics especially from management. 4. Expect to be laid off at anytime. Layoffs at headquarters happens very often for restructuring. The emotional stress is not worth it,1,Former Employee,Sr. Business Analyst ,"Bentonville, AR",3/9/21,2021,3,9

Very Physical Job Duties,"This job is a warehouse production job so it is very physically demanding and expect to be quick/fast paced with your job duties. You are on your feet at your designated position packing merchandise for shipping between 8 to 10hrs a day. Management is nice but hard to locate because they have to cover a huge warehouse. Only time you may see them around the area is if they have to give out ""occurrences"" which is equivalent to demerits/points that lead to discipline due to either not meeting the minimum amount of items packed in a certain timeframe (common), incorrect labels on boxes or being late/absent. Unfortunately that leaves a lot of employees feeling nervous and constantly looking over their shoulders.Co-Workers are very nice and are willing to help you as much as they can",3,Former Employee,Seasonal Warehouse Associate ,"Davenport, FL",3/9/21,2021,3,9
"Night and Day, the ups and downs of working one or the other. ","To start, I was given no formal training (partially due to the Covid chaos) I was given a blue vest after the interview and told to just do what I was asked to. After the week of ""just show up and clock in tomorrow"" I got my schedule, graveyard shift. Graveyard was nice since there were no customers, my team and I ended up being extremely effective due to this. Unfortunately, getting up at 8 pm and going to sleep at around noon is not great for one's social life. On the flip side, the short time I worked 4am - 1pm, I was able to have a relatively normal life, and most of the more area consuming tasks could be done before customers started arriving.  My Walmart experience at Walmart #2607 was not standard, my time helping out neighboring locations made me feel fortunate for the experience I had, despite its unconventional nature.",3,Former Employee,Backroom Associate ,"Polson, MT",3/9/21,2021,3,9

Digital personal shopper,"Ever since they changed the roles last year from ASM to team leads it’s been a disaster. The call outs are way worse than they ever were in the past and very poor moral. The people who do show up every day they’re scheduled get over worked and the team leads new mind sets they are instilled into them from day one “aren’t supposed to help, they are supposed to lead.” I say dictate but it’s a very stressful environment and the ones who come in are getting to the point of wanting to quit and move on. If Walmart continues to run their store like this - I don’t see a good future for Walmart.

There’s a lot to do not enough time and not enough staff,There’s a lot to do and not enough time and not enough staff One of the biggest issues here is the pay they do not pay any of their employees unless you’re on a corporate level what you were worth because corporate is more concerned with making money if you were here and decide to take a management position you were going to be taken advantage of and you’re going to be expected to work very hard and understand Productivity is everything get your job done and sometimes you only have three hours out of your eight hour shift to get it done because you get pulled everywhere else.,3,Current Employee,Front End Team Lead ,Walmart,3/8/21,2021,3,8

Steady job poorly ran company ,I always try to do a good job no matter what area I was in and it was super frustrating how these stores are ran. Like most stores there’s always way too much to do with how many hours the store is allowed. That’s if everyone shows up to work. They always assume that they are hiring really great employees that love their job and are super productive. That’s of course never the case so they try to run these store on bare minimum associates. Again in a perfect world sure maybe you could run a Walmart with so few but most are there to collect their check and go home. They just pull people constantly from area to area (whatever the biggest disaster is that day) meanwhile as they get pulled their areas get neglected and fall apart. Not to mention these people are out of their areas..they don’t care about doing a good job in someone else department so things get plugged or messed up and no accountability because so many go through these departments. Or maybe the crafts manager (who is probably on the other side stocking grocery) gets paged 4 times to cut fabric for the lady that’s been there for 25mins+ It’s all so ridiculous. That’s barely scratching the surface. ,1,Former Employee,OVERNIGHT RECEIVING MANAGER ,"North Attleboro, MA",3/8/21,2021,3,8

It’s like going back to middle school,"First, walking through the doors as an employee is hard to be proud of. About 99% of the employees don’t do their job, don’t care about the customer, and will not help a new hire. Orientation makes you feel like you are wanted and a part of a team, they make it seem as though Walmart is a family, a home away from home - it’s quite the opposite. Your coworkers do not care about you, and do not want to help you. There are cliques like middle school, and everyone is just obnoxious and loud. Your coworkers look at you like they are better than you, which just makes it an uncomfortable work environment. Just simple rules, like dress code, are completely ignored by just about every employee, management included. You could literally walk around lost in Walmart for your entire 8 hour shift, and no one would bat an eye.

"For how much the company and management makes, you would think they would value their hourly associates. Wrong.","I have worked at Walmart twice, unfortunately. The pay isn’t terrible, but they rarely make you full time, hold you to expectations that they will never be satisfied with, and allow customers to walk all over you. I worked in Apparel and OGP.",2,Former Employee,Hourly Associate ,"Joplin, MO",3/8/21,2021,3,8
Horrible company,"Such a horrible company to work for. They work you like a dog, and never are appreciative for you do.

"The only ""good"" thing were a few of my coworkers.","Walmart screwed me over from the start. I wasn't properly trained and then was just expected to know how to do things 100% properly. When I finally figured things out, thanks to some coworkers helping me, I was treated like garbage by management constantly. I was belittled and talked down to. I was treated like less than constantly. Then, I was fired for taking my health seriously during a pandemic, got rehired and moved to a department I never would have worked in if it was by choice, was no longer being scheduled and was eventually fired.",1,Former Employee,Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",3/8/21,2021,3,8
It was okay,Good job to start off at when you’re going to school. Some managers aren’t friendly and talk to you any kind of way. The job was okay I was only there temporarily.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Clovis, CA",3/8/21,2021,3,8
An honest review of nearly a decade,"Working for Walmart has changed greatly over the past eight years. When I first got hired, workflow was steady and not overbearing, and management worked with associates to help complete tasks and goals. But as time goes on, and companies adapt and change, Walmart took a turn for the worse. Between a bare-bones staffing, increasing workloads, and unhelpful management it became unbearable both physically and mentally to work there. Daily work essentially became putting on a dog and pony show to make the store look good, instead of addressing any of the issues. Instead of fixing problems, band aids upon band aids were placed on problems. All of this, along with the newest restructure of management positions, making every associate have managerial responsibilities without any type of corresponding pay increase, I would not recommend employment unless you are in extreme dire need of work.   ",2,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Philadelphia, PA",3/8/21,2021,3,8
Great Opportunity,Great company to work for. Challenging environments at time but the sky is the limit on what you can do. If you dedicate yourself and position yourself with the right leadership success will follow.,4,Current Employee,Asset Protection Manager ,"Bentonville, AR",3/8/21,2021,3,8

Probably the most demanding and unrewarding,"The managers were never there when you need them. If you needed to learn something, it was not covered in training and no one was around to teach you. The customers were the most entitled, slack jawed, idiotic and rude people I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. I do not know what it was about Walmart but nothing ever seemed clean, even if you just cleaned it. It was the weirdest popularity contest I have ever been apart of, rivaling high school.

Don’t get comfortable ,"Working here has been mentally and financially unstable. Customers are very rude and entitled then managers expect us to do their jobs when they’re “stressed” or we’re understaffed. I’ve always been a hard worker since the beginning but the lack of appreciation and employee favoritism belittles that!

One of the worst retail environments ever,"My time at Wal-Mart was the worst job I have ever had. All of my managers were incompetent, dispassionate, and highly played favorites. While I made OK money this was mostly due to the fact that I was in a very high cost of living area. Hours were long, and many weeks I had to cut hours at the end of my work week to ""make up"" for the over-time that I had accrued in earlier shifts. In some cases this caused me to miss whole shifts in which I was reprimanded for not showing up even though I was asked to leave for the day. May days I was asked by one manager to do a task then another would have me undo the whole process in the same shift. Communication was non-existent within shifts or across shifts.  ",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Odessa, TX",3/8/21,2021,3,8

One thing I don’t like is the rude strict manager at Walmart on central, so strict ! Also the 5 point meaning we can’t be late or absent 5 times I feel like we are human although it’s a job things happen and it definitely shouldn’t be 5 points we have to wait 6 months for the points to disappear. We have protected pto but that takes months to kick in and we also have a discount card after 3 months of being there but besides all those things it’s a good environment just managers that should find a different job..",4,Current Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Toledo, OH",3/8/21,2021,3,8

If the contract is with a utility company who actually does a great job of keeping their records updated and works to help you prevent damages, then sn't a bad place to work. If you have a contract with a company with poor records and bad policies then unfortunately the managers have to manage according to the arrangement and staff available. For us, we were understaffed and had a poor utility company we were contracted with then the experience will be a bad one.Utility Technician in Winston-Salem, NC1.0on February 24, 2021Worst place too work atReally bad company too work for, they don't care of the weather or conditions they expect you too work, all they care for is their production you get no breaks and if you do they make you work double the next dayUnderground Utility Locator  DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU!

Meh,If you can get a good management team and good coworkers it's a wonderful place to work. The problem is that it's extremely difficult to find that good team to work with.

Specific stores make all the difference ,I chose not to work at the Walmart up the street from me bc it’s gone downhill in so many ways. I do drove to another one but it’s worth it. Love my co workers. Depends what tasks lately. Before covid loved everything. But after covid that’s what made the difference. Hard to do a review bc old of we will go back to as was before. Once wearing masks n got harder to deal w irrational customers. So other than covid I can’t imagine working for another Walmart than the one I do.  I can still have another job part time as well bc they work around each other. ,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Ebensburg, PA",3/7/21,2021,3,7

There is a lot of petty actions by management and coworkers alike and it’s always understaffed.Customers usually come in prepared to hate you and treat you terribly. That is the most positive part of the job. The physical toll the job has on your body in ANY position within the store is atrocious. For example, I have chronic back pain from working as a cashier for only 7 months at the age of 16.There are essentially no bonuses and the annual raise isn’t noteworthy. You will also be lucky to get all of your breaks, or at least all of your breaks in full. The attendance system is also always pressured on you and severely strict, to the point of being unbearably stressful. ",1,Former Employee,Front End Cashier ,"Louisville, KY",3/6/21,2021,3,6

Great place to work but corporate can be a pain.,"Short Story: Walmart gave extra responsibilities to Service Desk (turning it into a supervisor position) without an increase in pay.Long Story: Corporate decided to remove the CSM position, giving many of their responsibility to the Service Desk Associates. The changes technically made Service Desk a supervisor position over most of the upfront. My personal goal at Walmart was to eventually move into a supervisor role so I was happy with these changes, however, without an increase in pay it was somewhat bittersweet.

At first everything was fine but after a few months, the co-workers decided that they didn’t want to work anymore, so I had to do everything. Some co-workers thought they could do whatever they wanted. I told a supervisor and he didn’t care. After about 6 months in the deli, I went over to electronics. Everything was good until I ran into the same problem.. lazy co-workers and braindead managers. The managers do not care about you. They will replace you.

Hired under false pretenses and ridiculed for needing time off for dr visit,"I was hired as a pharm tech. I spent all of my time there at the cash register (the 3 months that I was supposed to be showing my skills as a pharmacy tech). I often asked to do more BC I am licensed but to no avail. I was told in my evaluation that I was hired to be a cashier, but that was never told to me at any point. I was always told it was too busy to train me on other things but I already knew how to do other things from previous experience. I was also told the schedule needed to be rearranged too much for my dr appts. Well. I had ONE the entire time and it gave 17 days notice that I needed to swap my shift. I wasnt allowed to see the schedule or I would have asked someone to switch myself. But they scheduled me for one of my days off 2 days ahead of time and i didnt know until the morning of BC my app wasnt working. I was saying I was glad I saw it and got accused of complaining about the schedule. Basically, I didnt know what I was getting into being hired to be a tech but ACTUALLY being hired to be a cashier without be told. And there was little help or guidance to help me understand what was expected from me. Very judgemental staff and management and very hard to please when you arent told what it is that they want from you. I was told I need to have a thick skin to work in a pharmacy but that has not been my experience anywhere else. That should say it all.

Not take care drivers,It was an entertaining job until they decided to change the rules of the game thus harming the drivers by changing the time they let you know when an order is about to be picked up from 2 hours to only 45 minutes which you run the risk of driving 30 minutes  to the store and only keep that order without knowing if they are going to send you an order but the change they have made thinking only of them is unfair.

At my facility, favoritism was rampant as was micromanagement. The company loves to cut employee hours when they overspend on other areas of the budget. Schedules are generally flexible but they try and scare you in to having open availability. Specifically, being back in Electronics, I was often expected to run sporting goods, paint counter, and garden center additionally.

Was pulled aside and was lectured about not working with motivation during Christmas which I was because of exhaustion work by myself in the seasonal and garden so was required to clean and maintain those areas with about 50+ customers all with children constantly making a mess with no assistance whatsoever. 0/10 would not recommend working here. As well as not working with employees that need schedule change to meet schooling and religious requirements. Former coworker had trying going to school but personal denied the schedule needed for them to be able to go to school for me I needed Sundays to go to church but schedule never interfered with that. As of recently as well they had employees  beginning entire and parking on the garden size but proceeded to fill the parking spaces with pallets to keep employees from parking.,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Palmdale, CA",3/4/21,2021,3,4
Cashier,Working at walmart was great if you dont wanna deal with customers and dont mind doing menial repetitive work. If you are lazy or chronically tired dont work as a warehouse associate.

Horrible stressful,At Whitehall Walmart they don’t care about the associates I killed my self trying to fix what others did worked harder then everyone in my team and that meant nothing to them the take advantage of those who work hard and treat them like trash management has no idea what they are doing and if you know the correct way to do things you are there Enemy they don’t appreciate you at all they prefer to have people that don’t work and don’t care about what they are doing you know those that still time and work one pallet in 8 hours,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Whitehall Township, PA",3/4/21,2021,3,4

Terrible place to work. ,"As an employee of Wal-Mart I was very much dissatisfied with practically everything. Not to say I didn't learn anything but what I did learn wasn't because of my love of my employer, my job, or any type of training. Everything I learned at this job was to make my customers happy.As the title states I would give Wal-Mart a negative review in everything. I'll start with job work and life balance. There really wasn't any balance. I was a soft-lines associate according to my job coding that meant I would work in clothes, shoes, and jewelry. Jewelry only as needed. However this is not what I did. I was constantly pulled from one area to another. I was at several points pulled up to cashier without any training, scheduled in jewelry, sent over to zone in other areas, and at other times pulled to other areas than I was scheduled within the clothes areas. What I'm saying I was constantly doing the job of at least three to four people on a daily basis. This doesn't make for much of a balance of anything.Now on to compensation and benefits. From the day I started to the day I was let go I never made much more on my pay checks than I did from day one. Even though I had received raises my hours were constantly being cut the longer I worked there. As to benefits I wasn't eligible for benefits as part time until I had worked there for two years and the benefits that were offered were a joke. The health insurance barely covered anything and that's about all they offered that was of any interest. While you could invest as an employee it wasn't really something I saw as worth investing in - more...",1,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Lakewood Ranch, FL",3/4/21,2021,3,4

"Great pay, terrible management. ","Walmart’s management is terrible. You could work your butt off yet most of the managers fail to realize the hard work you put in. Management picks favorites.

Love the position ,"The position has been great over the past 10+years but but the way the company is run now I am no longer happy with the company.

"Only good if you need a job, they'll hire anyone. ",Bad place to work. Demoralizing. Unbalanced.

Not good pay,When management finds a spot that you do fantastic in they don’t want to help you advance any further then that position. They pay is not very good. When I transferred from a low cost of living state to a high cost of living state they didn’t compensate for the change but when I transferred from a high cost of living to a low cost of living they made sure to cut my pay.

Good not great,"For retail, Walmart wasn't bad. There were a lot of positives. But retail politics creep in everywhere it seems. I guess the same can be said about all jobs.

this job will suck the life out of you,"walmart is a terrible company to work for. the pay is criminal for the work they push us to do and the way they treat us. their benefits are nice, match up to 6% on 401k contributions, good insurance options. but it is not worth being treated like garbage day after day. they pride themselves on having good opportunities for regular associates to move up the chain and promote, but that never happens, ever. all the managers are lazy. your work is NEVER good enough for them. i work like a dog for this company, i stay late, i go above and beyond expectations, and i never receive so much as a thank you. you know what they do to people who bend over backwards to give the best work? they get them in trouble. it keeps hard workers where they're at, unable to switch departments or promote. ive received 4 write ups in the two years ive worked at walmart, all of them were reversed and taken off after calling the ethics line and getting them investigated for false accusations. they will find ONE thing wrong with your work and get you for it, and if they cant find something? they make it up. they used to give us a little bonus every quarter based on how many hours you worked and how well the store performed, but they're taking it away now. you can request time off a year in advance and they will deny it. if you're thinking about working for this company, dont. especially if you have a good work ethic, it will destroy you.",2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper/Stocker ,"Janesville, MN",3/1/21,2021,3,1

Insanly stressfull place to work,"Walmart corporate has turned into a greedy money centric business from the family run business with its family centric goals set on people and growing them. Hourly associates make as much as team leads(hourly assistant managers) now. They do not value people just what they can earn them. Mr Sam is rolling over in his grave at what his company has become. The first thing you have hammered into you is you are replaceable regardless of years of employment with the company or what you have done for the company. They only take disabled people because the federal government forces them too. Walmart can be a good starter job but its not a place to build a career. Their management teams only care about covering thier own behinds and what money they can make.

Its a job. ,"The money is decent, the job is not worth it depending on what department you're in. If you're a stocker/unloader you would be better off working for a distribution center of some kind. The time limits they give and the amount of effort they expect you to put in on a daily basis is a bit ridiculous for an hourly wage. Walmart associates are supposed to get yearly raises and I know people who have been at this store since it opened and STILL haven't gotten a yearly raise. It seems this establishment picks and chooses who gets raises. Ive personally seen about 30 or 40 employees quit in my department alone since I've started and I have only worked there for a year, this place has a crazy high turnover rate and having worked there, I see why. I would avoid this place if at all possible. ",1,Former Employee,Stocker/Receiver ,"Abingdon, VA",3/1/21,2021,3,1

You get protected and regular PTO but getting your days approved is like pulling teeth because most managers wait until the last minute to look at it. Also this store is full of favoritism in both departments I’ve worked in.  They are currently changing to set schedules for the whole store which should help with work life balance.

Probably not worth it under most circumstances,"Job itself was not complicated, but I felt that management made it more complicated by not giving us a more thorough training.

Hectic and Crazed,"The work is self explanatory but, all training goes out the window because management is being pulled in every direction imaginable.

Until the ending of my time there, the supervisors over my section were not the best. I’ve met quite a few individuals there, and everyone seems like a friendly person - just a bit lackluster when it comes to managing other associates.The management constantly felt like they weren’t concerned for associates, nor did they heed to any requests to make the assembly/unloading easier (small things, like a single associate would’ve helped), at the end though a new supervisor had joined and changed everything around.The new supervisor did a wonderful job helping out the associates and pushed for us to try our best, I appreciated Walmart so much more once she joined.",3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Anniston, AL",2/26/21,2021,2,26

Good pay and benefits but they will work you to the bone,"I worked here for about 6 months. I started out loving the job, talking to co-workers while working, and having fun unloading the truck. I made the mistake of telling my supervisor that I liked to be the person standing inside the truck putting boxes onto the conveyor belt. Worst mistake ever. Next thing I knew, that was all they ever had me do every single day I worked, for at least 3 months straight with no way to get out of doing it. After we finish unloading the truck every day, we have to go out onto the sales floor and spend the entire rest of our shift stocking the shelves in the grocery department. This would be fine if it weren't for the ridiculous expectations that management had for our team. Each employee is expected to be able to finish stocking an entire overstacked pallet of grocery products in under an hour if they are alone. They are expected to keep up this unrealistic rate for multiple hours until the end of their shift. The majority of employees on my team never meet these expectations, and are always getting yelled at and threatened to be brought to the managers office and written up as a consequence. When I first started working here, all of the co-workers on my team were extremely friendly and usually made conversation while working in the isles to pass time, but over time while I worked here, most of my co-workers on my team mysteriously disappeared and were slowly replaced with new, much more obedient and quiet co-workers.

"Soul crushing, but it pays the bills",I've worked here for almost 5 years and it's definitely had some ups and downs. The only thing that makes it even remotely bearable is that it pays well enough at the end of the pay period.

Awful Company to work for,"Working for Walmart has been an interesting experience. As long as a person chooses to only be a cashier. The job is okay. Once you move to Electronics(entertainment), Sporting Goods, or any other area other than a cashier they expect more than you are paid. They complain when you request more than two days off in a row, even if you have PTO. They expect you to work over each day regardless. There is a high lack of communication among management. The hierarchy of management is completely trashed. ",2,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Union, SC",2/24/21,2021,2,24

Depending on shift and position working for this company can be frustrating ,I have worked for Walmart for over 4+ years during this time I work my way up to management to only step down in management because of inconsistencies favoritism and things only being acknowledged when it makes a store manager look good any other issues to me I put aside until is necessary for attention ,1,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Raleigh-Durham, NC",2/24/21,2021,2,24

Great coworkers ,Never work the morning shift. It’s very intense and people get in a sour mood. Customers can be difficult to deal with but most are very nice. Going outside during winter is horrible even if you have warm clothes and the other associates fail to take turns going out in the cold and it’s usually one person freezing their butt off. They sometimes give you only a 30 min lunch without asking you first. They choose only a certain amount of people to do generals which is the less stressful one and you will usually never get chosen to do that one. Also you usually have to pick 100 items an hour and if you have leg issues (like I have leg weakness and pain every day which is a medical thing) or trouble seeing they still yell at you if you don’t have enough. I was told I need to walk faster and do better even though my average pick rate was about 96 which is only 4 away from 100. And if you had a bad day and didn’t do well they posted it on a board for everyone to see. I made some great friends here and I hope to keep in contact with them. ,2,Former Employee,Walmart personal shopper ,"Cadillac, MI",2/24/21,2021,2,24
Great environment ,You meet so many people while working here. There are so  many friendly faces and it’s a healthy work environment.

"Only apply if you can tough out long hours, a decent job","Been at the distribution center for a few years now. Working in grocery supply chain is one of the most secure jobs you can have due to the fact it doesn't matter what the economy does, people need and depend to get food/drink supplies to them. Working here requires a solid safety mindset, positive attitude, and good attendance. If you believe in all of those, you'll be fine here. My biggest complaint is some of the changes that seem to always be coming from Home Office. The positives include: they're always investing in technology and equipment to make the job more efficient and easier. The downsides are that some policy changes or ideas aren't really necessary or needed. I don't wish to elaborate, however I believe it has made retention of new associates much harder and it feels like we can't catch up and always ""putting out fires"", when it seemed like we had a better grasp a few years ago. Some workdays and workloads can also be excessive. ",4,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Lewiston, ME",2/24/21,2021,2,24

Values and Culture,"Walmarts core values, culture, opportunity and total benefit package is great. If you're motivated, come to work and inform your supervisors of your interest in advancing in the company, you can definitely move up the ranks. Inclusion and respect is what makes Walmart a great place to work.  The work itself is very straightforward - BUT, there is a lot to do and it's very fast paced. A short staffed day will make it that much more difficult to meet the goals of the day.

Not great! ,"My biggest issue is that my department is so huge yet there are so little people there in a shift. It’s usually 2-4 people at the most, rarely ever do we have a team lead. It’s also not a very flexible schedule. You can only collect a maximum of 4 attendance points in 6 months or else you’re fired. Yet they rarely even give you off the days you request in advance and will 100% decline if you ask off on a key date. They also make it extremely hard for you to change your schedule, sometimes they don’t even change it. Most new hires aren’t even trained properly so they end up quitting soon after they’re hired. Some managers are better than others, and workers can be very cliquey as well. The only reason why I stay is the pay is almost unmatchable anywhere else locally and my department is so short-staffed I’d feel bad leaving.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cranberry Township, PA",2/23/21,2021,2,23

"Efficient work environment, stressful at times. Good management is pivotal. ","A well-constructed schedule can allow for the days to go by smoothly with little to no severe frustration or events. However, if the manager hasn't scheduled an adequate amount of workers for a time, it can be chaotic. A large portion of your job, depending on where exactly you work in the ""chain of operations,"" can rely heavily on others to efficiently complete all of your tasks in a timely manner given the scale of orders you'll receive. For example, as a Dispenser or Delivery Driver, in order to have totes to stage and dispense, Personal Shoppers must have sufficiently picked through the commodities for the time slot. If they haven't, you may be delayed heavily. Compoundingly, if a Personal Shopper nil picks an item, it must go through the exceptions system, where a Personal Shopper or Exceptions Picker will then try to find or substitute the item. After this, a Manager or permissioned associate must then approve the substitutions so that you can finally quality check, stage, or dispense the order. This job is often customer service heavy, so you can expect to communicate with customers in/around their vehicles or the store.

"Very relax, Independently team lead environment","I enjoyed many aspects of working at Walmart. It was a very relax store to work, there wasn't a lot of micromanaging and work was very straight forward. There was an abundance of task to complete for daily operations, it kept you busy but was very tedious at times, sometimes it was one clear objective and sometimes it was multiple things to complete in different departments and areas of the store. All in all I enjoyed my time there work wise. The only thing that I think Walmart as a whole needs to work on (I can't stress this enough) is WORK CULTURE its absolutely an important key factor in getting things done day by day. To be more specific in the category of work culture, I want to emphasize two sub categories of work culture where the company needs to improve;  Team Approach and Atmosphere. Whether it be Associates, Store Management all the way up to District Management, there needs to be strong communication, good team foundation and building morale. All levels of the company need to be more personable and engaging. ",3,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Hampton, VA",2/22/21,2021,2,22
Itll do till you find something better,"Its Walmart. I didnt really know what that meant until I actually got a job there. People who are bubbly and upbeat have their souls sucked out to the point they cannot interact with each other. I like to joke while I work and the majority of people walk around as empty shells. Its disheartening to see people who you meet from orientation that were full of life only to see then beaten down. You can tell a lot about an organization on the success they produce on the backs of workers making poverty wages. None of the people they put in Management positions have degrees so they have no formal training. In fact, if you do have years of management experience with a solid educational background you will not be hired for a leadership position.

"Total learning package for young adults. [Great workers, poor managers]","Working @ Walmart will teach young adults a lot about having/maintaining a job. It will introduce you to good people but show you that good people can also be bad co-workers. It is going to teach you that everyone has their own story and that working @ Walmart (or any retail/customer service/fast food job) should not be looked down upon. Most importantly, working @ Walmart will teach young adults a lot about themselves such likes/dislikes from working in different departments, to adaptability/flexibility in scheduling, pay/ benefits, strength/ weakness in skills set, and co-workers/managers traits.My time working @ Walmart as a Personal Shopper associate was enjoyable. It was hard, busy, hectic, especially during the holidays, and only more since the pandemic. For a stretch of about 3 months, taking both my 15min breaks did not even occur to me. I would automatically forgo my breaks because I knew there was no way I could fit the breaks in without some repercussion. I stayed at Walmart, for as long as I did, because I was fortunate enough to have a good team of co-workers. In the numerous absences of our managers, we were able to effectively run ourselves. In the numerous disadvantageous situations, our managers/ higher up put upon their us, we were able to consistently meet standards untouchable by the degree of difficulty. I left this job not because I could not deal with the karens, or I had bad co-workers, or because the pay was bad or because of the hard work. I chose to leave this job because of the lack of leadership.

There were hard days when I would come home crying because customers would insult me and talk down to me. I felt worse about myself the longer I worked there. But it was not the staff or management that mistreated  me it was the public. The type of people that shop there can be very impatient and rude. Especially If its your first retail job as it was with me. I now have thicker skin and would not allow anyone to treat me the way i was there. Even If it cost me my job. But at the time, I did not know any better. It was a really hard two years. But it did break me into retail the hard way. lol You need to learn to be thicked skin and not take any disrespect.

Expect to never have a lunch on time and be expected to be asked to stay late and being on the clock for up to 12 hours with only one break. Meanwhile management has already been in the parking lot to smoke 2 packs of cigarettes. The only upside to this company is the benefits that you can receive.

Loved the job and coworkers. Management is terrible ,"Working at Walmart was definitely a learning experience and a bit life changing also. It was a good job and I had many great coworkers. I enjoyed my line of work and I believe I executed my tasks well. The management though, is absolutely awful. They’re all arrogant and very disrespectful to customers and employees alike. Anytime one of us approached them with a question regarding an issue on the job or something small, we were only given a nasty attitude and they never helped with answers. There were times a couple customers became so frustrated with them they had left the building in tears. Also, they pick favorites. If you don’t stand around on your phone like management then they’ll treat you like pure garbage. I’m not the only one who can vouch for this either. All in all it’s a good job and good pay as well, you’re always busy and learning. It’s good experience under the belt. My personal complaint though is that management isn’t dependable at all. At least during my employment there. ",4,Former Employee,Stocking Associate ,"Uniontown, PA",2/19/21,2021,2,19

You may well be given 15 pallets of freight to work by yourself and the made-up time limit says you have 5 hours to do it, and if you don't then you get coached (Walmart-speak for written up), and after 3 of those you're fired.  Your job security is literally determined by random numbers.  Management couldn't care less if the numbers are right and wouldn't know if they were anyway.The only way to move up is to brown nose management ASAP otherwise you're going nowhere.

Got a 3rd store manager and completely lacked a good sense of leadership, has no clue how to run a store effectively, never took care of managers or associates. Many have quit that store.

OGP can be high stress with not much compensation ,"I work in Online Grocery Pickup and make the base pay ($11). Haven’t been there super long but from what I can see the advancement is not great. Lots of hard working people that have been there 1-2+ years that still haven’t gotten advancement or raises. Most people who get team lead or supervising positions come in from other stores. Can be easy going if you’re hired on to do pick walks (making the orders), but if you’re dispensing (taking the orders out to costumers’ cars) it may be one the most stressful jobs you can have at walmart. Management is can be very dissociative and unhelpful. Fellow associates are not super helpful if you’re struggling/need help/have questions, so if you don’t understand you’re role by the time you’re training ends (2-3 days) you’re on your own for the majority of it.

I learned a lot from working there, but it's more of the bad than the good. The only way I would recommend it is if it's a short term job.

Poor Workplace and terrible first job,"I worked at the Walmart in Paris, KY for literally two and a half days. After being sat in a room for two hours and being preached at about how ‘amazing’ and ‘open’ Walmart’s schedule is for employees two days later I was scheduled to work days and hours I specifically never applied for (I run an animal rescue, I’m engaged, and also trying to work on a house but my times I put down were acceptable for a normal 35-40 hour work week) , after talking to my employer she literally said “well we would’ve never hired you if you couldn’t work that” and I was forced to quit. The work itself was enjoyable (Online Grocery) but coworkers were rude and immature and often spoke rudely of and to customers for absolutely no reason in the two days I was there.Negative work environment 100% until you’re alone and out on the floor working.

Love my Coworkers.,My coworkers and the diversity of the staff is the only thing I enjoyed. Only one of my managers was helpful. The rest of them were so hard to find and talk to and it's like they never listened to me because nothing ever changed. Even simple but important things needed to be changed in my schedule. They do not act as they care about their employees and they do not enforce any procedures to keep staff safe. I would only consider going back because I miss the people. The job always left me stressed and tired.,2,Former Employee,Fresh Produce Associate ,"Woonsocket, RI",2/18/21,2021,2,18

All they care about is numbers.  A few techs have been hurt trying to do work that they have no clue on how to do.  Nobody cares.  Many people beg for training on complex systems.  Managers act like they know everything in meetings and act like they are their for you when the big managers are around but in the field you get zero support.

Management is the absolute worst,Walmart is the worst job I’ve ever had. The management team is terrible. It’s difficult to get them to do anything you need. You run yourself ragged at a place like this. Absolutely no support from management. They always highlight your wrong doings but never mention or applaud your work.

Could be worse,"Not a bad place to work if you need the income, overall the company itself is alright and tries to go the extra step for their employees, but that doesn't always go as planned.When I first started here, one of the biggest things that was stressed to me by other associates was the lack of structure within the store. This hasn't been a huge issue for me yet, but it's obvious that it's true to some extent. You hardly ever get breaks or lunches on time, if you even get either breaks. The store manager is nowhere to be seen, and I have yet to meet him, even after several months of being employed with Walmart. Coaches rarely enforce rules that really matter, but are quick to nitpick things that are out of their responsibility. Just general stuff of that nature. However, it's a laid back job for the most part. Everyone in my department gets along usually and I've met some pretty great people here so far. The two biggest issues would be constantly being understaffed, and entitled customers that think what they say is law.

It was ok,"At first I loved my job at walmart, They really needed me. I was a stand in ""csm"", cashier, customer servicer desk, and a stocker. The customers didn't bother me, it was how the managers treated the customers that bothered me. It was christmas time and a couple was getting their kids bikes out of layaway. Instead of a manager getting a piece of equipment to get the bikes down, they had me running around the store to find the exact bikes. I found them outside lawn and garden wet because it had been raining. They told me to give them those bikes. I just don't see that right because they already picked out those certain bikes and paid for them.",3,Former Employee,Associate ,"North Vernon, IN",2/15/21,2021,2,15

Very difficult to get promoted. Management only cares about themselves ,Walmart is a good job for a retire or high school or college student. I wouldn't recommend anyone else working there unless your good friends with management..its all about favoritism and upper management are brainwashed to treat associates like dirt under there feet.

All is for show,"Anything said or done at Walmart is either a complete lie or someone trying to add to their resume. They pay handsomely and will constantly remind you of that fact. Long disorganized work days with managers that are barely qualified to be associates. I cannot count the times a management position was held open until the ""right candidate"" was eligible for a promotion. Their eligibility hinged on when accountability for excessive absenses, accuracy goals, or integrity issues fell off after 6 months. You can absolutely be successful and make a great deal of money. It will only cost your soul, your health, and all your family time in the process. Best advice I can give is do not trust anyone.",1,Former Employee,Area Manager ,"Shelbyville, TN",2/15/21,2021,2,15
Going downhill ,"I work in the online grocery department which used to be a decent area. But recently it's become less than worth it for me to be there anymore, with the amount of calloffs we have every single day.

Avoid unless desperate,"The work itself is straightforward/simple enough. Until someone calls off, or the department is understaffed, or not scheduled properly. You will be expected to do the work of three when you become the only one working in the department. They rarely hire new people, and when they do, those people rarely stick around for long; they won't be replaced either.Management will alter your schedule without asking/telling you first.Calling off was only ever ""forgiven"" in inclement weather; doctor's notes aren't accepted for any reason.Equipment is always in short supply, forcing you to go without or share with someone else when possible. Regardless of how much it impacts your work, management will still blame you for it.Management will sometimes take its time approving/denying requests for time off, usually waiting until the last possible moment.Mental/emotional health of employees does not matter.If any of the above issues are brought up with said management, it will never be corrected and flagrantly ignored.",1,Former Employee,Deli Clerk ,"Xenia, OH",2/15/21,2021,2,15

Learned just how impersonal and bottom dollar this company is, puts on airs but behind scene is different story.

Chill Workplace ,I was overnight stocking so I was chilling working by myself and didn’t have any other things to worry about. Just stock your isles zone and leave. Overall it’s a nice job to have.,4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Chattanooga, TN",2/12/21,2021,2,12
Don’t do it,The only thing good about this job was a few people I worked with aside from that I don’t recommend. They’ll skip out on paying you and blame it on a technicality and they’ll have you work so much overtime corporate would notice and put a limit you your individual hours,2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper/Sales Associate ,California,2/12/21,2021,2,12
It’s a fun workplace if you work with the right people ,"I worked for walmart for almost 3 years, I started out as a cashier at the front end and then switched over to Online Grocery Pickup. I had some good times and some bad times over there. It really all depends who you work with and how well you work with them. ",4,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Brigham City, UT",2/12/21,2021,2,12
Very political. ,"I have received a job offer right on the spot. Unfortunately, they contacted me 2 days later to let me know that they can't move forward with my application. I was  previously employed at Walmart and left the company with a great record. Thanks to them I lost my current employer, because I had already turned in my notice. They don't care about you! Very unprofessional!",1,Former Employee,Pharmacist ,"South Ogden, UT",2/12/21,2021,2,12
"Stressful, mentally challenging, and favoritism ",When I first started it was great. Well after a month it was getting stressful to the point that my family was worried about my health and still are.. During the beginning of the pandemic they would ask me to work overtime and come in earlier almost everyday of the week which I always said yes. I was never late and always good on time until my world got turned upside down. Now that I'm having trouble cause of personal problems and they are aware of my situation I'm hearing my manager telling people and other coworkers I'm not reliable. Still work here but can't express how much stress I have here. They ask to get things done in a certain about of time which is impossible and most times expect you to get things done while helping customers at the same time when you are alone.  Don't get me wrong there's good things but you would need to be with the right people or a good area. A lot of favoritism and also threatening associates which I believe is wrong in a work area but can't report it when they are besties with management. ,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Kenedy, TX",2/12/21,2021,2,12

I don’t recommend working for Walmart no,The good thing about working here is that is 3 minutes away from my house the bad about working at Walmart is that mgr change employees schedule without no notice managers at Walmart think that the employees had no life outside Wal mart and they cut employees hours and the pay is awful I do not recommend working at Wal mart poor management poor HR poor pay ,2,Former Employee,Stocker ,Walmart neighborhood ,2/11/21,2021,2,11
not a fun place to work at all,Walmart management do not know what they doing.  Too many bosses and not enough employees.  Always cutting the employees hours off and don't care how they make their living.

Poor experience,"It's Walmart and it's as bad as you can imagine.  Low pay, impossible to get weekends  off. I went in as a seasonal and was asked to create my schedule.  They didn't follow my schedule one bit so I wonder why they had me do it in the first place.  75% of the people I came across in the store seemed pretty miserable.

"Fun workplace , a diverse of people",Throughout my Walmart experience I learned how to be a more open person as I would have to work as a team with my coworkers. Some days were easy depending on the holidays or some days were extremely difficult as many people would come shopping and take carts rapidly. The management wasn’t too good all the time sometimes they would send help for us cart pushers but other days they would leave you completely helpless ,5,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",2/11/21,2021,2,11
Miss it,The amount of points a person could get changed half way through my employment. It went from 9 down to 5. The managers were not always the best and they moved people up the ladder by how many people did not like the person. They retaliated against me for going up chain of command and let me go while on FMLA. Same rules didn’t apply to everyone.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service / Cashier / Product Return and Inventory Management ,"Federal Way, WA",2/11/21,2021,2,11
All they care about is pushing freight,"All they care about is pushing freight, the announcement you hear that states we are closing early so we can clean and sanitize the store, that's not true.  They close early so they can spend the time pushing freight to the floor.  Store management doesn't care about the staff, they care about the most recent inventory losses, pushing freight to the floor and when help is asked for to help mitigate the losses going out the front door, no one listens.  ",1,Former Employee,Co-Manager ,Connecticut,2/11/21,2021,2,11
The good thing that stood out was that we worked as a team. The bad thing was the managers. ,The management was weak. We had one good one and one bad one.

More cons then pros. ,"Cons: Long shifts, no holiday pay, they play favorites, (the favorites get promoted, or employee of the month) employees have been employee of the month multiple times over other workers who actually work hard. they don’t follow covid cautions. They don’t relay covid patients to the workers that they were directly around them. Don’t follow open door policy. Get paid less then actual Walmart warehouse workers. Clocking in three minutes early and one mins late result in half a point, when a lot of employees clock in. Points roll off every 6 months. (We have families and things happen) Pros: free food for holidays, free grand prizes for thanksgiving and Christmas season.

"Co-workers are interesting, the job... not so much. ","It is what it is. Cut and dry. If you need a job, you will 9 out 10 get hired which can be a life saver. When the dust of thankfullness settles, you see the job for what it is worth. In the beginning your hours are consistent, but then you barely get scheduled. Training is next to non existent (depending on whom you may be paired with and how they may have been trained.) Advancement is a joke. If you own a set of golden knee pads and have aquired strong knees during your adult working life you just might squeeze by into an advancement role. But all in all it is what you make of it, I guess. Lastly, who your store manager is as a decent human, says alot. ",3,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",2/11/21,2021,2,11

Working For Walmart Is Great Except...,I like my job at Walmart. My only complaint with the company is their scheduling. You don't get your days off together which causes burnout and they schedule a lot of turn arounds. There have been days I've had to go back to work after only getting an hour or two sleep due to having to close and then be back to open. It can be exhausting.,4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Minden, LA",2/11/21,2021,2,11

Not recommended. ,"Working at Walmart was an absolutely miserable experience for me, as the store I worked at was just recently put under new management and nobody knew what was happening. We were instructed to leave palettes on the floor to work on while customers had to avoid the boxes/plastic that ended up getting everywhere in the process. I was strung out in multiple areas of the store when I only knew the Jewelry/Shoes dept. and was expected to know everything about every other department of the store when sent there to work. I ended up spending way too much time in departments I didn’t know to begin with and ended up almost knowing more about them than the department I was supposed to be in.

Horrible management ,I've worked in ogp for nearly a year and it's by far the worst job I've ever had. Management doesn't care about the employees they only care that they meet metrics.

Communist society,"I’ve worked at a few Fortune 500 corporations and always work into management positions. I’ve never had a company go longer then 6 months without prompting me due to my insane work ethic and desire to add value through myself and on a macro level. Walmart abused me and my drive for 3 years while frequently dangling carrots in front of me that I never reached. I was written up twice though, for non issues. Meanwhile I had coworkers who’d spend 7 of their 8 hour shifts BS’ing with people in other departments while I kindly and politely completed the various department (I’ve worked every, every single department and was store receiving) duties. Never complained, never talked negatively, just was friendly to everyone and the customers frequently learned my name and in electronics (cell phones) and sporting goods, would specifically request me. At the end of the day all employees get the same review and raise usually. Nepotism reigns supreme and store managers are the commie bosses, their usually some of the most jaded humans to ever walk the earth so hard work is null, kissing up to them is the ONLY way to promotion. Easily the worst people and management I have ever seen in my life and I’ve traveled the world. Worked 2 different Walmart’s and both were equally as despotic.

Lots of favoritism. Work is easy.,"In my time at walmart so far, I have seen a lot of favoritism. They don't pay as much attention to people who work hard, just those who kiss enough tail to be noticed. The work is easy enough, and the benefits are decent. The pay could be a little better, but it's better than minimun wage. There's next to no motivation to stand out through hard work, and getting any kind of promotion can be competitive enough to break long standing friendships. Their response to covid has been the worst thing out of all of it though. They have a person at a specified employee entrance who is supposed to take your temperature and have you take a short questionnaire, but the people they have at the door never actually do it. There's no enforcement of the mask policy either. It says required to enter the building, but half the time people have their masks down around their chin and no one says anything, nor are you allowed to enforce said mask policy.",2,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Jacksonville, FL",2/10/21,2021,2,10
Co-Workers tend to be nice... Not So much the rest...,"Oh boy... where do I start? Most stores tend to be chronically understaffed, which leads to the expectations that you work not just your work, but the work of the unstaffed positions. In cap2, that means we're expected to move fast enough to work shelves and the truck as if we're 2.5 people, and then when you only get enough work done for 1.5 people, you're warned that you're about to be written up for productivity. Management tries to be nice, key word try, but corporate has an ax over their heads, so they end up pushing head office'stoxicity onto you, because otherwise they'd drown in it.

Negatives:  It's hard physical work.  You are also expected to move very fast.  It is also an extremely rigid place to work as far as time and rules go.  You have a lot of the typical big corporate BS rules that make no sense to anyone yet MUST be followed because, that's the rules.  The work is also very repetitive and boring.

But the longer i worked there, the worse it got. Tasks got thrown at me before i was even trained for them. I was expected to do the work of 4 people in half of a shift. I was talked down to and made to feel small and insignificant for simply doing what was asked of me. It’s an incredibly stressful job once they get used to you being there. My advice to you, don’t do your job well at first. Be horrible at it, and slowly improve. They’ll like you more if they think you’re getting better. If you start out strong, their expectations for you will skyrocket and you’ll receive no help. Not to mention i’ve worked there over a year, can work every department in the store, yet i’m still making starting wage and haven’t been given a single growth opportunity or even spoken to about one.",2,Current Employee,Toys Sales Associate ,"Bristol, VA",2/10/21,2021,2,10
Work you harder than anywhere I ever workeded,"They pay pretty well but they run their employees into the ground on a regular basis, they care far more about their numbers and orders than they do about the people who work for them. They write you up if you don't maintain production and don't seem to care about any problems you may have in your efforts to achieve them!",2,Former Employee,Loader/Unloader ,"Ottawa, KS",2/10/21,2021,2,10
"Good breaks, strict, results-driven system","Your value as a worker was determined by your productivity levels. I was new, so my numbers were low. There's a point system for if you're late. Other employees told me it wasn't a big deal, as most of them were late and no one cared. I was fired for being late. The difference? Our productivity numbers. The numbers I'm talking about are how many items per hour you can pick (I worked in online grocery) and how long customers wait to pick up their items. Dispensing was done in one-hour intervals, where you were expected to give every customer in that time frame their orders within three minutes of their arrival. Alone. When orders could have hundreds of items, this was unfair. Managers will get angry if you take too long, say you should ask for help, but also send your help away if you have any. Because you're supposed to be able to do it yourself. When I injured my shoulder from lifting heavy totes of groceries over my head too many times (because I couldn't stop when it started to hurt, because I was supposed to do it without help), I was able to get workers comp. I had to fight for it. My restrictions were largely ignored, as I was put on stocking and cleaning the backs of the shelves when I wasn't supposed to lift or reach with that arm. The breaks and pay are nice, but bottom line, are not worth it. ",2,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Mansfield, TX",2/10/21,2021,2,10
Nice job for a college student...,It is an okay job for a college student or someone without major bills. I was only part-time so the hours was not that great. The managers were rude and didn’t appreciate their employees. ,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Starkville, MS",2/10/21,2021,2,10

"Nothing, rude and walks over people ","I would not recommend working here if you want a secured job. They do not care for employees health and outside commitments. Inside system also is annoying for always having to connect to their specific wifi. No one know stock inventory, online website is always wrong, and no one answers the phone. ",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Alexandria, VA",2/9/21,2021,2,9
"Never got any hours but they do offer decent hourly pay, managers suck",I never saw a store manager unless there was something going on in the store. All the csms were very unprofessional and were too young to be held accountable. At the end of my employment  I was only scheduled 4 hours a week for able 3 months. Managers never took care of any problems.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Joplin, MO",2/9/21,2021,2,9
Ok job..,Managers are kinda shady. I always felt that I was failing because the managers push you soo hard to finish the work so they won’t get introuble. Pay was good but I definitely feel like I worked too hard for the pay. I felt like i had No work life balance.,2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,North Carolina,2/9/21,2021,2,9

Terrible ,Working there drained the life out of me. It was repetitive and boring.  Management was very unsupportive and they would play favorites. I am so glad I got out ,1,Former Employee,Cashier and Customer Service ,"Baton Rouge, LA",2/9/21,2021,2,9
Ehhh,It's fine over all it really is but number 1 thing u probably want to keep in mind is the more u learn the more u do they will run u ragged if u let them its a decent job for young adults but probably not a career I mean u can make a career out if it if u really want by all means but usually it's just a stepping stone to the next place u actually want a career in oh and after the new management system was put in place promotions are  Scarce,3,Former Employee,Food Sales Associate ,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",2/9/21,2021,2,9
Terrible hours no flexibility ,"First off great pay, if all you care about is money then this is your job, but there’s no flexibility, i wanted morning shift (4-12) but it wasn’t available at the time so i took the second shift (2-11) and everytime there was an opening anywhere else for a morning shift i was either denied or lied to ",1,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Raynham, MA",2/9/21,2021,2,9

overall good place to work and advance if you're looking for that,My direct supervisor is great. Has taught me more while working under him than I have since being with company. Some of the managers are lacking in the social skills needed to be in the position that they are in. A LOT of favoritism. Store manager is awesome! She definitely runs the store appropriately. ,4,Current Employee,Food Sales Associate ,"Cumming, GA",2/9/21,2021,2,9

Stressful and everyone is so rude due to overload of work,"I like my job and what I do but I hate the work place. Everyone is always upset and rude to each other due to the overload of work because there is not enough employees. The store is always super disorganized,no one really knows anything at all,the managers are rude and don't really care about employees or customers, it's always all about the numbers and sales. They said that there is room for growth but honestly I don't believe it,unless you have no life and are okay with being called in on your days off.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Foothill Ranch, CA",2/9/21,2021,2,9
Walmart,The only thing that I liked about working there was the people who I worked with the pay wasn't good the work was hard and persistent and Everytime someone left the job u would do your job and their job because they don't like to hire alot of people and they don't accept overtime and I didn't get a raise for the amount of work I was doing as stocker cartpusher and maintenance,1,Former Employee,Custodian ,"12639 Blanco Rd, San Antonio, TX 78216",2/9/21,2021,2,9
Okay,It's alright. This was my first warehouse job and it's actually really easy. Management doesn't seem to know what they're doing. Starting pay is 16.5 .,3,Former Employee,Warehouse Worker ,"Gardner, KS",2/9/21,2021,2,9
I enjoyed the people I worked with.,"Wal-Mart is constantly changing, Sometimes the changes are harder to keep up with and do your job correctly or as fast as they want you to do it. They want to promote you constantly and if you don't promote it seems they don't want to keep you around very long because they want to hire new people as they promote older people. They have caps on their pay for each level.  Now they are cross training everyone to do all things in all departments and the job is harder and harder with no compensation for the extra work.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Springdale, AR",2/9/21,2021,2,9
Horrible ,"The managers can’t even keep up with their associates. They never like to help associates out until they are in close range or it’s something important. Management has power issues and can’t seem to settle that with each other. They can’t even respect your time off due to religious reasons or days that aren’t open in your availability because they’ll still schedule you, after you notified them multiple times that you just can’t work that day.",1,Former Employee,Customer Service ,1189 E March Lane,2/9/21,2021,2,9
Managers only care about themselves.,"The first couple of months I enjoyed working there. Then, it didn’t take me long to realize that the management has a serious issue. They don’t properly train their associates, they just shove them onto the salesfloor and hope for the best. They only care about themselves and what they feel is best for them. The managers gave me a hard time and tried to make me feel bad for trying to seek accommodations for my mental health. Entirely too stressing to only get paid $11 and no raise after a year. Some people I know have worked there for 5 years only to get paid a little over $12.  Managers also talk poorly to associates. They have little to no respect. Would not recommend working there.",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Lake Charles, LA",2/9/21,2021,2,9

Productive and Flexible,"You can learn a lot by working at Walmart. Employees are willing to help you if you don't know anything. Solid position as long as you get work done. Management is understanding, but will try to push you to your potential. The environment is generally friendly, the only hard part is pushing your quota. Can manage lifestyle and work decently. All around decent job.",4,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Macon, GA",2/9/21,2021,2,9
"Starts out ok, goes downhill fast.","First few weeks were great, everyone was friendly and made you feel important. But as soon as your 90 days are up, all that matters to management is you get your job done no matter what. As long as it doesn't include any overtime. They wouldn't work with my schedule, and showed favoritism all over the place. They also refused to do anything about a creep who was stalking me when I was the only person in my section at night. The only good thing about this job was the two coworkers that became my friends. They don't work there anymore either because of all the utter stupidity.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Calhoun, GA",2/9/21,2021,2,9
Not fun ,I was a meat/produce team associate and it was the worst. They didn’t help us out and expected us to do a job for 3-4 people with only 1 or 2. Not to mention they would pull us from doing our job to help other departments ,1,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Florence, AL",2/9/21,2021,2,9
"Good coworkers, but management sucks. ","If you’re looking for a good PT job this would be the place, not for long-term. Not enough pay for the amount of work they require.

Store manager seems nice,Upon hiring they say you get two 15 minute breaks and an hr for lunch. That barely happens. They say they are friendly and good to work for but honestly I’m just there for the money. One of the managers expects us to keep going like we are robots and if you even mention wanting a break or to get some water she frowns and expects you to just go until you drop from exhaustion. ,1,Current Employee,Assosiate ,"Goose Creek, SC",2/9/21,2021,2,9
"Fun coworkers, management needs help",It's a paycheck. Decent starting wage and benefits. Management needs improving. The turnover rate is very high. You work with mostly high school kids. No room for advancement.,3,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Stow, OH",2/9/21,2021,2,9
Productive work environment always something to do very fast pace,The job itself wasnt difficult and helping customers was entertaining but the associates and management where always way to negative and stress everyone out past the point of no return.

Just another body,"Lots of promises of things like job security and a great company culture. Complete BS. Coworkers are pretty rude across the board, especially towards customers. Management is hit or miss, some good ones, some bad ones, but don’t expect any of them to communicate. Also as a temp during a pandemic, keep in mind that you will 100% be let go the moment a Covid diagnosed employee returns from work after ridding themselves of the Rona",1,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Covina, CA",2/9/21,2021,2,9
It was okay for most people.,Working here was just okay. I worked nights and they put me in the freezer section... When I asked to change positions management said they would but never did.

Exhausting.,"I was a CAP 1 associate and we often pick up overnights work and are forced to stay over while they get to leave. The catch? You aren't allowed overtime.

Pays good and always work,"Depending on which Walmart your at will make or break you. I’ve been a automotive technician, over night stocker, back room inventory and over night support manager. The pay and benefits are ok and a quarterly bonus are a plus. Managers ask for way to much all the time and you will get hurt physically. Schedules are horrible, you can close Monday from 4-11pm and then open Tuesday 6am-3. If you get injured, expect your manager and corporate to not help you or work with you. ",2,Current Employee,Automotive lube and tire Technician ,"McAllen, TX",2/8/21,2021,2,8
Love the associates. Do not agree with how we are running things from the very top down. ,Fast paced. High energy. As a leader you must be prepared to bring it everyday. Company sets forth ridiculous goals that we must push very hard to even try to attain. Most of the time we are chasing reports instead of taking care of customers. ,4,Current Employee,Business Coach ,"Greeneville, TN",2/8/21,2021,2,8
If your willing to move around skys the limit,Overall its a good company but it really depends on the store and its management.  Things have changed a lot over the years and there is more focus to the bottom line and not the associate.

Overall just a bad place to work,I worked for Walmart for 6 years third shift and that whole time I only had one good manager. While that job was easy and laid back I was always crapped on by management and was never given the recognition I deserved.I was frequently understaffed in my position and while I was forced to take the position of lead for my department I was never officially given it when the position came up it was given to some from an outside store. This was one among many things that went wrong working for this company.,2,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Murfreesboro, TN",2/8/21,2021,2,8

Say they want you to succeed but dont really give you the tools to do so. ,Management doesn't really give you the tools to succeed. Also says you don't have to be available 24/7 365 days yr.

Okay Place,"It's an okay place if you need employment. The managers aren't so helpful and act like any assistance needed is a burden. It's better than minimum wage but they make sure to keep you as part time so you don't get benefit.

Ok Place ,"The benefits are basically zero. My coworker had their best plan and went to get a root canal and he said it was like he didnt have insurance. There is no PTO and you dont get holidays off but if you stay with them for a year (the shift I got was 3rd shift at the data center working four 10's either wed-sat or sun-wed, so weekends and holidays). But if you last a year doing that they will pay you an extra paycheck every 6 months. This basically amounts to them cashing out what PTO you SHOULD have gotten and giving it to you as a ""bonus"". The group I was with I worked for talent source (back when they were called veritude) for almost 2 years before being hired on to fidelity full time. The only reason I was converted was because someone at fidelity in our group got fired... otherwise I'd still be a contractor.

Fun people to work with but management is horrible ,Working at Walmart can be a fun experience if you are easy to get along with the thing that ruins Walmart is how they have the people to work but don’t schedule nobody causing short staffed situations and poor management if your not liked by them then your whole time there will be bad.,1,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Seagoville, TX",2/8/21,2021,2,8

Coworkers can make or break your job. ,"My Coworkers were easy to get along with and fun to work with. In Online Grocery Pick up, it can get really busy and crowded when there is a lot of orders for the hour, but with the the right people it can be exciting and a breeze. Management mostly stays in the shadows and there would be a lot of criticism towards them, but I never really had any problems.

New Associate to Walmart,"Like Most companies Walmart stands out based on its sheer size and volume.  The amount of work that is available sometimes outweighs the amount of people to do the required tasks.  For Me Walmart is a perfect opportunity. I am able to have something to do all the time because I like to stay busy and I am able to pickup shifts at other stores that need help because staffing is constantly changing.  With Volume and size does come a few cons, that I believe all companies deal with on a daily basis.  Balancing the work/life balance can be hard with such extreme demands on the workload.  As management changes for the better, there are stresses involved with transitions.  The new Teaming structure will work for this company with time, and I do believe I should have been with Walmart many many years ago.  ",5,Current Employee,Associate ,"Atlanta, GA",2/8/21,2021,2,8
"Easy Job, Minus Management","The job is overall easy and not hard. I was a Customer Availability Process Associate, or CAP2 Associate.

I'd Definitely Find A Different Location to Work At,"Management is HORRIBLE!!! No one trains you then whdn you do something wrong they yell and criticize you threating to fire you. Worst Walmart Ive ever worked for! The customers are disgusting and have no manners leaving items they dont want everywhere. Dropping food and the ground and constantly stealing.

Unproductive ,I've worked at two walmarts in two different states. Management is horrible.  There is no communication between managers. Managers aren't up to date on major police's. It is literally like high school. ,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Hanson, KY",2/4/21,2021,2,4
Favoritism ,They want you to bust your butt so they don’t have to. They have there click that they walk around and talk with all day long while you work. Good luck moving up without being buddies with management. You don’t start getting pto until after a year the bonuses suck and you don’t really get anything from the company. You are only allowed 4.5 point before your fired so if you have kids that is really hard given you could have to miss work out of no where because they are sick and they don’t care. The money is not that great for the work and the people you have to deal with all day long. And good luck getting full time they will work you right at the mark so you don’t classify as full time and get the benifits. Awful place to work for!! ,2,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Cleveland, GA",2/4/21,2021,2,4

Overall just work and get the job done itll be a good exp,Do not get involved with any drama situation. Walmart has like a high school drama. Best advice stick to your self. Dont trust no one. I did maintenance  3rd shift it was easy and laid back. All cleaning. You'll either scrub grocery or general merchandise with a machine. Or You'll be on chores. Basically bathrooms trash and special little projects. Like cleaning certain areas. If you stick to yourself and do your job you will have no problem. Stay out of drama situations it spreads fast.  If you want more hours ask the manager tell them your situation and they will give you some more hours. Be reliable and you will be good. ,5,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Bartow, FL",2/4/21,2021,2,4

When my hours as a cashier got cut, they transferred my primary back to Crafts & Fabrics so I could get the hours I needed.

Its so hard to get rid of the points and ultimately set up to use the employees energy to the last drop and then some.,2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,Pennsylvania,2/4/21,2021,2,4
There is no good for this place.,This place was an absolute wreck to work at. Of course there’s usually managers who aren’t great and others you like more than anyone else but that wasn’t the case. I showed up on time or early left late if needed. Moved departments when needed and they yet refused to schedule me after an incident OUTSIDE of work with family and one of the managers. They basically had a falling out and due to that the manager refused to schedule me. And refused to let me take over someone else’s shift. Walmart Managers only cared for themselves and not their employees. I struggled to make bills and had medical issues that couldn’t get taken care of because I wasn’t able to afford it due to not working really at all.

It was a decent job,The lube tech position was a fairly simple job. Your day consisted of oil changes and tire changes with the occasional tire repair or valve cleaning service. Even though you were a tech you were expected to be a cashier and shel stocker as well. Management was okay and tended to be pretty understanding. The coworkers are great and were always happy to help you with anything you may need. The only downside was the pay.

Poor work life balance ,"I've worked in many stores, both hourly and salary...Please think hard about working here if you're married, I've seen several nasty divorces due to the crazy amount of stress and poor schedule.  Work life balance is poor for salary at store level. The store manager has a template for the salary schedule but don't count on working it and be ready for lots nights and weekends. Six day work weeks are common in stores that have completely broken processes and weeks near Christmas, Thanksgiving and inventory. Don't miss any of your PTO, the company doesn't pay you for any not used and only allows 5 days to rollover the next year. Take advantage of hourly associates knowledge, they will help you win. The company has a lot of moving parts so adaptability is very important. Working here can be very hard, frustrating, and demanding. The salary is competitive and the advancement opportunities are available. ",2,Former Employee,"Business Lead, coach ","Atlanta, GA",2/3/21,2021,2,3

Decent job with pretty solid benefits but.....,"The people I was hired with as in the distribution center associates were all fine, no one of the associates was rude and when they needed help with something they were grateful to receive the help, but the thing that this job really rubbed me the wrong way was that you had to uphold a packing average, fine nothing wrong with having standards, but the managers and leads,1 of them were great she was understanding and didn't look down to you, the others though were either talking to each other the entire time or just lollygagging even when the conveyer belt had issues over and over again they didn't even notice and associates had to deal with it, when I was unable to hit the average in only my second week of working there, they had a lead who really couldn't care less; ask me about my average and then said he would do a follow up, he did this 2 times and never had the follow up at the end of the shift either time, I thought I was fine, they ended up getting someone to threaten to fire me if I didn't pick it up and I decided that I couldn't care as much as they wanted me to so I left and quit the next day. Oh and during a regular shift after standing for 90% of it you get two 15 minute breaks",3,Former Employee,Distribution Associate ,"Bethlehem, PA",2/3/21,2021,2,3

One of the best companies I have ever had the opportunity to work with. ,"The company is amazing and does great things for it's employees, the nearby community ( donations to the homeless shelters and food banks, closing the store in order to deep clean for covid to keep it's customer and employees safe when there was a spike in cases in the area despite the loss of revenue speaks volumes), and for our environment ( recycling of produce instead of just adding to a landfill).The Albert Pike location where I was in Hot Springs  was a family atmosphere. I have seen this first hand by them checking in on other employees as well as myself when things came up. While I can't speak for the other locations, I can speak for store the store I was with... I would say that if you want a job where you are seen as a person, would like a chance to advance, be fulfilled when you clock out and go home at the end of the day, and are around people who have a desire to see a person succeed, then apply.

They don’t care about you or the corona virus.,"They punish you for calling out if your sick . Even with a whole virus going on they still want you to work. All they do it tell lies about how they want to keep people safe but you’ll also get a point if you’re sick and you don’t come in or leave early. Numerous people have caught corona and they just swept it under the rug. On top of that the managers are lazy, you’re over worked and under paid and they don’t care about anything personal going on. All they care about is what you do for them. You could be the best worker and they will treat you like you’re nothing  if you do something they don’t like.

Managers are the biggest issue,"Almost all of the management team at my location were chosen because of their closeness to the store manager and not on their actual effectiveness, worked in what should have been the easiest department (OGP) and with proper duties and roles being known and assigned it would have been. Instead they just let everyone come in and do whatever they want until someone starts failing then they take 99% of the team and put them on that task until the others fail and move everyone over to the other parts. The people getting left after those 99% go to whatever is failing are always the best workers and they end up having to do a teams job all by themselves most of the time. The asm over OGP at my store fired people once they knew they would put in a 2 week notice so they wouldn't mess up the turnaround, regardless of the fact we needed all the bodies we could get. not that you would know until you've worked your whole day anyways.

At Walmart, I have been pleasantly surprised that, while they do have high employee turn-over rates, there is a fair-sized cadre of experienced, seasoned career associates. After new associate orientation classes, there are plenty of skills development videos and classes, some mandatory, some elective.

Good for part time hours,It was a good place for someone looking for only 10 to 20 hours a week. Rarely was anyone given more than that outside of management. Promotions were hard to come by and managers could be transferred with little to no notice.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Greenville, PA",2/2/21,2021,2,2

"Easy work, good people, but not very good mangement","The job itself is fine. It keeps you busy until you clock out. You quickly learn your job and other useful skills to make your job easier. Management is probably the biggest problem to most stores. They're either not there when you need them or on you when you don't. They lack skills to communicate with employees on issues that need to be handled or just don't. You will be pulled from your main work to either help with something urgent or to do another departments work. The overall workplace is nice, nice people to work with as well as the customers. Customers aren't as bad you think. But you soon see things different once you see what some employees deal with and changes the way you shop at stores.

Walmart,"For starters, management had quit the very same week that I was hired...Yipee! And we had no management over my department for the last 3 months. We tried our best to work with each other but the Shift Manager would scramble our shifts and sometimes we would not have a closer nor opener for our department. This wasn't only us though.

Was ok at first,"The first year of employment went ok then walmart started making a bunch of changes to 3rd shift and forcing employees to stay after their shift to finish unfinished tasks until done no matter how long it would take to finish, then you where expected to stay after to work in other areas until those tasks where completed.

Joy-sucking workplace ,"I wouldn't recommend working here unless you absolutely have to.

They overwork you. ,When I first started it wasn’t that bad. But they claim to accommodate to what an employee needs which isn’t the case. They told me they’d love me to cashier because the job was too much on my back but instead they kept pushing it back until they eventually said they can’t move me because people kept quitting because the management pushes too hard and just yells 24/7.

Bad management & chaotic workplace. ,"Many employees sit around & do nothing while others rush to get things done. Managers are absolutely no help & add no contribution or value to the store. They would walk around the store gossiping in a group then go outside every 15 minutes for a cigarette, while treating employees unfairly. Also, don’t expect for them to accommodate to your schedule. Didn’t handle the pandemic well at all, & when people actually did catch COVID-19, they would be frustrated with the employee for not coming in. Also, only a 10% discount on taxed items, which usually saved me only about $3 while spending $50-60",2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Plainfield, IN",2/1/21,2021,2,1

Managment and Health,"At most stores the management isn't good at all. The amount of health code violations there is absolutely absurd. They refuse to acknowledge the problems that are apparent.

Alright to work for depending on the store,"If you are at a store with managers who actually know what they are doing and communicate it's not terrible, however it's a lot of work, you hardly get recognized for the work and management at times can be unbearable. Customers will always come up to you asking where something is or if something is in stock or if you're close by somewhere like electronics they will ask for help. There's little job security, positions are changed around constantly i.e. all previous hourly supervisory positions are being eliminated for team leads that are basically the old support manager. You can be an excellent supervisor or employee and if they don't like you they'll get rid of you.

There is no way to get it done. Managers don't care if there are only 2 of you, but the work has to get done. Don't expect managers to give you a hand because they won't. They just sit in the office all day and come out every so often to make it look as if they are doing something.

Be prepared to work 7-9 days in a row if they mess with your schedule then all the sudden decide to change it back for whatever reason because it’s happened to me on more than one occasion.

"Hard work, full of stress","The Walmart DC is easily one of the hardest and most stressful job I had. I was excited because I needed work and money but it wasn't worth the months of stress and physical toll. If you're desperate and willing to work, it's the place for you.

They claim to have flexible work hours but they do NOT have flexible hours. You are unable to have a work/home/life balance.

Worst Place I've Ever Worked,I would NEVER recommend anyone to work here. I actually warn against it. I was constantly belittle by management and customers. Had to work through breaks.

The worst employer I have ever worked for.,"Walmart does not care about their employees. All they care about is the almighty $1 and how they can achieve it, whether it be right or wrong.

Would be decent if management actually did their job,"At least in my location, my Walmart has a terrible management team. We have huge turnover rates in Cap 2 and the front end because all of the team leads are mean and lazy. Even the way they talk to customers sometimes amazes me because I already know that if I ever got caught talking to a customer like that I'd probably be fired on the spot. Retail can obviously be really stressful and there are always going to be rude customers, but this job genuinely would not be that bad if the managers and team leads actually treated us like humans.",1,Current Employee,Front End Cashier ,"Manhattan, KS",1/30/21,2021,1,30

"The lack of competent, professional leadership ","Fine if you're a floor associate and like being told what to do by MANY different supervisory staff...but if you want to advance,  be prepared to work yourself to death.

"Great place, but such a let down.","I have worked as an automotive technician at Walmart  for going on 3 years now and things started out great, but quickly fell into the trash soon after. The work environment is great. The people I work work is such a joy, but the manager requires you to kiss his butt which is something I refuse to do. Ones in his little favorites group get to walk around all day on their phones and stay huddled up together laughing and playing all day  while others do all of the work.",1,Current Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Country Club Hills, IL",1/30/21,2021,1,30
The people i worked with,"Wal mart was a decent place to work for until the last 2 managers who did not care for the associates .They were out for there own personal gains and would not listen to reason. Then there was when they changed the attendance policy which didn't protect the employees and for the employees that lived out of town in snowmelt areas that got docked a point because they could not make it to work on time or not at all because they roads were untraceable.         The one that really gets my goat is how they changed alot of there policies on if you left for a emergency 2 hours before your shift was up you get docked a hole point. Example:I left 3 hours early to go to emergency room to find out why I was sick that counted as 1 point on my attendance,  which I found out I had kidney stones. My favorite  change they made was if you are out for 3 days you have to have a docters excuse to come back to work and it only counted as 1 point but they changed the policy to 4 days and they gave me 3 points on my attendance.

People are great. Job is simple. Just terrible management ,"The coworkers are all great and fun people to be around. Some of the managers are cool but most are always complaining and never help to fix the issues. They just walk around and look for things to complain about. The company worries more about what people wear than hiring more help to get the store back in great shape. The work isn’t hard to get the hang of and pretty easy if you like hands on and fast paced work, just annoying management.",3,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Durham, NC",1/30/21,2021,1,30

"Great Job, Motivating Managers, So So Coworkers  ","The managers here are amazing and they actually care about their employees. It’s still customer first as is most retail  jobs, but when the customer is clearly in the wrong or harassing or bullying a employee they will stand up for the employee and take the employees side which is nice and from my experience quite rare. My managers also go out of their way to make sure we all are doing well with our jobs, to work with our schedule and availability, and to make sure we have what we need for our job. They’re also pretty good about being understanding when the store is busy and etc. The calling in sick and being late, personally I think is a bit strict. But that isn’t exactly on them, but I think all of Walmart like it sounds reasonable but life happens and especially with covid like it’s better to be safe than sorry but there’s only so much you can do when life comes up or family stuff and you can’t go into work or your a bit late due to weather, kid barfing, etc. Thankfully so far they’ve been pretty helpful with this even still I hope they change this and make it less strict. Instead of 5 points maybe like 10 would be better for a 6 month period. Coworkers on the other hand, aren’t all the most friendly. Some are very nice, most so far are not. Not In the slightest. I don’t know for all departments either. It may be different. There is a ton of over time opportunities, which isn’t bad if you have time or want/need the money. Otherwise not always fun when balancing like school or other plans and home life. Usually they’re still understanding though. Scheduling sometimes - more...",5,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Falcon, CO",1/29/21,2021,1,29
"Nepotism, unfair, unwilling to work with associates, etc.","I loved my job starting out. I worked in a specific department for over a year, and then I was told that I had to work somewhere else and get a pay cut even though some of the people that were chose to work in in my original department had no experience. Since COVID, I have been forced to stand at the front door most days in the cold and heat. Management was alright before they switched to team leads so now there are too many people with power and not enough regular associates. Most of the team leads have let all the power get to their heads and overuse and abuse their positions. This is an okay job if you are willing and able to put up with people who are difficult to get along with. Most of the customers are nice and friendly, it's just the employees that you have to worry about. They usually only hire people that they know or one of the associates know. That whole place is full of drama, and team leads are some of the reason for that. I, personally, feel like the place is a hostile work environment. If you report the store to the ethics hotline, there is retaliation even though there isn't supposed to be. It is also very difficult to get days off and to get a set availability schedule. You can't move up in the company unless you suck up to management. You are expected to do other people's jobs even if you have your own tasks to do.

They pay is great but hours vary,The pay at Walmart is very competitive with companies in the area. But with about every company there is a busy season and a slow season.

There is a lot of work and time fly for a good worker.,Not all the captains or group leader are the same. Some need training before they aspire to become a good assistant manager candidates.

Okay place to work if you want a part time job ,"Great job for those who only need a part time job. However, if you need a full time job and have bills and a family to provide for this job is a no no. At times you will get a decent schedule which will be 35-40 hours and a lot of times you’ll be lucky if you can get 20 hours a week. Management tells you to open up your availability so that you can get as much hours as possible but that’s not true.

Opportunities for Advancement ,I’ve been at Walmart for four years . Started off as a regular associates and am now a Team Lead. The pay is good you get a raise every year. You receive PTO and PPTO .

Good and Bad,"good pay for decent work, depending on the department the managers can be rather disrespectful and prioritize things that would only benefit the managers themselves, for example; a manager once an employee to LIE about an objective that was supposed to be attended to by the manager but instead had an employee take the blame as if he (the manager) had made it a priority and the acting employee would be portrayed as lazy and insubordinate.",3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Lewisburg, TN",1/28/21,2021,1,28

Great treatment goes along way with employees.,"I wish Walmart would treat their workers better,I know a lot of long term employees that had to leave because of poor treatment.

"Find a position you enjoy, the Work can drain you","First off, Walmart can be a great place for people. Most of the time it is a employee and customer centered atmosphere with plenty of freedom. If you can find a position you love and can handle stressful situations, great for you and the many people that stay at Walmart to retirement. For me, I struggled with the bigger picture, the things that your managers can't change such as schedule restrictions, quotas, and obscene rules. The distribution center is especially horrible; the only good thing about the warehouse jobs is the pay. If you can find a job that interests you, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the work outside of some of the bigger corporate blunders.

Fast paced hard work,Used to be a great place to work. I put 17 years in and this last year has been terrible it's been restructure after restructure I'm sure it makes good business sense but it's horrible for the employees. As far as I'm concerned it's never enough for them. As far as benefits the benefits are great if you have been with the company for a long time. Not sure how it works for the newcomers. I was under so much stress anxiety and had so much anger and resentment that I finally had to throw in the towel and I resigned a little over 17 years worth of employment with them. I was hoping to make it to 20. I really don't have much good to say about them anymore. I'm sure Sam Walton's rolling over in his grave the way they treat Associates.

They didn't care that I was coughing like crazy and couldn't stand up without feeling dizzy. I asked to leave early and they told me if I did I would be fired. Terrible terrible job.

Very confrontational and toxic environment,"Wouldn't recommend.

Bad place to work.,"The wages are not competitive with other grocery chains.  The yearly raise is only 2% so you really cannot make a living wage from working here.

Good pay but poor management ,"Good pay with benefits 401k and bonuses per quarter. Non existent HR department and they do not follow covid protocols. (People not wearing masks or social distancing especially in office). Some good people to work with but all management care about is numbers and product out the door. Not a clean or safe work environment, OSHA violations are very common but walmart can afford to pay the fines. People get hurt alot and a big turnover with hiring and firing especially around slow season. (November to March). I'm sure the stores are slightly better than distrubution centers. Do not buy expensive electronics from here as damaged product is often sent to stores. ",1,Former Employee,Walmart Distribution Center ,"Loveland, CO",1/27/21,2021,1,27
Always busy ,"This is the only walmart out there so its always busy. Cashiering is ok until you get rude customers. Management there slacks on lunch/breaks and fail to remember getting simple change when needed at your register. Some employees just dont even come back when you come to cover their break so youre stuck checking receipts all day. You apply for a certain position and think you would stay there? No, managers would pull employees to spray carts, cart push, count customers, and etc... Dont get paid enough to do all that. Only benefit was getting a $100 bonus to paychecks once in a while.

Productive and great place to work,"Other than one supervisor,with whom I didn't get along with, I had a great work experience.

"Good workplace culture, low hours, good pay",The pay is getting better but they cut hours so that you really don't make much more.

Not the place for me,"Working at Walmart was cool at first, but you learn how they operate very quickly. Team could be swamped with orders and running behind then all of a sudden a manager comes and tells one of your coworkers they need to go home because they are about to hit overtime. Leaving everyone else to have to pick up the slack. Helicopter management watches every little thing you do. Was never able to have any sort of rapport with coworkers because anytime you're seen talking is seen as slacking.

All they care about is production,All Walmart DC cares about is production. I worked weekend shift(4th shift). None of the managers care about you. They expect you to work very hard no matter what. The 2 week training is not helpful. They give you light freight to train with. Then whenYour out of training they hit you with heavy freight and they expect you to move that heavy freight with the same effort you would with light freight. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. They only reason the pay is good is because they know you won’t last long. They also show favorites to some employees. ,1,Former Employee,Shipping and Receiving ,"Port Wentworth, GA",1/27/21,2021,1,27
Self training,"There is very little hands on training before they throw to the wolves. Most times Management won't answer calls or pages. They depend on hourly associates to answer their calls.

Overworked and questionable management,"The interview process went well and after that is when it became frustrating. There really wasn’t any training even when they knew it was my first job, co-workers who got out an hour early wouldn’t even work. They would just stack their work onto yours.For example, one person isn’t suppose to unload the truck EVERYDAY sweaty and drained then go stock shelves  in front of customers. The Managers were useless and very rude, they didn’t fix our schedules whatsoever. ",3,Current Employee,Walmart Associate ,"Plainview, TX",1/27/21,2021,1,27

A typical day consisted of checking in and staying at the cashier waiting for people. I learned how to use cashier and self-checkout machines. Management was pretty chill. The culture was decent.

"Great teams, company lacks direction",The company has ever changing direction on how they want tasks done. Different levels of upper management has different goals that don’t always align to the next level up or down.

Would not recommend this workplace to anyone.,"I had to quit. I was trying to move out of my department, because they kept trying to get me in trouble for stuff other people were not doing. I was tired of being the only one in my dept (with a team of about 7 people) doing everything. I had to basically babysit grown men. Dept manager not doing anything, i found my self doing a lot of the work he was supposed to be doing. There is definitely favoritism.  They push the people that work hard and exceed, to work harder and do other people's job's.  And let the lazy be lazy. If they see you are a hard working, self motivated person, they will keep you where you are at, and if you want to move up or move to another dept, they will do everything to keep you where you are at.

Good pay. Awful scheduling/management,"The pay was decent as was the amount of hours. Even at part time, they gave me around 38 hours a week. Training was limited to computer training and one shift with a trainer. After that, you’re on your own. Scheduling was awful. Constantly scheduled to close and then open the next day.

Good If You Really Need A Job,"It's basic retail, what you expect is what it is. You have to deal with rude customers and management that is always scrambling around the store. Like any other job, you have co-workers and managers you like but even then that's not enough to make you enjoy your work. It's repetitive work, and even if you are part-time they will likely give you just under full time hours unless you specifically ask for less hours (even then the system still can sneak you in more hours than you ask).",3,Former Employee,Store Associate ,"Huntington Beach, CA",1/26/21,2021,1,26

about what youd expect,"It's walmart, so of course pay is low, turnover is high, management is unhelpful, and even documented agreements are not kept.

Productive work,"ORIGINALLY:The pay was pretty good as were the benefits but they are strict and not very understanding to emergencies, but to be fair all their employee systems are automated so sometimes the issues are out of their hands. I started off at Orange Beach and that was a great experience, BUT the moment I moved to Tillmans Corner my experience went south. The managers are not helpful and will outright avoid helping employees and even customers, and I had to call everyday for a week straight to ever get in touch with HR.

Mentally exhausting but a good experience,"This is not a horrible job, its easy to learn and do, coworkers and managers are generally supportive but it is mostly the company culture itself that makes the job unbearable. There is little to no support coming from corporate when it comes to major problems such as harassment. The company keeps making stupid rules that only make our lives harder. Everyone (including managers) are heavily underpaid. However, what you're learning there is good, you learn a lot very quickly, and coworkers are generally nice.TLDR: People and work good, company and pay bad.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"San Diego, CA",1/26/21,2021,1,26

Stressful and irritating,"I think it depends on which Wal-Mart you work in. But the one i work at specifically is not worth the $11 an hour. At least not for a long time. The stress is unnecessary and the new changes to the management of the store doesn't help. You get hired expecting you're going to work the hours you asked for, but if you're trying to make enough to live, good luck. They cut your hours so bad if you're a part time associate that you go from 25+ hours to 16- hours a week. Not to mention they do not listen to your availability requests. I'm starting college back and put in a request for availability change forever ago. But surprise surprise, it hasn't taken place with less than a week left before school. In fact, it's gotten worse. People talk about you behind your back. It's difficult to do any work because the store won't supply necessary tools to its associates. Not to mention that with us being in a pandemic, a lot of associates have come down with covid-19. But does the store care? Probably not since we're still operating without changing anything. Anyway. Yeah money is good when you've got it.",2,Current Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Whiteville, NC",1/26/21,2021,1,26
Lots of work for not a lot of pay,"Personally, I like to stay busy while at work and if you work at Walmart you will be constantly busy. I don't feel that Walmart hires enough people to do everyday work effectively. The people that they do hire can be hit or miss like any job. Upper management can be a revolving door and is also hit or miss. I've had great managers who leave me alone let me do my work and others who will have two hour long meetings everyday and wonder why you can't do your job. Starting pay was around $11 when I left. Department Manager pay was $13.50. They did have quarterly bonuses when you achieved certain goals. Overall, it was only OK. I would only suggest doing this for a short term",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Greenwood, SC",1/26/21,2021,1,26

Loved most coworkers ,I loved my job at Walmart but being a single mother with 3 kids and no family support is very hard you get a point if you have to leave early due to yourself or child being sick even if you have a dr excuse they don’t want to see it nor will they take it if you give it to them. I was 2 weeks from being taken off temporary status to full time and got a call 45 minutes before work saying they had to let all the temps go just to find out the next day from a delivery driver they had a new girl being trained.

Good place.,If you can get passed your probationary period of employment youll do fine.

They still expected me to pull pallets of freight weighing 500-1500 lbs, which you shouldn’t do while pregnant especially when in my case I was considered high risk.

Managers lie and work is ridiculous,The majority of the jobs are hard manual labor with an ever increasing quota to meet. The managers lie to the employees to make them work harder/more hours. The managers will shut you out and make your job difficult if they don't like you. The pay and benefits are good for somebody with no experience/education. The coworkers (not managers) are generally friendly.,1,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Sutherland, VA",1/24/21,2021,1,24

It's a starter job with plenty of issues,Department managers don't care about about other departments. Seems to be a general lack of teamwork mentality all around the store. Expected to work around broken shelving and displays with less than the minimum amount of workers required in a short amount of time. Managers pick and choose when they will deal with customers and customer complaints leaving base level associates to deal with the issue.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Stocker ,"1955 E Montgomery Cross Rd Savannah, Ga 31404",1/24/21,2021,1,24

It is what you make of it,I worked at Walmart for a little over 2 years it was not that bad but at the same time it was not that great. They're not so crazy about you coming in late which makes sense because if you ever get close to having overtime they will be sure to cut you. Like with any job it's really what you make of it you have good managers and bad managers and you're always going to be busy if you work late shift like me definitely be sure to be tired and not have so much of a daytime life. ,3,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Missouri City, TX",1/23/21,2021,1,23
not fun anymore,"More communication between management and employees.  there used to be daily/weekly meetings and now there are only meetings for the department managers/team leaders and we are left out of the loop.  too much hippocracy.  customers are allowed to be: arrogant, rude, judgemental and at times destructive.  we can't say anything, not even in a joking manner in fear of offending.  we can't defend ourselves, when we call, for management, they are not available to defuse the situation and 9/10 times, they believe the customer first.  it used to be fun to work there.  now, not so much.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Greensboro, NC",1/23/21,2021,1,23

I see a lot of old people not wanting things to change in the store and in life that won’t help you here. And also new people, young or even teenagers wasting opportunities being lazy or not worrying about atttendace being terminated. Also some people don’t want to advance because of the workload or stress involved not realizing the lower the pay, the harder physical work and stress is part of any job, even minimum wage.",4,Current Employee,Asset Protection Specialist ,"Tucson, AZ",1/23/21,2021,1,23

Constant work but no support from above,"The work is not awful and hard, easy to pick up on and run with. Management can be frustrating to work under at times. There are many issues both within the department and throughout the store that are common annoyances and problems for associates that just seem as though they may never be fixed, making it hard to get up and go to work in the mornings.

Team orientation ,"Walmart does not offer work, family life balance. Your schedule is not flexible. You miss many important aspects of life working for this company. You loose respect. On the other hand the authentic family oriented environment created with support groups is like a halfway house into financial literacy if you’re in the prime of blooming into the work Industry. Walmart is not recommended for injured, pregnant, incompetent, intelligent individuals. Walmart does require alcoholic beverages be stocked by specific non alcoholic venders. So is the rye bread. There has proven to be a difference in the two companies sams club and Walmart stocking policy because Walmart offers better quality for more dollar but less quantity. However on the other hand sams club is opposite sams club offers more quantities for less quality which means less work is expected of workers.

Working in the south is like working with ex cons,"I worked for Walmart in the south. I worked for 3 different store. Each store has to come up with a sales forecast for the year and that would determine the number of hours for the employees to work. Every single store grossly and purposefully underestimated their sales forecast and left their own store without enough hours to complete basic operations. The store managers did this to maximize their year end bonus. They were encouraged to do this. Working at these stores was terrible. There was never enough people to do the basic stuff. And because sales were so much higher than forecast we would always catch the attention of the regional managers wanted to check out our stores and see how awesome we were. We would then have to work overtime pairing the store to cover up the fraud. And because we were salary of course we were not paid for our overtime. The only hourly employees that we could retain we’re terrible at their jobs. They work there because I couldn’t find any other place to work and with daily pushed us to fire them. They simply did not care. And to be honest it was the appropriate response. I understand some Walmarts up north function perfectly because they don’t have corrupt managers trying to maximize their year end bonus. But here in the south it is pretty much every Walmart I go to. Every Walmart is messy, the employees aren’t doing anything, and nothing is stocked. And it’s all because those managers also underestimated their sales forecast that undercut their hours budget just to get a big year end bonus. The bonuses were big. Really big, but it was not fair - more...",1,Former Employee,ASM ,North Carolina,1/23/21,2021,1,23
They don't care about you,"The managers do whatever they want,  they never get reprimanded.

Fortune 1 for a reason,I worked for Walmart for 5 years and during that time I had the opportunity to learn from and meet many noteworthy individuals.

O/N Team lead,Typical night as an associate is to stock your area of freight with in a certain amount of time depending how much there is to stock in the department. Quick advancement to lead positions only if you put in the work for it as well gain as much knowledge as possible beforehand. Good support system from the company from coach to lead down to the team members. As long as you ask as many questions and put in the work you're bound to have a good job security. Benefits are okay but not the best but after 3 months you'll get a discount card for in-store shopping. If you need a specific schedule bst advice is to ask for it during orientation not in application fill out then you'll never get hired but they are flexible except on holidays and key dates.,3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker/Team lead ,"Lubbock, TX",1/22/21,2021,1,22

The uniform is laid back which is amazing for someone who wants to be able to dress and style themselves how they want to. However, when I finally was able to work there I was happy with my job for one day. The managers had horrible attitudes. I only had one manager who was always nice. The benefits they offer are only for employees who work there for longer than three months. You cannot take an FMLA leave unless you have worked there for a year or have worked a certain amount of hours. You don’t get your employee discount unless you’ve been working there for three months. The point system is absolute trash. You don’t get any sick days. You can’t use your PTO or PPTO unless you’ve worked there for three months. The point system shouldn’t even be a thing because we’re in the middle of a global pandemic. Your availability is set in place for three months unless you have a valid reason for changing like you are working at another job or if it’s for school. The employee break room was always dirty.

But i had previous injuries start to hurt some from when i was in the military. I tried to talk to the managers about it and they were rude to me acting like i was making it up and was exaggerating the whole thing.

Treat employees poorly,"Walmart has few qualities that redeem it as a company, but obviously the experience will differ from location to location. A typical day in my position had me standing in the same spot for hours with no sitting allowed, and a single break since I was only part-time. I was rarely allowed to move out of view of CSM's, even if my duties also stated that I help to keep the entryway clear of carts left there by customers. I would often be reprimanded for doing something as normal as using the restroom. Training days were what I looked forward to the most, because I could take a generous portion of my shift to actually, you know, sit.What I learned was... how to clean up spills. But in the most convoluted and time consuming way possible. There were occasional training courses that were informative, such as how to deal with active shooters in the workplace, injuries on the job, etc., but most of them were unnecessary and almost looked like they were intended for use by children under the age of 10. Outside of training, there wasn't much to learn really. The store I worked at was rife with issues in upper management, which resulted in different managers being put in charge of different departments as often as every single week. All of them had different ideas of how we should do things, and because I was a greeter I didn't fall into any specific department other than front-end, which meant every manager acted as though I was under their jurisdiction and had me off doing things that weren't in my job description.Workplace culture at my store was demoralizing at best.

I took some courses in college on Enterprise Architecture and It seems like no one at Workday had ever done any such research before they decided to cut off the blood flow to the major organs of the store. I do want to go back but from a educated point of view I feel bad for all the people still working there because they did not give enough help to each department .

After 10 months of working back there, I decided to move over to Electronics to work with a schedule that would complement my school schedule. When the pandemic hit, I decided to work at Walmart full time and that's when I started to see some of its flaws. The management there, while can be good in some aspects, do not like to be accountable for anything. This leads to a lot of the associates getting in trouble for things that may not have been communicated thoroughly. Upper management do not communicate with each causing a very disorganized work day. When your department head is working, the day goes smoothly. He/She makes all the decision and the work day seems like it becomes streamlined.

It's walmart bad place to work but we'll paid,It's a bad place to work but if you can swing it there is money to be made.

"Great benefits and medical, poor backing from higher levels of management and office personnel.","A decent place to work for the most part. Policies can change rapidly, generally for the worst as corporate passes down edicts that seem to make no sense or makes things worse. Mid level supervisors and management seem to play more politics than actual work at times. Typical drama and idiocy can run rampant. Occasionally caught between impossible standards and overbearing timelines, associates struggle to just make it work. Even with medical proof, such as a Doctor's writ or the like, You can be censured for missing work. Part time associates seem to either get barely any hours, or more than they had originally asked for with no middle ground. Commonly placed or cross-trained into other areas to fill coverage gaps.Great benefits and education abilities. Occasional chances at advancement within the company. Pay is fairly decent for the more rural areas, allowing a good living wage.",4,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Huntingdon, PA",1/22/21,2021,1,22
Bad,Management does not care about their employees. They put on an act when the big bosses are visiting after that some of them are very rude and inconsiderate. ,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service/Sales Associate ,Florida,1/22/21,2021,1,22
The Walmart I'm at is GREAT!,The team I work with are great! I've really enjoyed working here and I've learned a lot about myself here.

Most jobs are easy and wages reflect that.,The entry level jobs at Walmart are easy and relatively stress free. The work can be fast-paced at times but rarely difficult. The worst part of Walmart is arguably the pay and annual raises. I would also say there can be a serious lack of communication between salaried management and hourly associates. ,4,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,Minnesota,1/21/21,2021,1,21
It's alright,"Management is ok, communication is poor though. Goals are unclear unless your not going to make them. Poor training. Left alone to do my job with little training and no supervision.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Kennewick, WA",1/21/21,2021,1,21

They don't care about your safety,"I work in the online grocery department and despite being in the middle of a pandemic where case numbers are nearly doubling every day, nobody at Walmart ever feels it necessary to inform associates when one of their co-workers tests positive, despite corporate policy mandating they have to do so. Walmart doesn't care at all about associate safety in the current climate. if you're looking for a job in an essential sector, look elsewhere",1,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,California,1/21/21,2021,1,21
Refusal to make loyal employees full time,Walmart doesn't want to make people full time. They will schedule you 5 days a week for 26-30 hours a week. Wasting time and gas. If you get up and go to work 5 days a week you should get 40 hours. Their pay raises aren't very good either ,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Roanoke, AL",1/21/21,2021,1,21

Stressful and poorly managed,"Working here for 3 years was the most stressful three years of my life.  Each and every day I left work, I didn't know if I would be returning.  Management was more horrible than the job itself.  There was no culture, it was every person for themselves.  Being a part of a click was important or you would be left out.  If you were quiet and too yourself, then you were a problem.  The hardest part of this job was showing up every day and the most enjoyable part was leaving.  In addition to that, the CEO and others directly under him are HEARTLESS.  When they got rid of the Accounts Payable positions, they invited us to clock out for the day, show up at CPCC and they took 1 minute and 25 seconds to tell us we no longer had a job.  They do not care about their employees.",1,Former Employee,Accounting Specialist III ,"Charlotte, NC",1/21/21,2021,1,21
productive,"Typical work day in Walmart, is your daily task assigned by the Manager. Sometime you have days when work is fairly easy except holidays or Sundays.

Great workplace with friendly people,My first full time job and probably my best job I’ve ever had. Most of my coworkers were extremely friendly along with my managers who treated me like a friend and rarely a puppet for them to string me around. I knew when to work and when I could talk to someone about stuff. Overall a very nice environment if you can set aside conversation and get the job done when you need to. ,4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Gaylord, MI",1/21/21,2021,1,21
Benefits and wages are good hours and management 👎,"If you don't mind working every single weekend and nights then your good. But if you are a single parent I would make sure you put specific days and hours you are available. You will never get to see your child. They get out of school at 3, your at work until at least 8 pm to 11pm. I was never given a weekend off in my 2 and a half years there without requesting it off or calling out. They play favorites. Store manager would rarely speak to you unless they wanted something done or to complain... Promote people who aren't qualified and come to work late everyday. Expect you to do the jobs of 4 or 5 people. ",3,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Ft. Meyers, FL",1/21/21,2021,1,21
Worst place ever ,If I could rate 0 or negative stars I would. Don’t work here if you value yourself. It’s the worst. I was treated bad. Never had respect. Basically was looked down on. Managers were best friends but non stop laughed at the associates that struggled or tried their best. They work you till you have nothing and never get sick because they will not let you leave or take off without threatening your job. Oh by the way they don’t take doc notes ,1,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"North East, MD",1/21/21,2021,1,21
Fun people to work with but very stressfup and fast paced. ,"The people were fun to work with in the Pharmacy and after working for 5 other pharmacies it was one of the better companies. Cooperate management is a joke, huge expectations and goals that aren't reachable. Pharmacy Tech is a good starting job if you want a career in Pharmacy but no growing within unless you want a dollar raise to be the head tech. People that get mad at you because they think all you do is put pills in a bottle and slap a label on it, should only take 2 min. Great Pharmacy manager and staff pharmacist. The other techs were great too. Pay was somewhat competitive. Started out in pharmacy 12 years ago making 11.50/hr and now new techs are making a couple dollars less than what i make now.

Very Hard Work Hard on the Body ,I worked at the distribution  center. The work is very physical unless you are very luck and they are in need of a mid level position how ever they promote from with in so you will most likely start in either shipping or receiving these are the two hardest most physical position in the facility I can not suggest which is better some people like each one over the other I was in shipping. Most people can move to a new position after a year if you have perfect attendance make no mistake you will work hard and be held to account in any position its a good company I am older so it really was hard on my body if your younger you can move up if you can make at the start  ,3,Former Employee,Shipping Associate ,"Sanger, TX",1/21/21,2021,1,21

I started off with my work schedule being front half of the week (Wed-sat) and the all of my managers and shift leads were great to work with, professional and genuinely made you feel care for and appriciated anytime they interacted with me.. I cannot say that i felt that way one bit about the magagers after i switched to the back half of the week shift (Sun-Wed) by the 2 week after i had switched shifts i knew i had made a big mistake by ever switching... my lead managers had no good leadership skills or people skills, never jumped into help us lower employees when we were struggling, and loved the chance to get onto good employees if their numbers dropped when from gold to red... i cant tell you much as far as benifits go because by time id acrually gotten access to them (which is 90days after your hired on fulltime) I had been let go due to pointing out or so they said i did... you have to really watch and stay on top of HR because they will accidently point you when you werent supposed to be due to having a doctors excuse...

Productive and fast paste,When I first started at Walmart it was very easy going as it got closer to the holidays it was just a wreck especially towards Christmas their lines are huge they usually have all registers open when they have enough cashiers there is a lot of possible overtime during the holidays there is raises with this company there is health benefits dental benefits for full-time years the only problem I would have with the company is the communication between management and associates other than that great place to work so if you like the fast paced environment then Walmart's definitely the place for you,5,Current Employee,Cake Decorator/Bakery Associate ,"Rialto, CA",1/20/21,2021,1,20
"Hit or miss, varies greatly by store.","This was my first job. It gets bad in the time leading up to holidays, but it was pretty chill from spring til the end of summer. My team leads were helpful and understanding because they were all promoted from the same position as me. I consider myself lucky for that.Management at my store wasn't all bad. I had some good managers, but we had plenty of crazy and useless ones.Every day we started our shift with a meeting to tell everyone their assignments. My team leads would always assign us to the things we were best at, so I and a few others were almost always unloading trucks, while the rest of the team were sent to stock grocery and consumables.Unloading trucks can be repetitive and physically demanding, so be ready to burn lots of calories.My co-workers were great, and I wouldn't have lasted as long as I did if I didn't make the friends I did.Black Friday and Christmas are the worst. We got more freight coming in than we were capable of stocking due to understaffing and cut hours. Management blamed it on individual performance. It brought me to tears one day when our back room was filled to the brim but we still had to unload two trucks.",2,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Yakima, WA",1/20/21,2021,1,20

Company doesnt care about the emoloyeea,The company could care less about it's employees. You are literally just a number to them. Walmart cares more about how much money they make versus the work environment you are in. There are safety violations all over the place and when you speak up you're told to shut up or you're let go.

Scheduling SUCKS ,"I really did enjoy working at Walmart, I felt like there was a lot of freedom honestly a little bit too much freedom because on some days you really didn’t know what you we’re supposed to be doing. It’s always so freaking hard to get ahold of a manager at Walmart when your needing to talk to them about something. Be prepared for your schedule to change unexpectedly, because they seem to want to add to your hours and days when you specifically told them that you couldn’t work those this day or that time. Honestly the training couldn’t be worse they pretty much just throw you in there and you just learn as you go, had to figure out a lot of things on my own and learning things that I should’ve been taught already.

So if you hire in somewhere and you realize this isn’t working out for you, too bad.  They’ll train for every position though they don’t tell you that before hand. Most of the management is cool but some are just dated from being there so long that they forgot how to talk to people respectfully. They portray a culture of tell “tell me what’s wrong and we’ll fix it” but I noticed the same things I mentioned are the same things that people mentioned that’s been there 5 years and the same for people that’s been there 10 years, in other words nothing changes. It’s a very old facility and it’s only in 2021 that they are finally adding automation. Work feels rushed and stressful because all they preach is production.

A workplace based around carrying your weight and the weight of those around you with no reward.,"I have worked at walmart in the OGP (online grocery pickup) department for close to half a year now. There are several important things that I came to learn during my time there. Management decisions will make absolutely no sense, and things will work backwards. Things will change on a whim, and you will be hounded until your team meets the goals set for you. Management is also scarce. We have no closing managers, team leads, or coaches some night. Our department manager will work until 9 some nights, but she can usually never be found. People are constantly quiting, getting fired, switching departments, or anything to get away. This leads to a constant state of chaos. You will skip all of your 15 minute breaks. Your lunch will be right when you're legally required to take it, but if they tell you to stay, expect to get a meal violation despite it being your master's fault. Walmart is somewhere you work because you have to work there. ",2,Current Employee,OGP Associate ,Ohio,1/17/21,2021,1,17
Walmart is not the place to work. ,The management has no clue. I have ask My lead manager a question and she just walked off. Most employees do not work.

Not very much advancement,"Getting in the doors is a job itself. You have to know someone to get to the interview process. As far as management a my specific location, 1174, let’s just say very unprofessional! The conversation you have with management is suppose to stay between you and management but at this location everything you said will get back to a coworker in less than 5 mins. That’s not even scratching the surface with management. UNDERPAID AND OVERWORKED is an understatement. Now regular employees do the work that department managers would usually, guess what? WITH NO RAISE. All of management and team leads get a weekend off a month guess what for regular employees? NOTHING! ",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Thomasville, AL",1/15/21,2021,1,15

You mean nothing to your management, you mean nothing to your coworkers, you mean nothing to the company. The ability to move up is nonexistent, unless you are really close to the upper level managers and you suck up to them. It’s all a favorites game. Throughout my time here, I have been threatened repeatedly by management for write ups on things I can’t control, and belittled for not completing every single additional task that gets thrown at me on top of my regular duties. To summarize: if your idea of a healthy work environment is to be made fun of, mocked, belittled, threatened, and consistently made to feel as if you do not matter, then this is that place.",1,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Woodland, WA",1/15/21,2021,1,15

Work here if you want to feel like a number,"was typically short handed to achieve daily tasks thanks to certain greedy dept managers who only care about their own necks.  working hard consistently will not get you anywhere as there is not much chance for advancement and even a job well done goes unrewarded and generally not recognized by upper management.  pay is very poor and the work is very hard.  the culture is very clique with a lot of favoritism, scandals and in-fighting between depts.  very strict rules and policies. there are some good managers and employees but its hit and miss and they include a lot of slackers and big egos.  seems they will hire and retain anyone even if they arent doing their job and then expect you to take up the slack.  they harp on about treating their employees with respect - i rarely saw it nor was it encouraged.  everyone seems to be in survival mode but on the flip side many recognized that fact and were sympathetic to one another watching each others backs so it is fair to say there is a sense of belonging and family within smaller groups/depts.   those people were my favorite part of the job as we all felt like we were in the same boat.  never worked so hard for so little while feeling so unappreciated.

Used to be a great company ,Communication skills are horrible. Short on workers with excessive freight to work but yet OT is not allowed. More concerned about overpaying employees vs customers needs. Try to communicate with Mgrs regarding issues/concerns & falls on deaf ears. Try to tell them if your goals & what you want to achieve. Falls on deaf ears. Only favorites are promoted. You’re not promoted via past/ current credentials- even if you have a college degree- they focus on their “pals” promotion instead. Demoting positions which have led to disorganized planning including cutting us off from being able to communicate with Mgt via email when it’s often the only firms of communication available. So disappointed with the way this company has changed. It is no longer considered a “family” which Sam Walton promoted. ,1,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Dickinson, ND",1/15/21,2021,1,15
I dont recommend anything walmart related.,"Walmart used to be a great company to work for. I worked there for 3 years some time ago. Back then, if you didn't worship your managers, you'd never get anywhere in the company. I quit. Several jobs later, I got desperate. A friend told me the company changed and advancement was better. I reapplied. Another 3 years go by and nothing. I decide to transfer to what I was told was a better location. I spent 2 years there being promised a promotion. In the middle of those 2 years I seen several others get promotions to the same positions I myself applied for. Each employee must stay in a position for 6 months before a promotion. One employee recieved 2 promotions in 60 days. Over the course of the same 2 years, I was consistantly left in the busiest department alone with dozens of customers. I was called names and threatened by many, simply because they had to wait a few mins because I was busy. They all wanted to speak with my manager, keeping in mind they never want to speak with angry customers, they made me tell these angry people to file their complaint on the website, which made them angrier. The complaint goes to corporate office, an email is sent to the location of the complaint, wich goes to the store manager, then given to the assistant manager to speak with me, the busy employee alone in a large department because his help was pulled to run registers at the front or to stock the stationary department.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",1/15/21,2021,1,15

I was sent to stock shelves without a handheld, not knowing where to get a one and no one else in the department that day to ask.

About what you'd expect,"Working in the back room with the trucks and what-not is about as stressful and draining as you'd expect. In general something is always causing issues that slow the job down and push back the schedule. Perhaps not all stores that have this problem, but where I work there is such a massive build up of unworked/forgotten/uneeded freight that not only does it constantly get in the way but it makes you wonder why we still get some much in every day anyway. Team leads are a mixed bag, some wanting the job done by any means and not really helping, others trying their best to help to various degrees of success, and some really just milling around being useless. In general every day puts a new spin on the same old nonsense, and at the very least you'll know as long as you're doing what you're expected to you'll have a job for as long as you can put up with it all.

Job is okay management sucks,The job it's self is not bad. It's a good temporary job. I would not suggest trying to move up. Management doesn't really appreciate their associates. They are okay with using and losing people.,2,Former Employee,Cap 2 Supervisor ,Missouri,1/13/21,2021,1,13
The Truth,Managers preach family and inclusivity but in reality they mistreat their higher performing associates and praise those who just show up and do the bare minimum. Some managers are made to work Lon hours while others get away with working a normal shift. There is no consistency in treatment or expectations. Often there’s a double standard for favorites and it’s not hidden well. ,4,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Gainesville, FL",1/13/21,2021,1,13
Depressing and stressful working environment ,"Walmart is a shady company in general. When I worked there they refused to accommodate to doctors notes and still refuses to this day to pay me my PTO when I had resigned.

Very mutual workplace.,"The interview was simple. I was not asked many questions but I was asked about my experience and what I like to do. They tell you your position and then put you on a computer for virtual training. I worked as a CAP 2 Associate. My tasks were to unload the truck (occasionally), then go to a assigned area. Paper, Chemicals, or a aisle number. I then would work the freight that I first received from the grocery side which would be 2 - 4 pallets (depending on what aisle your working on, then work the pallet(s) from the GM side that the truck unloaders stacked. After every box that you open you need to put in to the side safely and neatly and throw all boxes in the bale making machine before you leave to lunch or to clock out, all plastic must go into a plastic bag then placed in a specific area. You will be rushed to finish as much work as possible so that they can send you to help the next associate so everyone can finish. They want you to finish your isle in a specific amount of time, and if you don’t you will start to be held accountable after the 2nd week.

Better than what I expected,"In the beginning, I was apprehensive about working at Walmart after reading the reviews, but working there was a lot better than what I expected. There were definitely some young and immature team leads and management needs to do a better job of not recruiting these types of people. However, there were also some great managers and team leads as well. My goal was to just steer clear of the immature ones as much as possible. Overall, this was a production environment and this made the job not fun anymore for me. This employer wants you to meet production goals, but do not always provide everything needed to be consistently successful in this role. Either lessen the production goals or make sure that your workers have every single thing that they need to be successful. Also, production should be based on orders completed not items completed. Many times we had too walk around for supplies or constantly ask for certain supplies. Machines would break down and had to be fixed on a regular basis. Also, there were a lack of orders and sometimes, work would be slow or non-existent. Also, the radio played hard-core rap at times and inappropriate commercials and rap songs at times with profanity and this was not conducive to a good work environment. Need to also address employees who were extremely loud  and raucous and used profanity as well. Other than that work environment was good in terms of lighting, space, cleanliness (when it was cleaned), except need soap in bathrooms when soap dispensers broke often.

Dead end job with no chance at full time. ,I worked here for about a year as a 3rd shift part time stocker. The pay was lousy and management was out of touch with their employees.

Time wore on and the company changed with the times. Now the schedules are not great, requiring at least 1 weekend day. The pay is still phenomenal. But that wasn’t enough to keep long tenured techs.

I loved the flexibility and control I had over my schedule, I knew exactly what my paycheck would be and how to access all of my paperwork. But the management (along with constantly changing. I personally had 6 different managers in my roughly 2 years) will constantly try to get you to do more then what you're paid for and all in all was the reason I left.

Policies were not explained properly and they do not take to kindly to Covid leave, and will point you for having to take care of your child that has been sent home from school who was directly exposed to Covid. If your a hard worker you never get any praise only discourage daily. They never hired enough help so that meant us ladies working twice as hard to the point of passing out. They don't know how to delegate people according to what their strong at...they expect people to work like robots. And constantly rushing staff to the point of injury. They take from your PTO when it's a holiday, even if your already scheduled off that day. The store conditions are falling apart and refuse to fix them. I’m not saying this about all stores but the one I was with didn’t care about your well being, only about what was good for them.

Co-workers help save the day at times ,"I’m glad to see Walmart, as a whole, caring about its employees throughout this pandemic.

Fun workplace with a lot of rules ,"Working there is ok until you have something personal to take care of or an emergency comes up and you have to leave the workplace mid day.

It’s not horrible if the managers like you. ,"Working Cap 2 is relatively straightforward as long as you can finish your tasks on time. Management in general is not very good though, a lot of the times you have to be on the good side of all the managers if you want to move up anywhere or else you will be stuck in the same position. But as long as you come in and do your job, you should be fine. ",3,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Fort Worth, TX",1/8/21,2021,1,8
Pick your poison ,"As a manager, there is not much of a life or much sleep. The expectations are very high and some stores, not all, are very iffy. Met great people and learn lots of things that you can take with you anywhere. Working in retail, there are expectations of getting it done, and then there is Walmart. My store lacked support from higher ups and too many chiefs and our leader was not strong. Too many middlemen making decisions causing a great deal of disorganization through the whole store. Working hourly is not enough pay for this billion dollar company, and salaried members get abused. Again, This is not ALL Walmart’s,  but this experience alone has caused me to view this company in a different light and not a good one. ",2,Current Employee,Coach ,"Baltimore, MD",1/8/21,2021,1,8

Good company. Its all in the people.,It sll depends on your area and what you put in. Corp. can miss what a store needs wjen doing what the company needs. Employees pay the price. For many years I felt like I was being overlooked or looked down on. Then I realized that everyone felt that way except those that went beyond in there work. When I became one of those people I learned that I was expected to do more be more. Sometimes rewarded for stepping up. Other times it felt like I was punished due to others that were unable to complete their responsibilities.,4,Current Employee,Walmart associate. ,"Owasso, OK",1/7/21,2021,1,7

One of the lucky ones...,"I took a job at Walmart to enjoy a slower pace after dropping out of my MBA program. As much as I have heard poor things about management and corporate, I was very lucky to have open communication with every level of leadership.

The Best Job I've Ever Had,"My typical shift would depend on which departments they needed associates in. For example, if the cart pushers were lacking in people, I'd personally volunteer to help out, since I enjoyed the manual labor. This applied to daytime stocking, the customer service desk, even maintenance and door security at times. But I was primarily stationed at the front, manning specific registers or overlooking one of the two self checkout areas, both different in size. Working would include your typical cashiering experience: dealing with customers being themselves(in both positive and negative aspects), managing my area, taking care of returns, age checks for alcohol and cigarettes, etc.) Management can be described as, intriguing, for the most part; depending on who the specific manager was during the day, everything would either get done efficiently, or fall to ruin. Personally, the social aspect was my favorite part of the job. Interacting with customers, managers, and coworkers was always a momentous occasion. Life could be throwing every curve ball my way and leave me to my unhappy thoughts, yet the best of the aforementioned people would find ways to keep me sane and deliver a smile to my face when I needed it the most. To say I loved my time working there would be a vast understatement, as I truly had a passion for helping everybody during employment.",5,Former Employee,Cashier and Customer Service ,"San Antonio, TX",1/7/21,2021,1,7
Rather be homeless than to work at the Walmart I worked at,"Don't get me wrong not all Walmarts are the same. I have heard good and bad things about each Walmart. However the Walmart I worked at employees were mean and managers were lazy. Manager will go missing more than half the day, employees sit around and gossip. I worked at the 1640 location in state college. The only good part about this job is the pay and having paid time off. Other than that you are just overworked to death.

False Leadership and underpaid,"The management only worry about their benefits, so if that means not hiring enough help in order to make sure they can get the maximum bonuses possible...they wouldn't hire anyone. Which means that if your understaffed, you will be doing 3x to 4x the work.  They don't know how to delegate people according to what their strong at...they expect people to work like robots.  And constantly rushing staff to the point of injury.  They take from your PTO when it's a holiday, even if your already scheduled off that day.

Productive and a good place to get to meet new people. Management throughout the store isn't the best at urgent times. ,"A typical workday for me, if I'm opening, is to come in, dispense or pick depending on staff, and go home. On a closing evening for me, I usually pick orders until they are completely finished and clean. In urgent times, If we are behind in picks, management from other areas of the store will not help until the department is about to close. On the other hand, I have met people that I really enjoy working with and I can say they make my days go by quicker. ",3,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Colonial Heights, VA",1/7/21,2021,1,7

"Nice Workplace with Great Work Benefits, Bad Management and Bad Work Culture","A typical 8 hour shift would consist of 2,15 minute breaks every 2 hours, and an hour lunch halfway through. Management would not always give these breaks however and would often forget to send someone to replace you at your station. Cashier work consisted of several different jobs and as a male I was constantly being asked to push carts when they didn't schedule correctly and had no one gathering carts even though that is a completely different job. When I started I had about 30 minutes of training before they pretty much just left and had the sink-or-swim mentality. It can be very difficult to get time off and I believe the managers are just given too much to do or can not properly do their jobs because many communication errors and things of that sort would commonly happen. This job is not very hard even for someone that did not work in retail previously like me. Most cashiers would find ways to disappear or slack-off at work resulting in more work for others or managers getting upset at the wrong people.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Saint Charles, IL",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Fun and good atmosphere,"Great the work atmosphere is amazing and the people are easy to get along with. Very good work, the stocking is very simplw and so is the zoning. Awesome workplace",5,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Graham, TX",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Good people bad managers,"The people you work with are great for the most part, but how management runs and chooses favorites is a big downside to the company. Its a huge corporation and ran like one.",3,Current Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Vancouver, WA",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Good place to work. Hard to get on as a full-time employee.,"I loved working at Walmart because of my coworkers, the job itself was fun to me, and I had good hours there at times. I worked there for two years and was promised to be moved to full-time and never was. They would work me 40 hours a week (full-time) for a month and then drastically cut my hours, so they didn't have to give me full-time. The pay was okay, better than most retail stores. They expect a lot out of you, and if you show you have initiative, they ask for more and more. It became very stressful. ",4,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Lucedale, MS",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Steady work,A good place to be guaranteed a paycheck. Kept going to personell to get my insurance but the personell manager said I didn't get benefits for a year. This kept on until I missed my deadline which must be applied for on the first day of the month your 90 days will occur.  They had supposedly sent something in snail mail about it instead of notifying via company emails or just making it clear. So worked 7 months without benefits.,3,Current Employee,Customer Host ,"Murfreesboro, TN",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Not worth it!,"Way too much expected of the small staff that shows up. And the ones who do show up are very underappreciated, while the ones who call out all the time and act very disrespectful are the ""favorites"".People constantly getting pulled from their departments to help other departments, but then get in trouble for not having their work done.Management is ok. Some were great. Others were on a major power trip.Dealing with extremely rude customers on a daily basis makes you feel worthless by the end of your shift.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"West Burlington, IA",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Welcoming and productive work environment,"The typical day of work was very enjoyable and informative. At the start of every shift we would be informed on any new events within the store. Working here I have learned how to operate a pallet jack, and more efficient methods for my work.  The most enjoyable part of working for this company is I was kept busy at all times. There was always something to do even if I was finished in my department. ",4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Carrollton, GA",1/6/21,2021,1,6

It’s okay. ,"It’s not a job I recommend to anyone unless they really need a stable job. If you do work here, respect yourself enough to not fall into the trap that most of your older managers did. Sometimes a raise shouldn’t be enough to make you stay there. They talk to you like a child still in middle school. You aren’t treated like an individual who has their own life. I recommend seeing this job as nothing but temporary until a better opportunity comes. ",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Fort Smith, AR",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Don't work here,Terrible place to work. The management is always breathing down your neck. You're constantly understaffed and there's always some type of bug in the system keeping the work from going smoothly. ,1,Current Employee,OGP Associate ,"Prairieville, LA",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Management,"management is my biggest issue with walmart. the managers don’t really include themselves in the job so much, unless they’re in our department looking for people who aren’t doing their job as well as others. they don’t really contribute much other than that, the workplace lacks encouragement as well. ",1,Current Employee,OGP Associate ,"Danville, VA",1/6/21,2021,1,6
They treat us like prisoners. ,They rather promote people that only been there for 4 months compared to someone who has been there for more then a year and knows everything that they are doing. We can't joke or have fun without getting yelled at. No matter how hard we are working it never is good enough.  They rather schedule less people even though we are super busy because it saves them more money to pay out. We are always doing more then what are job title ask and never getting help when we need it. ,1,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Port Charlotte, FL",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Mega Corp you will be treated as a number!,"Typical mega corporation. Not bad but serious under staffed. Numbers us the game. Youre a number and can easily be removed or rewritten.

Eliminating long tem associates to save money. ,"Horrible unrealistic goals .

Catastrophic coverage at best.Very unhelpful central scheduler for my spouse and peers in the pharmacy. We all know who that is.Lying, cheating, and backstabbing associates succeed very well; troublemakers never held accountable.Refused to let associates wear a mask when Covid first hit.Stay clear of Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Manager ,Various,1/6/21,2021,1,6

The People Made it work,"So I’ve been fortunate to be able to work at 3 different Walmart locations. I started in Colorado, the people there were amazingly kind. Customers were awesome, management helpful, it was an overall great experience. I then transferred to Elmira, NY and was quickly able to become management (CSM). The co-workers were toxic, mean, and overworked; the management was nice but, unhelpful. I then transferred to Philadelphia Walmart. The worst possible experience! Management was lax, unhelpful, and co-workers were overworked & upset all the time. Schedules would frequently be missing and mistakes regarding hours were commonly made. There were not enough employees to handle the volume of customers & complete daily necessities like stocking, and cleaning work area. ",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Philadelphia, PA",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Fun work place,Safe work place and most benefits. Flexible schedule for associates; bonus every quarter month. Lunch 1 hour for 8h and 2 breaks of 15mn each etc it’s depends when you less than 8h etc,1,Current Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Irving, TX",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Fun working environment and the people are always helping each other. ,"No matter how hard the job gets, everybody always seems to get the job done one way or the other.

",4,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Sales Associate ,"Madill, OK",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Terrible place to work. Steer clear of this company ,"Worst company I’ve ever worked for. Very unorganized, management doesn’t care, the pay is too low for the amount of things you have to deal with on a day to day basis. The customers run this business because management is too scared to do anything. They don’t care if you get sick. During this pandemic they barely clean, they let customers walk around with no mask. Customers are always fighting. It’s just too much drama and not worth the headache. Barely run for growth. Even the supervisors got paid so little! So glad to be free of this company.",1,Former Employee,Self Checkout Host/Cashier ,"Waterbury, CT",1/6/21,2021,1,6
Hours suck. Management doesn't give care about employees ,Hours suck Management doesn't care about employees. If you want a day off forget about it. Requests off are completely ignored  and then denied or rejected after the date. Managers are rude and dont train you properly ,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Johnstown, PA",1/5/21,2021,1,5
Job security ,Overall it is a fun place to work at. You always have a task to do and it will definitely keep you busy. Job security is a plus if you make it to management. The pay is decent and benefits are great. ,5,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Meridian, ID",1/5/21,2021,1,5
Best company to drive for ,"Hands down the best experience of my life working with every individual up at the red bluff terminal as a driver.

That’s work and consistency pay off with this company.  You can do whatever you put your mind to.,5,Current Employee,Academy Coach ,"Dallas, TX",1/5/21,2021,1,5
Terrible culture and management,"The biggest drawback to this job was having to work with the department manager. They had the title of a manager, but absolutely no idea how to lead and encourage a team. They regularly put me and my coworkers down for the simplest things, even those with disabilities. The saving grace of this job were a few coworkers who were genuinely helpful and pleasant to be around. Everyone else at this location just seemed miserable to be there. They focused on doing the bare minimum which often lead to me having to pick up the slack for others.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Norristown, PA",1/5/21,2021,1,5

Walmart is an amazing work place that takes finishing any and all tasks seriously ,"Walmart is an amazing company that goes the extra mile for their workers but more importantly their customers; but if I have to choose in which way Walmart can improve their company it would be the management. The management at Walmart can be a little difficult to deal with because of the simple fact of Walmart lacking managers, but besides the management problem Walmart is an excellent company.",4,Former Employee,Cart Associate ,"Jacksonville, FL",1/5/21,2021,1,5

Pay,Under no circumstances do not work at Walmart Distribution Center in New Braunfels. Waste of time. Hiring process was a breeze but management is poor. ,1,Former Employee,Frieght Handler ,"New Braunfels, TX",1/5/21,2021,1,5
Okay job for students.,"Fairly good pay (11.00-11.50) entry level. I was hired as a Selfcheckout (SCO) Host, though mostly I find myself and other of my SCO Co-worker pushing carts from the parking lot. There is very minimal hands on job training, your kinda just told to figure it out as you go. If you mess up because you have zero training, management will be very critical of you for the rest of your tenure there. Endless hours of standing in one spot, doing absolutely nothing as a SCO Host. In conclusion, It is a very easy and simple position. Easy to catch on when you have helpful co-workers, and decent management. FYI: I once got in trouble for speaking to my co-workers while working SCO, even though our only job duty is to stand there for hours per shift. (Shocking? Ikr.) Your experience at Walmart will be dependent on the type of management you have. Of course it’s retail so you will have to deal with impatient and unfriendly customers.",3,Current Employee,Self Checkout Host ,"Dallas, TX",1/5/21,2021,1,5

Stockman,When I would clock in we would have a meeting in the stock room to detail what areas I would be working for that day. I would bring out stock as well as straighten up counters. Between first break and lunch we would have another meeting to see where everybody was at as far as stocking their areas. At times they would call us back to unload trucks as they came in and take the merchandise to the floor or put it in a holding area. Before going to breaks and lunch we would clean up our areas take our cardboard and trash back to the compactor‘s. There would be times that we might have to clean up spills. We would put extra stock on the top shelf that way when we could restock at a moments notice. You had an allotted time to get your merchandise on the shelves quickly and efficiently. ,5,Former Employee,Stocker/Receiver ,"Lake Saint Louis, MO",1/5/21,2021,1,5

Competitive Pay and Excellent Benefits,Walmart has decent pay and a really good benefit package. An associate's experience at Walmart has a lot to do with the individuals attitude and effort. Like most companies you will find exceptional managers and supervisors and also some very poor ones. The store in which I worked was good at setting expectations and training for associates. Unfortunately an associate's experience may differ greatly from store to store or worksite to worksite. This variance is attributable to management from the top down. Advancement opportunities where I worked were exceptional. Associates were getting promoted all the time.   ,3,Former Employee,Fresh Department Manager ,"Oak Park Heights, MN",1/5/21,2021,1,5

Worst place ever,They don’t like their employees.  Treat them like they’re not human.  They repeatedly cut hours without no explanation and won’t give you any when you ask for some.  So basically you’ll just have to find unfilled shift on the app.  Which is quite frustrating. ,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Pine Bluff, AR",1/5/21,2021,1,5

Unfair management practices and not considering age of associates.,Some assistant managers need to be fired or need training in employee relations. They try to work a minimum of associates as if there was a full overnight staff to perform all of the necessary duties. If that is to be done then overtime should be offered and paid.,1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker/Sales Associate ,"Colonial Heights, VA",1/4/21,2021,1,4
Decent job if you get lucky with management,Management is ridiculous.

Soul sucking,"There are opportunities for advancement and the pay can be decent once you work your way up but most people that genuinely care about doing their jobs well are very unhappy. Management can be good or bad but corporate makes changes that are usually bad for the employees. If you're a valued employee, you are taken advantage of and overworked. The company does not care about you. Constant restructuring causes job insecurity and frustration. If you aren't available 24/7 you don't get hours. If you are available 24/7 you don't get sleep.

Horrible work-life balance and unrealistic goals set by management,"You'll receive no real training unless the person they have you shadow actually wants to train you. Otherwise they will usually stick new associates on the floor and just tell them to take product and put it on the shelf. No explanation of how to read shelf labels, how much you should expect to be stocking a night, etc.. Most don't make it past a month or two, some not even a week, those that do work hard and are efficient at their role end up being taken advantage of, causing them to quit within 1-3 years.Nobody outside of WM takes time worked for WM seriously, regardless of how great you were or your position. Thus, WM becomes a revolving door where good workers end up going back after leaving because of job security where at least the hours are guaranteed 40+.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Puyallup, WA",1/4/21,2021,1,4
The people.,With out family's love there isn't a family that is there to provide for it is only a giant organized mess. I really enjoyed working here. It was my ideal favorite job. I was in a huge building wear all my problems that i had was no longer with me. I was a little kid again. I always felt this way when i walked into walmart. There were times were id feel like i was flying literallt cloocked in and then out. Felt like i didnt even break a sweat. It was this fun. I enjoyed alot. The.

Productive and friendly environment.,While I was working at Walmart I very much enjoyed the experience. The management was very understanding when something happened in life.

"Constant Work, Good Pay","I was hired for the weekend schedule but after being hired, I was informed that our shift would go to 6 day per week for the holidays.

The pay was good; seasonal I was at over 21 an hour; after the holidays I would have gone down to about 18 an hour which would have still been nice. You may get sent home due to low orders.

It's an ok job if you don't plan on staying long,"At the begining it was an ok job, but after being there a year things kind of went down hill especially with covid. Depending on the manager you work for and the dept you're in will also affect you enjoying your job and make you wanna just go home.

Good pay in most places . Anything else is less convenient ,"I had been with Walmart for 6 years.  It was my first job as a teenager. Lasted more than anyone else I got hired with. At first it was a great job. After years it started getting worse. Managers became worse. Favorited associates over others. Store manager has big duties but never cared about associates opinions and/or concerns. Lots of people got away with things like tardiness, absences, not doing their own job. Managers claiming they were able to give hours yet send people home. They didn't care about the work or extra work you put in. They didn't appreciate the things you did or anything extra you did for the company. Managers expect associates to do everything while they walk around and get paid doing nothing. Managers not giving breaks or lunches on time sometimes. Slow response times from managers when customers complain. Not getting any bonuses like we were suppose to.  Lack in hours when you need it the most but don't expand.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Odessa, TX",1/3/21,2021,1,3

"Good environment, not travel friendly ","I’ve always told people Wal-Mart is a great place to work and really takes care of its employees. I worked in e-commerce for 2 years in California and absolutely loved it (other than an incident with one specific supervisor). The medical benefits are pretty good for single people and the vision and dental are average. Walmart is overall pretty good, and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a stable minimum wage job. HOWEVER I cannot recommend it for anyone who has ANY plans whatsoever to move in the future. I recently moved from CA to NJ. Issues with my supervisor accepting my transfer aside, my pay increase of 2% per year, gained from my excellent yearly reviews, did not transfer with me. So I started at my new store with 2 years of experience, working a non-management job and starting at minimum wage. I fought with customer relations for a little over a month before it was confirmed that, in no way shape or form was my bonus going to transfer over - and that’s how it’s supposed to go. I really loved working there, and thoroughly enjoyed my job, but I’m not the kind to stay in one place for long. If you think you’re going to be leaving for ANY reason - family, another job, ANYTHING - do not work here. Your hard work will not show at your new store.

Management and expectations are awful.,No matter which position you are in management will always be a thorn in the side expecting more than can be done due to being understaffed. As well as the hours are very irregular and don't allow for much outside of work.,1,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"St. Louis, MO",1/3/21,2021,1,3
Wide variety of positions. Many locations available so transferring is a nice benefit should one require it.,"It's not the worst job.

This is not a customer focused environment.  ,"I worked full-time as a seasonal employee in the electronics department.  Even in this specialty department, customer service was not only below-par, but was in fact discouraged.  While I understand the balance needed between re-stocking and engaging customers, to actually hear a Lead chastise a co-worker for engaging a customer, ""when there is work to be done"" on the sales floor for all to hear blew my mind.  Employees are encouraged to point customers in the right direction (""over in aisle 3"") and move on! The Holidays are over -- and so is my job here.  My experience fits with the knowledge that Walmart aims to be all self-service check-out . . . eliminating a big chunk of their payroll.

Most incompetent managers I have ever seen. ,"If you apply here, don't apply for overnights. They have unrealistic expectations when putting away freight. They constantly put you down for not working faster when they don't even allow you the training you deserve. I've been here over a month and haven't received ANY training. I was just thrown into a department and told to get to work. ",1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Vincennes, IN",1/3/21,2021,1,3
An honest statement.,"Dysfunctional.  But most companies are.  management isn't fair.  Walmart isn't fair.  Take it on the chin, let things go, and keep the paycheck because it is better than a food chain's paycheck.  You can endure it.  It's better than a food chains work site.   And whatever you do, come to work on time and leave on time.   They are currently doing tricks with income (the last 2 years).  They'll quote you a price and you just take it bec it would be your starting wage.      Tricks are...changes in 9 days off a year to 5 days off a year (and if you are at 5 days they fire you but rehire you after 30 days so you get less $), lower $ until you do Pathways, your bonus is less bec of poor store management and bec you are only a very-part-time part-timer), you switch to another department and you might get less..",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Fairmont, WV",1/3/21,2021,1,3
Compensation doesn't match the amount of work.,Sick days are considered just like you not showing up for work. Management works you like a dog. Good managers have left because of the way they treat employees. On the upside I stayed in shape. Most management is money driven. You can't do everything and expect nothing to suffer. This is just my personal perspective. ,3,Former Employee,"Meat Department, Deli, Produce, General Merchandise and Cashier ","Norman, OK",1/3/21,2021,1,3
Family atmosphere but high turnover,"I began working at Walmart out of need to find a job, any job. I soon realized that I really enjoyed a good percentage of my coworkers. Many of them were lifers at Walmart and it was a very tight knit community. I never planned on being there that long and was reluctant to get attached, but I did. I soon learned that many of the higher up managers were not terribly concerned about bullying behaviors by other staff. When I transitioned from working in the deli, which no one wanted to work anyway, to being a cashier, I enjoyed seeing the same customers over and over again. There was a good schedule, two hours, break, two hours, lunch, two hours break, two hours, home. Some days shorter, some days longer. I've seen other coworkers completely burned out, crying in the bathroom, some people getting sick while working and encouraged to stay on the floor and not go home. There is a very strict 'point' system for missing days, outside of the whole pandemic. I did find that some of the lower level managers were very helpful in assisting their workers in going home if they were ill. By the end of my time there the place, though, felt like the Titanic, going downhill. Many have left, buckling under the pressure, and others are hanging on. I brought up my concerns for many things and they were never addressed.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier/Customer Service ,"Indianola, IA",1/3/21,2021,1,3
Pay well and you are kept busy,"     Walmart pays well but there is almost a “high school mentality” among workers including management, supervisors and Human Resources. I’ve seen instances of bullying and overall bad treatment of those who are not members of the clique of people who hang out together. The most disturbing instance is how supervisors/management will talk badly  about other workers within hearing range of the worker and others. Personally; I really liked the job, but the atmosphere is poisonous.",2,Current Employee,Stocking Associate ,"Plaistow, NH",1/3/21,2021,1,3
"Easy, Productive, and Fun Workplace","I've worked for Walmart twice and both work experiences have been the same pretty much--I enjoy what I do!! The majority of the customers and some of my coworkers are amazing and keep me encouraged in giving my job my best. You do, of course, have some nasty and mean spirited customers and coworkers as well.Management needs improvement in multiple crucial areas very much, but there are some managers that are very professional, helpful, respectful, and kind. I appreciate the 15 minute breaks as well as the 30-60 minute lunches. The pay is very reasonable and has improved over the years which I appreciate so much. I also appreciate the flexibility with scheduling and availability. The company needs extensive training in scheduling their associates appropriately, and having enough cashiers for their registers.

Terrible management ,"The management at my store was infuriating, you had a whole clique that did barely anything but judge everybody else’s work.

Unacceptable Work Environment,"The Management is horrific. You're just a number to them. No empathy. They'll fire you for no reason at all.

Potentially great but often mediocre or bad.,"I have worked at 2 stores during my tenure with Walmart, and have visited 4 others for training or various projects. All stores are different, and it all comes down to the management team. In theory, the benefits and protection that workers get from the company itself would make the company a great place to work at. However, some of the management teams you can get stuck with do more than just make the experience bad (as is often the case; no one loves to be pushed around). Sometimes, it feels as if the management teams go out of their way to make you feel less than a cog in the machine. You could work the hardest you’ve ever worked in your life, and with some stores, your efforts will be recognized and you will climb up the ladder. In other stores, you could do the same thing, but the management teams will pick on one of your weak areas and cite that as a reason you are a bad employee. If you are considering a job, however, I wouldn’t be dissuaded. There are moments you can create and experiences you can have at Walmart that you won’t find anywhere else, and the benefits are unexpectedly great.

Okay to have as your first job,"This was my first job and I think it taught me a lot of what I basically need to know when it comes to working in a retail environment. Mind you, I was working at a Neighborhood Market, so it was not as chaotic as a Supercenter. However, since it was the only 24 hour Walmart in the area it did get very hectic at times for the front-end! I picked up all the training very quickly and easily, my co-workers all got along for the most part, and management, I think, could have done a little better with fixing their favoritism with some of the employees. Nonetheless, management was pretty okay. They would sometimes watch you like a hawk on some days, but it was most likely just part of their job. The hardest part I would say is the rude customers that would come in, especially around the holidays or other seasons, such as the Back-to-School season. My favorite part was whenever I would see regulars that would go specifically to my register to chat with me while I scanned their items.

An ok job,I worked at Walmart just pay my bills. Some days managers would have you do everything including their job. Sometimes I had to hide in the bathroom just to take a break. ,3,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Kissimmee, FL 34746",1/2/21,2021,1,2
Never settle for Walmart,"If you are considering working here I would only advise doing so for work experience.

"Job is straight forward, can be temporary but their is room for advancement","I enjoyed the job, the only thing that isn't nice is your break is dependent on someone taking over your register.

A good place to start,So I would have to say working for Walmart is not bad if it’s your first job.

Get your experience and move on.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Bristol, TN",1/1/21,2021,1,1
The associates ,Difficult place to work. Management keeps pushing for more. We have less employees and they still expect the same amount of work. Recognition most of the time goes to the wrong place. No sense of job security. Seems to be favoritism. ,2,Current Employee,Assistant store manager ,"Asheville, NC",1/1/21,2021,1,1
Not a good place ,I worked at Walmart for a while now and they completely ignored me and the hours were horrible they had so many problems plus they never give breaks and lunches usually there an hour or two behind.  They Are so under staffed.  I got fired because I had an family emergency and that wasn’t a good enough reason they told me. Even tho I had a funeral to attend to n the worst part is it was my nieces funeral. That’s all I have to say about them,1,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Greenville, TX",1/1/21,2021,1,1
Good pay but benefits suck ,"Working here is ok but they expect too much out of one person in just one day and get upset if you don’t finish something. It takes multiple times of bothering management for them to finally do something you asked them to do that they said they would do. The point system is absolutely ridiculous, you could be really sick and have no PPTO and they would give you a point because they don’t take doctor notes. The only thing good is the pay and hour lunch (unpaid) and two paid 15 minute breaks. ",3,Current Employee,Food Associate ,"Ashland, OH",1/1/21,2021,1,1

Depended on the day,Often times the work wasn’t bad but it was too inconsistent with management and staffing support. Some managers were fantastic and some were horrific. Every time reviews were being done it always seemed to be that I personally wasn’t getting a review but the department/collective of people I worked with were. Pretty hard to care when someone says you aren’t personally doing something then you give exact examples of how you were and the only response was well “not everyone else is when they should be.” I didn’t know performance reviews were done as a collective. ,3,Former Employee,Hardware Associate ,"Troy, MO",1/1/21,2021,1,1

They do not deep clean for covid like they say they do. They do not count the customers in the store for covid most of the time like they are supposed to. They make manager and employees “swarm” freight in groups, not socially distancing. They have never addressed a single issue I have went to them with concerns about.

The customers are always a treat and enjoyable experience and even some of the regular employees as well. ,"I would not recommend the Franklin facilities to anyone not even customers. This facility never answers their phones for anyone not even their employees, managers never care to meet with their employees or especially the customers. I have had so many complain about how whenever they call the store they can never reach anyone or if by chance they do their always told that their too busy even when the customers make the trip to the store and matter when. When customers are notified to come in and pick up their orders that should of been suposedly ready, they get turned away and are told that there is no that can help you even after following the store computers instructions for pickups and even after having waited an hour. This store should really be closed down for so many violations against its own policies it crazy I mean they even allow retalliation despite their own policy stating that there is and will be a zero tolerance for this.

Mental health,"If you are diagnosed with any form of mental health; I wouldn't even bother with the Walmart franchise. The company is an Anti-Union type. Meaning they don't allow others to represent/support employees cases. The company will not accept any form of mental health as a medical problem until you have been with them at least 12 months. If you were to be transparent during your hiring phase and let them know that you do suffer from mental health; they may still hire you. However, its a losing battle in the long run.

Please do not work here.,Just don’t work here I’m not joking I wouldn’t wish this on my worse enemy for the reason that the lack of respect communication and understanding is absent in every department. The cap members especially cap 2 are nicer and more professional and respectful than management there. They are willing to fire anyone that they do not like or even makes a small mistake but then will say at tomorrow’s shift start meeting that they are always understaffed. Seriously do not work here take a job somewhere else with someone who will respect you as a person and not as someone who is expendable and has no limitations and doesn’t care about safety.

"Busy workplace; while this can be fun, it can also be annoying when you do not receive your breaks or lunches on time.","Setting up your work schedule at Walmart allows for flexible hours that you choose. These exact hours are never guaranteed each week, but they are not allowed to schedule you outside these hours unless it is for holiday exceptions. A typical shift of four hours gives you one break. Five hours gives you two breaks. Six hours gives you two breaks and a thirty minute lunch. Anything over that gives you two breaks and an hour lunch. The lunch periods are unpaid, so in order to work a full eight hours, you have to be schedule for nine hours with a one hour lunch break.

I was off and the other associate that was willing to help was put on top stock. It was a very petty place to work. Once management asked me if I would be willing to work in another department and I told them no because I knew it was a set up and two days after I told them no my vacation request that I had in the system for months was denied. I know that was not a coincidence. Management clicked up with each other and never truly helped unless there was a big event happening (I.e. regional visit, inventory, echo lab visit, etc.). Instead of management helping you they do everything in their power to make you fail. Store stayed understaffed!!!! Definitely was not payed enough for the job I did.

Walmart DC 6040,As a manager you have a great deal of responsibility and taking care of your associates it is important as they can make you or break you.  Sometimes is challenging as new upper management comes from other places like Good Year and don’t know the Walmart way ribbing associates wrong and damaging other folks credibility.

Self motivated not Management motivated ,This is a great job if you are about getting your work done and getting out at the end of your shift. But nowadays management is so focused in their own tasks that they neglect the little people and will push you passed your limits and expect things of you with very little coverage or help. Depending on what area you work you may receive some help from management or none at all. Your concerns with other employees are hardly ever heard or dealt with as well so it can be stressful from time to time.,4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cedar Falls, IA",12/30/20,2020,12,30

Overworking,Not only do the management give total disregard to the associate's wellbeing but also the incompetency in the corporation is so lively that despite the wording of their policy they force minors to work up to another shift past their own. I have been working for Walmart for 4 months now and I am expected to just drop everything to cover for associates who blatantly refuse to do their job.

Environment ,"Walmart is unorganized. Schedules are ridiculous. They cut your hours after calling out ONCE. The pay does not match the amount of work you put in. Managers are IMPOSSIBLE to talk to their is about two managers that are understanding and are willing to help you. They hire so much people only to fire them. They say “there are too much workers & not enough hours” but they hire people every week & yet Walmart is still understaffed. The cash registers up front are supposed to all open but they are so understaffed that’s why the lines are always long. They use you until they find someone new & then fire you & repeat.

Stressful," Overworked and micromanaged. Some store managers are better than others with communication. Varies on store. Too much expected of you outside of your job, salary means overworked. If your manager is in jeopardy of losing his job, he berates you, ignores your solutions and ignores your calls/texts. The people I managed were the best part. Other managers are better at accepting you solutions than others. It really depends on the attitude of the store manager.",2,Current Employee,Assistant manager ,"Asheville, NC",12/29/20,2020,12,29
Don’t apply,"The management and managing style is comparable to politics. A whole mess of brown nosing is required just to be considered for a promotion.

Poorly managed from the top down,"Although each store is different, an overwhelming theme with Wal-Mart is the complete and utter failure of management to run the stores smoothly. With some stores, it is because they refuse to hire more staff for desperately understaffed departments. For others, it is because they constantly pull employees from their primary departments to cover for the call-offs in other departments (made even worse by the lack of properly staffed departments in the first place.)While there are individual managers who excel at treating the employees under them with respect, the corporation as a whole will treat you as disposable. They can and will find someone to replace you if you object too strongly, or ask for a raise too many times, or act as anything other than the retail robot they expect you to be.",2,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Salem, OH",12/29/20,2020,12,29

Keep raising production ,"Every week it seems like production is raising and they’re aiming more towards laying off more people. They don’t really offer a lot when it comes to flexible hours because depending on the shift you choose your stuck with thought until you hit one year in the company and can change, same goes for job title. Pay is nice for a warehouse job vs Amazon but working conditions could be better especially during the summer. Management pushes everyone to do more than what they are supposed to/capable of and it does get ridiculous really quickly. Overall though a decent place if you need a job that works for you. Doesn’t challenge you mentally, not much room for growth even though they stress internal hires (which seems like bs), you get lip from HR over using ppto and generalizing every time you use it your “abusing” it.

It's a really easy job,I agree with all of the rules and procedures at Walmart. I think that an hour lunch is definitely rewarding to it's employees.

Nightmare of a workplace ,"I worked at Walmart for over a month and was disappointed at the way management treated cashiers. Most managers at the Lompoc Walmart were rude and disrespectful at times for no reason . The upfront mangers lack to teach you register skills and command codes before leaving you alone at a register. You basically have to fend for yourself and learn alone as you go. Walmart lacks proper training on the registers which is vital in order to checkout customers. Management here soured the job for me as they were out of line at times and were hesitant to help you when needed. Not to mention that they would get mad at you for not knowing how to do your job correctly. They would leave you alone at self checkouts with a TC device where you could get ahold of management but they either never responded back to your help request or would respond really late . On more than one instance I witnessed the mangers get my message and completely ignore it. Another big issue here is that management gives out conflicting orders, for example you can be told to do something by a specific CSM(manager) and then be told by another CSM that what you're doing completely wrong. In the end I think that the job itself as a cashier wasn't too bad ,it was just management that ruined it for me.",1,Former Employee,Cashier & Front End Services ,"Lompoc, CA",12/28/20,2020,12,28
"Advancement, nothing much else.","You get opportunities to advance and move within stores. But honestly the worst company I ever worked for.

Pay not fair,"I've been there 2 years and haven't had a raise. The high school kids make more than I do and the point system isn't fair. Management plays favorites and the ones they like somehow make they're points go away. I've asked for a more consistent schedule but they keep saying they're working on it yet newer employees who don't have children seem to get the better schedules. On the other hand the customers are very appreciative of the service we provide. Much more so than management. Lots of criticism very little accolades. Lots of threats such as if we don't get enough surveys they'll move us to a different department.

Sure it's cold, but what do you expect in a cooler/freezer. Just put on an extra layer and a sweater. The manager I had was awesome. He was very supportive and kind. He really understood us under dogs. There should be clones of him. Unloading the trucks were hard for me. After a while you get used to it, and build muscles/lose weight. The only thing is: I ran over my foot once with a pallet jack. The floor of the truck was slippery from condensation. But, everything turned out okay. I didn't see the need to file a claim, but management really wanted me to in case something became of it. I probably would've stayed more than 7 months if that didn't happen to be honest. Not anyone's fault. I just broke my foot once before and still have PTSD from that. I worked it the daytime, so I would stock milk, eggs, yogurt, etc. Overall a great experience. Miss it sometimes.

decent place to work if you keep to yourself and don't mind hard work,"A good about this store is a small hand full of associates are kind friendly and easy to work with on morning-early afternoon shift and night shift only and is a decent place to shop from time to time depending on the time of day. A bad thing about this store is cooperation between management and associates, Disrespect for fellow associates, Job advancement is difficult unless you are shown favoritism by certain individuals, The store is under staffed most of the time, and shortage of working equipment is a problem that remains to be resolved.My most enjoyable part of my job at this company is assisting customers helping new associates that are poorly trained by management and making sure I finish my main tasks with good quality. The hardest part of my job is when trying to cooperate with fellow cap team 2 second shift associates they would be dis respectiful towards me even when trying to be respectful and cooperative. And as far as most of the management system goes it has a few flaws there is always miscommunication between them no matter what the subject is about, they are uninformative of their jobs especially when new associates need information on work and store policy that the associate computers don't provide, and most of them have no on hands training in most of the work areas and positions the supervise over and there is the time when other associates of different shifts they said they never did a drug test even they were known for smoking pot and drinking and management told me that I had to or they would freeze my application for six months which sounds discriminatory - more...",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Martinsville, VA",12/27/20,2020,12,27

Always something new happening!,So I started as a cap 2 supervisor for Walmart at first it was awful because of the management over me at this time. After that I became a sporting goods sales associate it was a fun job and good pay. About after 6 months of showing my dedication to the company I became a GM support manager so I ran a whole side of the store making sure they were doing their nightly task given to me by the assistant manager. I LOVED being a Gm support. The 4 days a week on 3 days off were perfect. I also didn’t respond directly to the assistant managers so I had a lot of own self power and ownership of my work. After about 6 months of doing that I was offered a Assistant manager position where I learned a extreme amount about being a leader not a boss. I would say overall the Walmart assistant manager job was by far the best in the company your job switched everyday. It could either be looking at processes that you were directly over and how you could improve them or execute them. Or it was dealing with a angry customer and making sure they had a truly good experience.

Wal-Mart cares more about being successful than the health of emplyees,"I was a cart pusher/stockman, All the other stock man were not very kind, and neither were the managers. For health and safety of us, we were supposed to have water out every day for us so we wouldn’t over heat. About every 2-3 weeks we would have a small cooler, and it would be gone and emptied within 2-4 hours.

The company does not care about it's associates.,"You do the manager's work with associate pay and since they don't like to hire people, they make you do everyone else's job as well.

In fact I can remember several times where I've asked a simple question over the walkie-talkie, only to get a disrespectful or sarcastic response from management. There were even managers who brushed me off when I asked them questions in person when I was still new. They acted as though I was bothering them.  The majority of my co-workers were wonderful. However there were a few bad apples who loved acting like managers, yet were (and still are) low-level employees.

When it was brought to management's attention, they again brushed me off by acting like it didn't matter to them. Getting up in the morning for work eventually became more stressful than doing the work itself. The job is extremely demanding and requires a lot of physical labor. You spend most of your day bringing out freight from the backroom, stocking shelves and setting up features in the departments.

Walmart cares about Walmart and not it’s employees ,This company use to be about encouraging their employees as well as taking care of the customer successfully. It is no longer about that.

Incompetent management and wishy washy decision making.,"Store management is incompetent and has no idea of what their job is most of the time. Store supervisor demands results out of various departments but refuses to give hours to allow for staffing to fill said demand. Workplace culture is akin to being in a high-school all over again.

Very labor intensive and had to complete 100% of the orders filled in a very limited amount of time although it was possible.  If 100% was not met consistantly they had no problem letting people go no matter the number of years a person was with the company. Learning how to stack the pallets was the most difficult part but they allowed plenty of time to learn. The pay was good and a full time position was only three(3) days a week with overtime nearly every day.

Pay is good for the DC but be ready to injure your body on the daily,"Working at the Distribution center is a decent job if you’re straight out of high school. The pay is far higher than you’re getting anywhere else but it takes a HEAVY toll on your body. I was a fit twenty-something and I had multiple life-altering injuries. After one really bad injury, they expected me to resume my job the day after. It’s a very dead end job where your pay can only go up by a few dollars, no matter how long you’ve been there. I was working with 50 year olds who had been there almost 20 years and I was making the same amount.

Unhelpful team of associates and management,"The training process is quite inefficient. You sit at a computer for around five or six hours and are expected to know everything within the first day on the floor. I was in an office waiting for about an hour and half trying to get someone to assist me and help me figure out exactly where I needed to report to. The job itself seemed easy but no one in the management team or associate team really was willing to help me. It was honestly terrible. I felt like the staff really just did not care about any of the new employees. On one of my training days, a group of employees were actively bad mouthing all the new employees. ""My day has been so terrible because of all the incompetent newbies"" is what these people were saying as I was directly behind them in the break room. I have worked around four other jobs and have never once felt so unwelcome in a work environment. We all need to start somewhere.

Learn clone jutsu or be constantly asked by the first manager why you didn't get done what the second manager interrupted. There is no structure. The defining mood is desperation.

No matter how much effort and work you put in you won’t be able to advance.

Even when there are regular associates that work under said department that know everything forwards and back don’t even get the chance to even interview for an advancement position.

Poor Management.,"I worked at walmart for almost 2 years. Anytime I had an issue with a manager, NOTHING was solved. I had to move departments because they wouldn't do anything about my issues with my supervisor. Lunches and breaks are never delivered on time and managers get mad when you ask about it. So much is expected out of you and there's no excuse for work not being done, even if you were the only one working. Favoritism is shown and nothing is done. Customers get ill with you because of lack of time on management's part. I've waited with customers for over 20 minutes waiting for management to show up. Overall, Walmart is an okay company.

When it came time for interviews I never received my interview and was always given the runaround as to why I never received an interview or anything like that. On several occasions I had to do the work of three people in more than one Department. Management was always trying to find a way to get rid of someone if they did not like them or if they was like person who kept up with the rules and procedures and they told their manager and you just start asking questions like that they would try and find a way to fire you or get you out of the door.

Not worth your time,"Save your time and don't apply to this mess. Wait times for deliveries can be up to 3 hours for Walmart employees to load your car. You're dependent on an associate who has a desire to work and a good work ethic. That's not common in some Walmart associates. Sometimes, Walmart associates lose access to the Spark app and don't know which driver is there and who they are scheduled to deliver to. The driver gets the blame for deliveries being late, even when associates are slow to load your vehicle. Drivers get the blame when associates mess up an order, forget something, or put the wrong item in. Customers schedule when they want their purchases delivered, but often times aren't home at that time. You're not allowed to take the items back to Walmart because of covid. But you can't leave the groceries at the home all alone. Beware of deliveries after sunset, customers often don't leave their porch lights on and house numbers are hard to see. There are a lot of delivery companies out there. Although this company doesn't mention that they have a delivery quota that you must do, you're deleted when you take a few days off.

Team oriented work environment,Great fast paced environment to work in. I really enjoyed getting to go to work. There is always something to do in order to stay busy.

It’s good ,"Yea everything went pretty smooth for the most part. If you get new hires and they see that the og’s slack then you got a bunch of newbies that don’t do much unless the big boss is around. Other than that it’s fun if you’re into fast pace. Days can really fly here. Management is nice if you take the time to understand that what they’re doing is demanding. Customers can be a bit bossy, again the culture is not as good.

"Beware of lying, backstabbing and drama  ","The work can be fun and easy if upper management will listen to their associates. Upper management (store and market manager) will lied and backstab the team leads and academy trainers to make them look good and cause drama between the teams. You are NOT allow to have an open opinions about your job and issues. Scheduling is a joke, they will change your hours without notice and expect you to when they want you.

"Inclusive Business, but lacks morale boosting in Upper Management","Walmart is a very fast paced and adaptive company. They are always quick to stay relevant and available for customers. I have been in upper management for almost 2 years now and we are pushed everyday to boost morale in store. However, I feel that often MY morale is not where it needs to be considering that we are 120% expected to show up and over perform everyday. Salaried work life balance is terrible especially around holidays. I feel that store managers should be given a better perspective of what it does to their team when they expect them to work 6 days a week, 12+ hours a day. That’s enough to drive the most loyal employee out. ",4,Current Employee,Coach ,"Roanoke, VA",12/16/20,2020,12,16

No One Actually Knows What They're Doing,"It's a really chill environment at first but once you start actually caring about the store you realize just how badly none of management knows what they're doing. It's all a game of playing favorites so everyone in charge is best friends and not necessarily the most qualified. If you don't fit in with them, good luck you're never getting any further than you are. Lots of high school type drama, everyone's dating each other or cheating on each other, etc. Depending on your department you'll either get as many hours as you sign up for or none at all.

Bad management ,I worked at Walmart for 5 years. I advanced quickly the first couple years but management was poor. Didn’t receive the support needed when it was time to hold associates accountable. Big turnover rate. There were 3 different GMs in the 5 years I was there and only one was good and he was gone after a year and half. I learned a lot in spite of management but wanted to learn much more. Walmart is too big to ensure they put quality managers in place. Probably too big to care as well. ,2,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager/Academy Trainer ,"Tifton, GA",12/15/20,2020,12,15
"Late with giving breaks, wont give you time off even after preapproved,",I worked at 3 stores over 4 years. 2 of the stores were difficult to work at. Negative attitude among management.

"Ok as a starter and as an entry level job, but pretty old and tiring as a career ","When I got hired for a job as a sales associate back in 2015, I was really excited and nervous. Along the way, I developed confidence and the skills needed to perform my tasks and (my favorite part about the workplace) getting to know the people along the way and forging special relationships leading to friendships beyond the workplace. Fast forward to 2020. The store is NOT what it used to be, at least in my eyes. You have store management working in a way that feels mechanic, less responsive with concerns you may have, and auto engaged (with some acting outright as total authoritarians), the quality of the interior in some parts has let itself go, and it's not long until you're annoyed by the deluge of customers looking for certain products while in the midst of performing your own job.  You're even constantly pulled away to cover other areas making up for the absence of those who normally cover those spots, so you get nothing done in your area at all. The company, I would say, is a good starting point for those fresh out of high school and college and who are just looking for any old paying job (me in 2015), but in terms of the long haul career wise, they, and with any retailer, unless you're thoroughly qualified, passionate and genuinely motivated to make a career out of it, it can get very cumbersome, very difficult, and just plain aggravating to the point where you're ready to pivot somewhere else. With what I am currently experiencing, the wage, along with its benefits, is not worth it. After 5 years, I'm more than ready to move on and forward. ",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Kansas City, MO",12/15/20,2020,12,15
Fast paced OGP work,"The newer marketing approach as OGP is a great concept as it will need human work to meet the e-customer demands. No day is the same as the previous one when you have proactive and engaged managers that think beyond the mile and motivate the employees (who can still be in their 17 through 55 age range). There are many positive highlights to this job setting and team work is amazing.Yet, as it is commonly well known by the senior employees, Walmart changes rules too frequently. Most of their managers were moved up maybe for good reasons but many lack that actual skill to be a great professional manager (make available managent seminars focused on work culture). You are not to be the best pal and show favoritism, you are not there to call your team every hour to repeat the same  steps over again or read customer reviews, and hold the team for over 10 minutes, then constantly pushing them up to hurry and finish the pick walk. Every manager should be on the same page so the least important employee receives the needed support to meet the customer demands. If the manager wants to do everything by the book, then do it impartially and don't just apply the rod when it is convenient to your own benefit. Listen to your employee and treat them with respect, not as babies. ",3,Current Employee,OGP Associate ,"Somerset, KY",12/15/20,2020,12,15
Not family friendly ,"I was on the ladder, but realized with the restructure they are no longer welcoming any parents with limited babysitting to advance in hourly management or salary. Walmart prefers single adults who have no home life and willing to live at work. Promotions are not based on work ethic or conduct. Management is built on years of unhealthy scare tactics from corporate. I would lose my job if they knew I posted this. They sensor everything. I have seen management work a month straight and easily have 18 hour days. What you hear in the news is not how they run the stores at ground level. Smoke and mirrors.",1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,Oklahoma,12/15/20,2020,12,15

"Coworkers are great, but customers are crazy","There is a reason they have #peopleofwalmart. You will meet tons of crazies, tons of annoying Karen’s, and a few in between. However, if you have a level head and know how to cover your behind as an employee, it has a a great community as a whole. Before COVID, we had donuts every Sunday, a packed and energetic break room, and very, very welcoming staff. The staff are still very welcoming, but now adhere to six foot give or take a black sheep or two. Management, excluding store owner and CEO-type management, treat you like a human being and want to know what’s going on with you. Though I had to move and no longer work for Walmart, when I come back and visit I almost always have a long conversation with a former employee or two.

"Weak company culture, with little integrity","Management backing is just words. When the chips are down, management disappears.  The company demands mediocrity. I have never seen a single IT person that was allowed to do what they were best at. Careers are ruined in the first three years by keeping employees away from their interests. Your skills will be atrophied and you will not be able to leave Bentonville once that happens. The pay is great. Bonuses are fantastic.

Used to be a lot better than it is now.,"Walmart fails to provide raises that keep pace with cost of living increases, took away previously earned sick and personal time from long-term associates, and no longer provides holiday pay.

Most of my coworkers agreed on this, especially minors, who often got ""accidentally scheduled"" on school days, resulting in being short staffed.

Just a horrible company,Maybe it was just the store I was at but honestly walmart is a horrible company to work for. The managers are all rude and so are your coworkers. I got told multiple times I was going to get trained in another department and it never happened. They scheduled me out of my time frame and never fixed it. I went to 4 different managers and nothing. I ended up getting a point for clocking out early and they always sent me to lunch early so I got points for those too.

Walmart is only about making money,"Walmart tells it’s community that they are about customers service and about helping the community but in my experience they are only concerned about their bottom line. I’ve worked for them for 18 months (Texarkana AR Super Center). I gave them my very best! There was nothing I would not do for my managers. They were appreciative of my willingness to work,  quality of work and availability to work anywhere they assigned me to work especially after the Covid -19 pandemic hit. When the Department Manager of Toys got sick and had to extend his leave they asked me to fill in as temporary Department Manager. This is when I began to notice a change in the way Walmart really cares about their workers. Managers who once were helpful and encouraging were now demanding and no longer willing to guide or teach you. The company was not willing to provide managers with equipment necessary to do daily tasks. Causing managers to fight among each other for equipment. We were not provided staff in our department to help with fundamental tasks so I alone was left to do it by myself this would eventually snowball and lead to frustration and resignation. However, there was no one to replace me so I assumed the position under duress. I inquired about additional help but I was told I would never get help in this department not even for the Christmas rush. Seasonal help was hired for over night help only. This put so much stress on me I had a break down. This was my tipping point. Then the company did away with all departments managers, in all, and made most of us (80%) associates and the other (20%) - more...",1,Former Employee,Department Manager Toys ,"Texarkana, AR",12/14/20,2020,12,14

It's a rollercoaster,"I feel that for retail work, the pay is pretty good. There is one manager I don't get along with, but for the most part, management at my store is ok. They biggest issue that makes me not like working at Walmart is the customers. Most of your shift is spent picking up after customers. They open up packages to see what the item looks like, even though there is a picture and dimensions on the package, and then leave the contents of the package strewn around. They completely wreck the clothing tables that you just spent a lot of time folding. The theft rate is unbelievable. ",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Emporia, KS",12/13/20,2020,12,13

Great pay! Flexible scheduling! That’s it.,"The starting pay is awesome! As well as a raise after your probationary period (90 days). Managers are helpful with scheduling. Cons are; ridiculously hard production goals and very short breaks that u have to shorten even more just to reach the production goal. Managers change out constantly and every one of them have their own management agenda and styles which causes a lot of confusion on certain rules and regulations, as well as the overall culture.  I have had managers hand out occurrences for very minor things and have had managers never give out occurrences for practically anything unless it’s for production. Mandatory OT is pretty much every other weekend/week if ur lucky. It’s pretty easy to advance onto other positions it seems. Overall, if u don’t mind a lot of OT and the physical nature it’s a decent job. Getting hurt was always on the back of my mind bcuz when people get hurt, u often don’t seem them very long before their gone.

Advancement opportunity,"Walmart has remained consistent in work and hours throughout the pandemic. There is always room for advancement opportunities, as long as you are willing to put in the time and effort to show your desire to promote. They provide continued business learning modules and also have a great benefit available to those looking into continued education outside of the company with $1- a day from their employees they cover the rest of tuition costs for college degrees and certifications in partnership with multiple education providers. They offer paid time off and fairly good health/vision/dental benefits. It is a retail work which isn't for everyone, therefore hours of shifts do vary. They are open most holidays and if they do close on one,  they take hours from your accumulated paid time off bank to cover your pay for that day. It can be a busy and stressful environment, there is always work to be done. It can also be rewarding with the customer interaction and appreciation. Management and personal at this store has always been supportive and encouraged career development, they are always willing to communicate with their employees and aren't afraid to help when needed.

"Okay compensation & work/life is good, not much else","The pay isn’t terrible and the management does follow availability strictly so work life balance is normally good. It’s an okay job for a college student or someone looking to make a fairly liveable wage. The company itself isn’t great and they don’t really care about their employees or customers, it’s very corporate.

Hard work but good pay.,I worked at a Distribution Center as a loader. The job itself isn't hard just stack the freight in the truck and make it look presentable but what makes it hard is the amount of lanes you have to run and how fast the freight moves at you. It's very easy to get backed up and not recover for your whole shift and when shifts are 12 hours long it can feel hopeless sometimes. The pay is so high because you earn every cent of it. It's worth checking out there are good benefits and it's a decent workplace but if you do decide to try it be prepared to work.,4,Former Employee,Loader ,"Tobyhanna, PA",12/11/20,2020,12,11

The real bottom line is keep those customers coming through the door so we can profit.  No, we don't care that you the worker is hurt, sick, dejected because of hoe we treat you, just see those products.

I was threatened and insulted multiple times and have contacted corporate to deal with it. I was let go because I did not stay after my shift to work in another department even though I still had work to do in my department.

Depressing ,"At my location, my experience with Walmart was not great. It's the first time I have never had drive in a company that I work for. Expectations and goals are unrealistic and unachievable. There is a high level of unorganization that comes from management, added on by procrastination. It's not the worst place you could work at, but you could definitely be doing better. Their attendance policy is generous compared to other companies, but at times can be unfair (specifically, during a pandemic). Lots of complacency and low workplace morale. It's hard to feel like you're contributing anything because there is no constructive/helpful feedback other than negative criticisms. It's not a place that fosters growth, but instead pushes you to your limits. Poor communication. Employees are expected to work with faulty or broken equipment/tools. Finances are not delegated properly and when mistakes happen with funding (loss prevention), employees take the hit with hour cuts. I don't recommend being an hourly employee if you are looking to actually thrive and get something out of your job, at least not the location I worked in.

Could be better,"It isn’t the worst company to work for, it mostly depends on the stores management team really. I’ve worked at a couple different Walmarts and some were great and others were not at all somewhere I felt myself being successful at. The new changes really sucked and left a lot of us worried about our next move and deciding to stay or leave the company, most ended up leaving (there wouldn’t be enough positions for all of us to get one anyway). The Market teams don’t really care how a management team works together as long as the money is coming in and making them look good to Regional and Corporate, which leaves many stores structural integrity (employee wise) really weak and difficult to work with. If I left the company, I honestly don’t think I’d ever go back. It was a good idea at the time for myself, but to grow with, not so much.

Well how am i suppose to do that if i have no clue where things are located. While the benefits are ok it takes forever to be eligible for them and if you get 5 points you are automatically terminated. The points add up really quick and for dumb stuff.

They treat their employees poorly,"It was a good environment for coworkers but most of the higher management and as a company treat employees poorly. Because they cut staffing to save money they expect one overnight stocker to do what they estimate is 34 hours worth of work in eight hours. It was very much do as much as you can and leave the rest for someone else, leaving everyone behind. Then we were expected to have time to reset the store each night. Management are either bullies or they become victims to other managers. All the good ones quit. Oh and thinking of going for management? They do mass lay offs every couple years to cut costs.

I enjoyed moving from site to site to help train new staff and help start up new DC's,I was grateful for the opportunity to start my career here and grow over the 8 years. Pay was not good as a manager especially when a new manager came in that you train and they start out making more than you. That was a slap in the face for sure. I did learn alot that allowed me to love on to another company making more and using what I learned there.

Production rate is very high ,"Production rate is very high. They don’t give you enough training or time to be able to work into getting better at your job. Many people that I spoke with that have been there for a year or two have already been written up for not meeting production, had to get re-retrained, and/or took them a longer time to grasp onto their job than what the company gives you. It is not for everyone, however, it doesn’t have to be that way, which is why they go through people like nothing. Management is different for every shift. However, your coworkers can make the job more difficult than what it needs to be, depending on their integrity. ",2,Former Employee,Order Filler/Picker ,Delaware,12/9/20,2020,12,9
Sam Walton’s Walmart is long gone ,"In the beginning it was great training, communication, opportunities. Over the years everything has changed. You can see it on everyone’s face no matter store you visit, in any state. The associates/management have no customer service skills anymore. If you call a store you have a 50/50 chance they might answer the phone. If you ask for help in a department, you will get put on hold and no one wants to pick up the phone. Walmart now puts all their efforts into online orders now, because it is the only thing keeping them in business. Associates are replaced quickly if you can’t keep up with the fast paced work environment. Unless you are a order picker, you don’t matter anymore. Sad but true.

Walmart cashier review ,I highly do not recommend this job especially for college students. Management does not care how much of a work load have all they care about is you clocking in.

Cliquey and underpaid,"Good luck at this job. The management here demands respect instead of even trying to earn it.

Some departments only half the people work, the rest sit around, talk and eat their whole shift. It’s a bunch of teenagers running the department and it’s now wonder why they can’t keep anybody there. Just stock the shelves or go to a department that doesn’t require much coworker interaction.

"Very hard work, but compensated","Walmart DC - Whether you plan to work here short term or long term, you have a lot of hard work ahead of you, but you’ll be paid well for it. They pay a high wage for unskilled labor because it’s almost all very physically demanding. But if you do about a year of that you should be able to transfer to something a little easier. And if you’re there for about 5-10 years you can sneak into a much easier and/or better paying job. If you work hard and build your rep (and nowadays if you have an education too), you can probably get promoted and have an actual career with a great salary. Most of their manager positions go to entry level associates that have worked their way up. That’s what I did. It’s very strict, and there are plenty of flaws, but overall it’s a great job.

Understaffed and poor managment training. ,This company isn't worth the time or the effort.  Very unorganized and a lack of information when employees ask questions to their management team.

Terrible management,"The head manager was excellent, but those under him are severely passive aggressive with their ""teams"".

"Decent benefits, iffy management ","Your PTO and PPTO accumulate at a decent rate and increase after a certain amount of years. Benefits are decent, health insurance is expensive and practically useless except for dental. You rarely can get overtime. Managers for the most part just don't really know what they're doing and it's hit and miss to get a decent and nice manager. Like the managers I had, minus one in particular, were all great! There are a few exceptions. There were plenty of managers I loved there. All in all, I found it a decent place to work. My experience was much different than most there... I loved my job and my coworkers, I always hear negative things about Walmart but  I liked it there. The point system is a bit ridiculous though. You get 5 points towards attendance before you're fired. 1 point per absence, 1/2 point for late or leave early, but you can use your PPTO to cover that. If you reach 5 points you will most likely be fired, unless they like/need you. I reached 5 points a couple times but they kept me cuz I was great at my job. This was all at Geneseo Walmart, each Walmart could be very different. At the end of the day, I'd recommend working at Geneseo Walmart.

If they give us our task and let us accomplish it the day goes smooth for everyone, and I notice everyone are in a lot better moods than, whenever they’re hounding us.What you learned: I’ve learned to love people no matter what because within the CAP’s we build a bond that, keep us motivated and going on the daily. Without the motivation, and if it wasn’t for the love of my people this job would be even worse. Not to mention surviving as an adult off of $11.00 an hour in a constantly rising cost of living, and other responsibilities. Gas, food, car payments etc. Management: I’m not understanding why they’re hiring egotistical, self centered, and greedy individuals who only care about numbers, and themselves but could careless about the well-being of their employees. It starts from the top, and the culture that has been built in Walmart is all about making the rich richer, and keep the poor poorer. They don’t give a single care about us! Workplace Culture: Is beautiful amongst the co-workers but as far as the culture of Walmart as a whole it’s subpar at best. There is no culture all they care about are numbers, and money keeping them comfortable while, we barely squeeze by. The hardest part of the job: It’s no hard part really other than waking up at 3 o’clock in the morning because the shifts are terrible. The job within itself after you’ve learned the process isn’t hard but the managers seem to make it that way, like they’d rather see us - more...",1,Current Employee,Stock Associate ,"Plano, TX",12/7/20,2020,12,7
Walmart sucks.,"Never work for walmart. Management doesn't care at all about you, they're only in it for themselves. They will immediately kick you to the curb the moment something doesn't go right. ",1,Current Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Tahlequah, OK",12/7/20,2020,12,7
I work with a great team of people.  ,The people you work with really help make the job.  I am lucky the location i work in has a good team. I'm sure other places have their good and bad also.  Walmart as a whole also offers decent benefits to their employees as well as protected pto and regulqr pto.  In any retail pharmacy you are required to work long hours so if working in the evenings and weekends and holidays isnt for you retail pharmacy probably isn't the way to go.  Pharmacy is also a fast paced and sometime stressful job but if you can handle that walmart is a good place to work for the pay and benefits offered.,5,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,North Carolina,12/7/20,2020,12,7

Ymmv,"Of course everyone has different experiences, but I definitely believe I lucked out with the store I work at. It has the usual problems walmarts have, where managers expect too much from a team of too little people, but overall the managers get out there and help when the going gets rough, including the store manager. Each department works together like a team and when they're not too far behind on their own work, are perfectly willing to help out in other departments. Unless you're part time, you won't have a very good work/life balance. Full time associates only have 2 days off a week, usually non-consecutively. The three main day shifts are 7AM - 4PM, 10AM - 7PM and 1PM - 10PM. The schedules aren't set, so you can work 1-10 Wednesday and 7-4 Thursday, but if you close your availability to 7-4 5 days you won't get enough hours to pay the bills.They also provide a dollar-a-day college program for select schools and programs, so that's a nice benefit.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"New Bern, NC",12/7/20,2020,12,7

Jewel associate,Its Walmart not to much to say. It's a job that will barely pay the bills. If you just need a job it's great I dont know how people can stay for 5+ years. Most of management was a favorite of someone that's how they got promoted. You do sometimes find some good managers. The way you know them is the associates under them will do anything for them. Most of the store managers are useless. The store I worked at was one that was known for losing store managers. I ended up doing my job as well as my department managers but since she was a favorite with management they wouldn't do anything. ,1,Former Employee,Sales associate ,"Mesa, AZ",12/7/20,2020,12,7

Management is not good and they are rude ,"I have a lot of years of experience in customer service and I will say after working there less than 30 days I quit. It is not the job for me!!! The management is rude and do not try to help a new employee with anything. They expect the computer training you did that is outdated to teach you everything about where they put you like cashier or bakery, etc... when it doesn't teach you everything at all. They don't try to make sure that someone is there to replace you for your break or time to go home and they threaten to write you up if you clock out one minute late because they wouldn't let you leave.

I have been working for the company for 7 years making $16.83/hr...ehhh not the best pay rate. Also, management for the store is terrible, people’s hours are being cut all the time (especially during bonus time). Walmart is the pure epitome and the image of MURICA’.

Sometimes you'll be micromanaged, but most of the time management is pretty hands off.Stress can be high so there is a lot of turnover, not just at the grunt level but at the management level as well.Hours are hit-miss, although the job is steady.

It is a job. It would not be so bad if the management wasn't forced to hit such impossible task times.,"i worked at walmart for almost 5 years. I was really excited at first but it quickly evaporated when i saw that it didn't matter how hard you worked or how good your attendance was. It mattered if you stroked the managers egos. There is only about 25% of the staff that work hard and care about the work they do. Also most people treat the customers like trash...even the managers. If the managers weren't 22 year old college grads with ZERO retail experience and would actually listen to the staff that has been there longer than them, they would learn something. Instead they act like they know everything and they have a giant chip on their shoulders. VERY UNFAIR treatment. Management and personal will lie to your face and pretend they know the answer when they do not...just to get you to stop asking and go away. Corporate also recently got rid of several positions with almost no notice and no lateral positions to move into. People that have been there 20-30 years just toyed around like they were nothing more than a damaged piece of freight that fell off the truck. If you are lazy and want a paycheck with a couple of sick days a year, this is the place for you. If you are a hard worker and expect to move up the ranks quickly...go to target.

Good place to work short-term but I would avoid working at Walmart long-term. Upper management is usually clueless and customers can be rude.,Terrible management that regularly abuses its employees by expecting you to do higher pay grade jobs without the pay. The workplace has terrible moral with everyone hating their job . The good workers will be expected to do the work of 2-3 people to pick up for the slackers with no reward. Moving into management was difficult before they got rid of half the management positions now your only hope is being really good at brown nosing. Management at the store level is bad but the district management can be as bad with one telling employees that had legitimate issues with their equipment to stop making excuses instead of fixing the problem (computers constantly freezing due to old servers in the store which drastically reduced work flow).  If you are young and just starting out the plus side is that the pay is better than a lot of entry level jobs but I would not recommend this soul crushing experience to anyone.,1,Current Employee,Walmart Associate ,"Caro, MI",12/5/20,2020,12,5

Could Be Better," I work on the unloading and stocking team, daily task could revolved around helping team members with unloading trucks and stocking.

The pay and benefits are great compared to almost any other retail company, in my experience. The hours are long, (10 minimum for Salary) and training isn't always the best. Sometimes its a sink or swim situation but if you are self-motivated and willing to learn by trial and error, you can get up to speed just fine, for the most part. There is a great network of help at your fingertips, whether it be a colleague, a market manager or even a home office associate. However, Already having to put in 10 hours a day, you can very easily find yourself working well over 11 or 12 hours. Depending on the business needs and what department you are running, it is sort of an unspoken rule to stay until your work for the day is completed. There are MANY times that I felt that I had to stay later, ending my work week well over almost 60 hours and there is no OT because, again, you are salaried. There are so many moving parts to any given Walmart location, you are expected to look at the total business aspect which many times pulls you away from what your specific duties are. There is just a lot going on behind the scenes that some people don't realize and it can definitely affect your balance in maintaining a healthy work/life medium. Sometimes management can get too caught up with all the different tasks that are being juggled and the atmosphere sometimes gets to feeling very ""you are on your own"" because no one wants to delay their own projects in fear of having to stay even later. That being said, the team atmosphere with - more...",4,Current Employee,Front End Manager ,"San Jose, CA",12/3/20,2020,12,3

Then they complain even though they stand around and do nothing the whole day.Toxic work environment overall, customers aren’t pleasant to be around either. Doing returns and other thing that aren’t meant to be my job is also not fun. Walmart can’t be bothered to pay cashiers at least 15 an hour for all the workload.

"Its fine for a job, not a career.","If you are a young person looking for a job to save up some money, go for it. There are long days and the work is hard and tiring but with 2 fifteen minute breaks and an hour unpaid lunch its not too bad. Just make sure you arent late and don't leave early, or you'll rack up points quick. There is always a distinct air of favoritism and you're likely to be understaffed and overworked. The work is easy to learn but incredibly mindless, and not in a good way. Its also very likely you'll come in to find you arent just doing your work but also the work of other departments and shifts (hence the understaffing issue) moving up is almost impossible unless you can stick it out for over 5 years in the same position, and raises are hard to come by.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cicero, NY",12/3/20,2020,12,3

"Unless you have to, don't.","I was a Front End CSM for walmart. It was not quite as stressful as some of my other positions but that honestly was only because I was getting paid more than I ever had been previously. Walmart is the biggest employer in my hometown, and short of the oilfield, it was one of the best paying too. that should give you a good perspective on how poor my area is. Walmart is a absolutely awful place to work. the schedule is unreliable. I was lucky enough to become a full time employee and thus was somewhat protected from hour cuts. you could go from consistently working a soild 25-35 hours a week to 10 easy. any time 'bonuses' came around, management would immediately take them back by hour slashing. Communication was nil. management could barely be bothered to attend work. We were without a store manager for 8+ months because they could not get someone to take the position. I was responsible as a CSM for 25-40+ people depending on the shift and oftentimes I would be one of two on the floor managers scheduled for the ENTIRE day. the work load is impossible in normal circumstances, but with the advent of COVID i have zero clue how the staff is able to continue. Especially in light of the recent manager cuts. Walmart has used COVID as an excuse to axe half of the management team in every single store for no good reason. I may have beef with the way upper management handled things, but it has far more to do with a chronic LACK of staff, not an overabundance. it is ridiculous to me how poorly run walmart is on the store level.If you have to work there, I understand.

The terrible management. ,"For the first few years I worked here, it was manageable. Nowadays, every member of management has their own agenda and does whatever they can to make themselves look good to their higher ups. The store environment has changed so drastically in a negative way since I started three years ago that I am now unwilling to recommend working here. Covid precautions are a joke, no hazard or holiday pay, nearly impossible to take off for emergency events/ appointments, and as previously stated the management may as well not exist. You will not move up unless you do absolutely everything in your power to make yourself look good in front of management.

Good if you are a student or looking for something short term. ,Walmart worked around my college scheduling pretty well. Once i was done with school and working full time it was not that great of an experience. I worked their before they added the company who takes care of all post paid phones. So they fixed the issue of having and expecting to know about every electronic device and product we sell. You would get boomers who need help with their phone and because you are young and work around TV’s and video games automatically means that you should know about everything. I remember a time that a customer Asked me if I had seen a particular movie and if I knew one of the supporting actors in it. I politely told them no I had not and they continue to ridicule me and said things along the lines that I work their in electronics I should know these things. Outside of that electronics is higher end product so that department everything is basically locked up and you’re constantly running around just to unlock a case.

Challenging work place,Walmart was a great place to work till politics. I learned a lot from my department manager. Walmart needs a new face it's old. The best part of the job is the customers.,4,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Marysville, CA",12/1/20,2020,12,1
Fun but stressful ,"People think being a cashier is so easy just scanning groceries but it’s the hardest job in the store. You are stuck on a register all day everyday you have to deal with customers attitudes when stuff is not the price it was on the shelf the customer is down your throat like you’re the one typing the prices as you go, if the store is busy you could forget about a bathroom break or your lunch unless you are about to lock out. Good thing Walmart made the system to were after working 5 hours without a break you lock out of the system so you can’t use your log in to get into the system until you’ve had your lunch. And when your lunch is over THEY ARE LOOKING FOR You CALLING YOU ON THE INTERCOM BACK TO THE REGISTER",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Baton Rouge, LA",12/1/20,2020,12,1
"Good place to work, meet a lot of different people, from all walks of life.","Its very hard to keep up with the constantly changing management, and associates, every few days your working with someone new. One day you can be productive, next day you have a new co-worker, who only does certain duties. Your work load doubles. If they need you in other areas of the store, better learn fast, a lot of customers get upset because the associates are standing in for other associates, without much knowledge in that department, which doesn't help the customer at all. ",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Reading, PA",12/1/20,2020,12,1
Productive and exciting ,"Not much to say, we didn't directly interact with the customers or many of the employees. We came late at night and usually left before anyone knew we there.",5,Former Employee,Prime Retail Services ,"Cullman, AL",12/1/20,2020,12,1
Bad managers,Co workers and some managers were good. But most managers didn't know what they were doing. I wouldn't recommend working for Walmart. But they do have flexible scheduling. ,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Littleton, CO",12/1/20,2020,12,1

Its walmart,It's Wal-Mart that pretty much sums everything you need to know up everything is what you make it I guess especially when you need to work but I'd avoid being employed again here,3,Former Employee,Cashier/ Inventory Management Specialist ,"Yorktown, VA",12/1/20,2020,12,1
"Easy Going Job, Creepy Coworkers",It’s and easy going job for someone just starting out or someone that doesn’t want something too hard. there’s not a lot you have to learn other than how to properly deal with customers. i learned a lot about customer service at my first two jobs so this job became quite easy. ,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier/Customer Service/Stock ,"Desloge, MO",12/1/20,2020,12,1

Disasterous place to work,They deny raises or reviews. Over work employees. No holiday pay . they claim to be family oriented but have fired people for taking care of family. Any bonus you could expect goes to management instead.,1,Former Employee,Tle associate ,"Tyler, TX",12/1/20,2020,12,1
Pay,Payday is a plus. Work in typical production environment. Four day work week is a plus. Working in a safe environment with minimal climate control.    ,1,Former Employee,PFC Encoder ,"Spring Valley, IL",12/1/20,2020,12,1
Its okay. Not for ppl who are lazy,"Need better communication between shifts but good money. Not so nice employees. Some managers pick favorites, long hours super short breaks 15 minutes",3,Current Employee,Module Lead ,"Spartanburg, SC",12/1/20,2020,12,1
"Fast paced, interesting day to day ",Depends on your job. I’ve worked in the pharmacy for 5 years. It had reached its point of burned out. Some upper management are rude. They think they can talk to you any kind of way. Direct supervisor is good. Tight knit group due to being a smaller group. The pay could be better and hazardous pay would be a plus due to dealing with COVID patients routinely now. ,3,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Muskogee, OK",12/1/20,2020,12,1
Good First Job,Managers like to play favorites. work can be fun. busy days slow days.

Toxic work environment ,"I like how they give us long breaks and meal breaks. This job is good enough either experienced or your first job. The customers are okay. But I give this a 1 star because I don’t like the way I’m being treated. My coworkers they just ignore me with giving me dirty looks while others they say hi to each other and make small talk and even friends. So actually this job is not good for someone who belongs to protected characters (eg: age, disability, race, sexuality, etc), that’s why my coworkers treat me like they don’t like me and I’m friendly. ",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"San Jose, CA",11/30/20,2020,11,30
Not Fun,"the training is short and the schedule sucks, the work isn't fulfilling but it pays the bills if you need it. they kind of throw you in the deep end in your first week",1,Current Employee,Associate ,"Portland, OR",11/30/20,2020,11,30
So many angry employees ,There are so many people who are angry and it makes me not want to be there. They complain about others not doing what they’re supposed to but to me it seems like the companys fault for poor training and procedures. Also the pay is terrible. These people work their butts off to get $11 an hour. Walmart needs to set the example and pay their hard working employees more. ,1,Current Employee,Cap Team 1 Associate ,Oklahoma,11/30/20,2020,11,30
Hours and pay are good..,"I've not worked in the OGP department at Walmart for very long and so far it's descent. There's much to learn very quickly so its been stressful,  but I've had help from a few of my coworkers.  Oddly enough,  I had very little if any help or support from management.  It also seems their lacking in providing associates with an abundance of working equipment which makes getting work finished much more of a challenge.  Now the other thing that I don't care for is their point/occurrence  system because things come up in life in a 6 month period and you can only get 5 before termination.. On a good note though:  they did get me into my position quickly,  the hours are great, and the pay is pretty good as well!!! ",4,Former Employee,Online Grocery Picker ,"Oak Ridge, TN",11/30/20,2020,11,30
Meet all types of people,I worked there part time when I was a undergraduate student. My managers would adjust my work schedule to fit in with my school schedule. I often got pulled to work in different departments that I had no clue about.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Morrisville, NC",11/30/20,2020,11,30
Fun to work,Enjoyed working at walmart. Flexible schedule. Team work was a must. Management wants you to be successful. Pay isn't the best. Good starting point for someone new in the workforce ,5,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Raleigh, NC",11/30/20,2020,11,30

"Easy enough, fun even","It’s basically just stocking, cleaning, and helping customers. It’s fun whe you bond with your co-workers. There’s a good amount of happy friendships there. Management changes every 2 years. Some are just not good. As long as you can find a way to stay busy you will be okay. Pays just minimum wage. But it’s has great breaks and freedom.

Better than Amazon,"A slightly better job than Amazon. Bottom level warehousing at it's best. If you have any experience, you will wonder why you are there. I took the job after a divorce. It helped keep the lights on.",1,Current Employee,Equipment Operator ,"Edgerton, KS",11/30/20,2020,11,30
Wage and managment,The people who work there were the only reason why stayed as long as i did. The work wasnt nearly matched as the pay. We were short handed and were told we would get fired for not getting production done. Yet being paid as low as possible. ,1,Former Employee,Sales Assosiate ,"Rice Lake, WI",11/30/20,2020,11,30
Poor management,"The management is poor at best. When you get to know them as a person they are good people, but their management skill are beyond poor. They lie about the freight times to make it look like it can be done, when in all actuality by the end of the shift you're still behind. It seems like everyday they add a new task that was supposed to be completed by the shift beforehand and never seem to take into account the time it takes to do other tasks. There is never enough equipment for everyone and the equipment they do have only works half the time. ",2,Current Employee,O/N Dairy Stocker ,"Rolla, MO",11/30/20,2020,11,30
 Working for Walmart in Bangor has been the best transfer to a very exceptionally managed and run store.,"I have worked for Walmart for 20 years am presently in overnight facility Maintenance and cross-trained in several departments Cashier,  stocker, maintenance (janitorial facility support) dairy. I have worked in Houston Tx, Memphis Tenn, Richmond Tx, and now Bangor Maine. The store has an excellent management team and is very accommodating as Walmart has been my anchor job for many years through many life changes and I continue to enjoy working there.

",5,Current Employee,Overnight Maintenance Associate ,"Bangor, ME",11/30/20,2020,11,30
Honestly the worst place I have ever worked,"I have had so many roles at Walmart, and they always ended the same way. There is a huge lack in communication between managers. They do not know or agree on company policies, they never remember to write down or save anyone's day off requests so the schedule constantly gets messed up. They expect way too much out of sales associates, and are constantly understaffed. I would not recommend even my enemies work there. It is an awful place where the managers do not care about any given associate unless they are related. ",1,Former Employee,Health Ambassador/Fabrics and Crafts ,Pennsylvania,11/30/20,2020,11,30

If you work OGP you’ll have a miserable time ,They pay isn’t enough for the amount of work you do especially during a pandemic. I couldn’t pay bills with the checks I was receiving but I felt like I was working nonstop.,2,Former Employee,OGP Associate ,"Alpharetta, GA",11/30/20,2020,11,30
The managment was bad but i loved my job.,My job was easy and I was was good at it both working the register and working the self checkout isles. I got unfair attendance deductions because I used to ride the bus to work I explained before they ever even hired me I told them I rode the bus after school from Canton to massillon which took 2 hours everyday on the way there and the way back. They would also consistently schedule me on days the bus doesn't run and when I couldn't come they'd use it against me The deductions led to them wanting to get rid of me due to my attendance. The managment was bad there was a lot of inappropriate actions between the managers in the front of the store. my only problem with the main manager is that she would schedule me to early on school days and schedule me on days I couldn't come to work.,2,Former Employee,Cashier/self Checkout Supervisor ,"Massillon, OH",11/30/20,2020,11,30
Bad mangement,"The managers here are horrible including the store manager, they treat everyone like they're not human. DO NOT WORK HERE. A typical day of work is horrible they expect one person to do everything on their own. They say we are supposed to work as a team but I do not agree because they get upset if they see you talking to your coworker. Also when you ask to change your hours they get upset because you haven't worked here for  a certain amount of time but they need to realize most of their workers are minors in school who are often needing to change it because of activities. It is mentally draining to work here. ",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Tewksbury, MA",11/30/20,2020,11,30
Walmart is a great company they just cut hours ,"I’ve been working at Walmart for a while now. It is a good company to work for.

Unfair ,"Let’s say you stay with the company for over a year working your absolute hardest and giving your all . All you get is a 50 cent raise yearly in February, nothing else . They don’t wear mask half the time and when I worked in electronics they would leave me out there even though there’s supposed to be 2 people and if you get scammed or robbed out of money you get fired without a second thought . They seem all amazing on the outside but they are horrible. ",1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Calhoun, GA",11/30/20,2020,11,30

Pharmacy is not a good place to work ,"Pharmacy is extremely demanding with no work life balance. They will not work with you if your kid has a dance recital or dr appointment. Forget getting off for a family trip on the holidays. They say they rotate the closing shifts and you will only work 1 a week, but you will really work closer to 2 or 3.

Everyone out for themselves ,"I worked there for four years. I personally loved ""the job description"" I disliked the way it was run. If u stay on the worksheet plan then things get done properly. They do not. You have to fight for yourself to get help, to get answers to questions. There is retaliation if you do not stop your job to help a ""favorite"" employee. Its overall the head management. You tell them any concerns and they do not react. I've heard them at the smokers table making fun of other employees. I couldn't believe it. It's a stressful work environment, you feel unsure of each day. I was let go due to the fact I fell on black ice went to the doctor which determined that I had tore my muscles and I also had a floating bone chip in my hip. They requested 3days off. I took my days off using ppto (protected paid time off) but was still let go close to a week later.

They don't plan ahead when it comes to scheduling, so there's always staffing issues.  That's especially an issue on weekends.

There were 2 occasions where I was forced to sign things against my will and when I tried to open door a Wright up that I shouldn’t have been given it was tossed to the side and not cared about. There are many things that have happened at this job that made me end up hating it. But me and my coworkers were close. And I enjoyed being around them.

A company that doesn’t care about you,During this time with covid on the rise.

There has been 25 cases of covid in the building and that number has been on the rise and half the people in the building are either not wearing there masks or wearing them incorrectly. They don’t care about you or your family if your child’s school or daycare is closed they expect you still to come and and push out mandatory overtime and work on the holidays. ,1,Former Employee,Breakpack Orderfiller ,"Tobyhanna, PA",11/27/20,2020,11,27

Poor disrespectful management. Impossible expectations. Extremely monotonous.,"A typical day at Walmart consists of stocking freight and helping customers. The job itself is easy and in all honesty it isn't hard work for the amount of money you're paid. The problems arise when you start to work there for a couple of weeks and management starts to go hard at you. In my experience, they will berate you and make comments to other members of management in front of you. I have witnessed management make a grown man upset by embrassing him during meetings. The general consensus at the Walmart I work at is that management is unorganized and have a nasty attitude. They don't communicate so one ASM may have you do one thing and another asks you to do something else at the other end of the store. Walmart has just done an organizational change and it seems to have made things worse. Now there are way too many ""management"" positions to effectively run the store. In addition, certain department managers are completely ignorant of disabilities and expect you to finish tasks within a half hour. This job is a joke.",1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Apex, NC",11/26/20,2020,11,26
Overall what you would expect from working at Walmart,"Higher pay than most places. 11.50 to start off as cashier and more so to work in Curbside. Many employees I knew were fresh out of high school within a year or so, others were already graduated with non-usable degree or older. It was easy work for what you did. Customer service skills are needed for interacting with people of all types at the front of the store and knowledge of the items within the store for other areas. The most effort you will spend doing is chatting with other associates and navigating your way through store gossip. Work culture is different in different area Walmarts but associates are generally very chatty from all stores. Sociability is a must and if you're elderly, fresh out of high school and wanting a higher paying job or stuck with a useless degree, this job is for you. Not very difficult work, very leisurely and most of the time you're either interacting with other associates or customers.Also the company will definitely pay for your tuition or partial tuition, so for any young or future associates at Walmart, be sure to ask your HR about those benefits if you're looking to further your education.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Waco, TX",11/26/20,2020,11,26

They just expect you to be available all day long every single day and really frown and pinch their faces up if god forbid you can't offer every single second of your time to them.  I guess they only want employees that don't have kids or other jobs (cause who can actually live on 11/hour x 25-35 hours a week) or any other committments ore responsbilities at all.  And you're told the shifts will be 4-5 hours, but they are NOT.  You get scheduled for 7-9 hours.  Its exhausting.  I get the other reviews that say stuff like they wear you out, or run you down.  It's true.   I don't know why american companies think peoplle give better customer service when they are worn out and in pain from standing all day.

Excellent computer system that is virtually bullet proof safe for dispensing meds,"Exceptionally high daily expectations and measures to race and finish till the end of the day. Key focus from management is on customer compliance scores, completing compliance calls and actively encourage patients to take their meds properly, get 90 days and refill/pickups completion. Vaccinations are another key metric . Ask everyone at counsel and offer not just one but 2 vaccines. To add to all this immunizing we also do basic screening such asBlood pressure checks, cholesterol and glucose.We now charge for those services and patients aren’t interested in getting blood drawn nor paying For this in a grocery store.

horrible management,"You are constantly asked for more than what is reasonable and fair. For example, stocking the store while also preparing a certain number of chickens in the deli and making sure it's clean. Most of the management never appreciates workers by giving any kind of praise.

"Great Coworkers, decent pay, terrible management","The job of Cap 2 consisted of unloading one or two trucks at the beginning of the day and later, stocking shelves and/or pulling freight. My coworkers were all very nice and fun. The supervisors, not so much. Upper management is ALWAYS angry about everything. You can never meet their productivity standards. Management makes the lives of your supervisors a nightmare, which will in turn make yours a nightmare too. Can include some heavy lifting. Always expect to be told you aren't working fast enough. I cannot stress enough how cruel management can be. The pay was decent I guess, but they bent head over heels to not give workers overtime.

"Very Chaotic, Reasonable Pay, Difficult Scheduling, Very Diverse and Inclusive","As long as you can handle retail chaos turned up to 11, and not take your work stress home with you, Walmart isn't a bad place to work. The main issue with working there is that at any given point you feel like you're being pulled in six different directions due to the laundry list of tasks that pile up over your day. Whether it's due to multiple managers wanting you to do different things, customers making a mess of your department, the shift before you leaving you their unfinished work, or your teammates not getting their work done, you can never really be sure what your day is going to have in store for you.Walmart pays pretty well compared to a lot of other retail locations, especially in direct service departments like the deli and electronics. It's also a fairly easy job to keep so long as you don't have issues with attendance. Scheduling can be very difficult but it largely depends on your department and your manager, if you don't have open availability you may not get as many hours and it's very difficult to plan your life with the way their scheduling works. The managers at my store were actually very friendly and easy to work with though, but this will vary by location. The associates there were a mixed bag as you can expect with any large amount of people. Most of the long-term adult employees were easy to get along with and always willing to help, but Walmart also hires a LOT of teenagers who can be very difficult to work with.Their workplace culture is generally pretty positive but again, this varies a lot by store.

If you can’t do the overtime you will get written up and likely fired for not being “loyal” to the company.

it’s like a high school,"The work environment is REALLY toxic. It’s mostly made up of high schoolers and young adults and adults that act like children. Management isn’t really good at anything really, they just stand around and yell at you the minute you’re not doing something. There’s always drama and the only way to get an issue taken care of is if you go straight to ethics. Our team is always overworked and understaffed so drama and tensions do rise and it becomes everyone’s business. The pay is actually so sad and there’s like people who’ve been working there since it opened or just very long in general and they get paid the same as someone who just started. It’s just a very depressing place in general I only work there because they hired me in like 3 days due to the pandemic.

Strict and Too much favoritism ,"I work as a seasonal worker, weekend night shift during peak season, and you don't even know who's the leader and stuff. I did putwall, but they keep moving me to pack because this guy (I don't even know what his role is) is a friend with lots of putwaller, and they don't want to pack, so he always moves me to pack. Night shift weekend has horrible management. Some of the orange vest people are racist too. When you do the same thing as everyone, you're the only one who gets told not to do it but right in front of me, a different race is doing the same thing, but they don't get exposed to do anything.

I come from an office environment, so being a low level retail associate isn't my dream job, but for the time being it is the job I choose & it suits its purpose just fine.  Overall, for the most part, managers treat associates with respect & coworkers in general treat peers respectfully - after 2 yrs, I've noticed that those who don't put in any effort or treat others poorly are generally short lived in their employment at Walmart.

Revamp the company,Walmart can be a good job if management pulls their weight.There is alot of favortisim.Support managers cant finish a department because they choose not to so the next day employees have to finish their work.Too much gossiping on the clock with managers and foul language is used constantly by managers.Overall the employees do all the work.They work certain employees harder than others.There is no hot water in the bathrooms to wash hands especially during Covid.This company needs to pay attention to the employees because we are the ones that get the job done to make the managers &support managers look good with no good bonuses.,1,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Jacksonville, FL",11/21/20,2020,11,21
Work culture ,"Walmart is a great company to work, the only thing is it’s a lot lazy people and office managers.

They don't care at all about the people who work for them. Don't listen to people who say you can make a career there because soon they will be eliminated also. Inexperienced managers talk down to associates like they are children. They promote this ideology that if your a manager your better than everyone else. Its a disgusting company.

Lack of support from management,"Management leaves the cashiers to enforce the mask mandate and purchase limits without supporting the cashiers when the customer becomes irate and violent. The CSM's all hide when a customer is acting up and hang in a group to talk to each other. Supplies required to do the job like gloves and masks are hard to obtain. Your 15 minute break is really 10 minutes since they count the time you walk to and from the breakroom as part of your ""break"".

They were at the forefront of employee health with their response to Covid, by liberal leave, sanitizing the place, providing PPE and protecting the customers through sanitation practices.They put a high emphasis on the value of their customers, which leads to good practices.Tragically, some of that doesn't filter down to the store level at times.

The book seems to change as to what is sent to them to enforce. I was never told what a point t means and do not understand even one half point. i come from a energized company that never treated employees on the fly i have always had after 30 years of work 100 percent available and always exceeded what was given me to fulfill.

Typically easy and straightforward entry level job. ,"One of my complaints I have as a Walmart associate is the tiers of pay between easy to work positions such as electronics associate,AP host, OGP who all get paid more than my position CAP 2. I never understood how we could be treated differently and paid less than others for effectively doing more exhausting work. Cap 2 is hard labor and is arguably the most demanding Walmart job so it makes zero sense to not pay us the same as the other positions or even more. Walmart should pay every starting associate the same to prevent hostility between associates.Unrealistic expectations for zoning, stocking are sometimes a factor so it can be stressful at times so just do your best.  Apart from that my managers have been flexible for my school and treat me well because I am a hard worker. ",4,Current Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Downey, CA",11/19/20,2020,11,19

The communication with our leaders is underwhelming. Everyone wants to be in control of the momentum of the store which can then cause clashes in the routine necessary for our company. How we conduct and talk to one another is also an accountability that most our leaders seem to not follow.

The management though, they were always on some sort of power trip. There seemed to be minimal communication through management and even if you were swamped, they would just walk by and tell you to go do something else, like they somehow can't see that you are already struggling to get through what you are doing.

Not a long term job,"Walmart is a good place to work in that you get 1 hour of sick time for every 17 hours worked (the most I have currently seen in my 4 jobs). You also get good breaks. They claim to be very open about having a flexible schedule, but at my location, you were more likely to get fired over little things if you didn't have completely open availability. The HR representative definitely plays favorites at my location and was clearly less willing to work with you if she decided she didn't like you. Schedules are often ridiculous, and have you opening 2 days, then closing, then opening again. They also tend to not schedule enough people in certain areas. In terms of longevity at the company, you are only ever hired at first as a temp, and then you are required to work your way up from there. They also have a very high turnover rate, as almost the entire staff was either fired or quit during my time there. The only other plus is that your immediate manager and your coworkers are all super friendly and during my time there, it felt almost like a second family.

I had people who had been there for 10 years making a dollar over minimum wage and Management making a few dollars over. Its not good pay until you get super high up into salary pay. Then I heard you have no life. My walmart was friendly staff except a few team leads. High turnover rate. They worked with my schedule, and everything was consistent and made me feel welcomed. I think it really depends on the store, because I had a friend who worked at Prescott Valley and she said they were not willing to work with her schedule and were more strict and not as friendly. I didn't like having an hour lunch, because I just wanted to get home earlier and it was unpaid. I  heard that the benefits are good. I also think that it's fun to work with the public and meet all different types of people. I also liked being a cashier because its very busy and time flew by. They also are very good at giving breaks. They give you a break every 2 hours. I have worked jobs where they give ypu no breaks so I'm happy to see walmart actually gives breaks consistently. Overall it's a good job for a person starting out, or a student. I think it would take a long time to make decent money at walmart and you will have to get pretty lucky as there's few high paying jobs and lots of employees fighting for the positions.

Nice job ,It’s a good job to have while in school because the pay isn’t bad and the hours aren’t too bad either (part-time).

Great As Long As Your Not A Cashier ,"The Good parts are that when you work on the sales floor you get to move around and you get to somewhat decide your own breaks and can go to the bathroom whenever.

I would only work here if you can't find something better,They will put you anywhere because they are always short handed. Some of the management is good but most of them only care about them selfs.

There were quarterly bonuses based off store performance so it really was a team effort.ManagementIn general, managers at Walmart will help you to an extent but then treat you like you're ignorant.

Working there is fun and easy but not many people!,The job is fun it’s was my second day today. It’s excited working at Walmart and greeting people the best way ever. I love it all. The only problem is that there’s not many people working. So far it seems the most work that’s done is Cart pushers which I am and front door assistants.

First time job,"I worked in the new Online Grocery Pickup department of Walmart which, as far as I could tell, one of the most physically taxing jobs in the store. This department received higher pay than the others, automotive did as well, but they required their employees to take out extremely heavy pallets that were stacked with crates that had a lot of groceries in them. People did grocery shopping that would last them months in this department. We took them out, no matter the weather, and loaded them as well. We did this non-stop all shift which was very taxing. The department manager didn't help, just shouted and took more breaks than was allowed. Most of the time it felt like the manager wasn't even there. Sometimes customers would be waiting for over an hour because the entire system wouldn't be working (manager doing nothing) and they would yell at the dispensers like they were the problem.

Change isn’t for the better,"Back when I first started working here, it was great. Everyone was super friendly and they do give you a very good song and dance to get you interested. But recent changes has made everyone that I interact with here miserable. Management relays very little, if any, information. No more CSMs up from means the cashiers are stuck waiting for approvals and/overrides on things we can do ourselves. A lot of confusion about who’s in charge at a specific time.

poor work life balance ,This company does not care bout your life outside of work. My family does not live in the same town nor state as I do.

I had to argue and fight with them about see my family (who lives half way across the country from me). Now I am dealing with them same thing for Christmas. Walmart wants me to be alone for Christmas just so I can work for them? Im sorry I thought this was a “family” business. How does someone not let a person be with family for the holidays?

Walmart ,"I was originally hired as a temporary worker due to covid and was brought on full time due to my other job not being able to bring me back. At first, it was a great experience. The management was grateful for employees. But once the restructuring started to happen, they started letting long term employees go, expecting too much of employees and not doing the hiring that we so desperately needed. Expecting us to do the job of 8 to 10 people when there was 4 of us. I was extremely disappointed with how the restructuring happened. They didn't give long term employees the positions that they deserved and gave them to people who they thought they would be able to control and bully into things. Do not work here.

Avoid Walmart!!! Walmart is a HORRIBLE place to work!,"I have worked at Walmart for some years and while it was bearable at times, it has never been a great place to work and with all the recent restructuring Walmart has gotten ten times worse. Management gives you unrealistic workloads and you will be treated like a number, better yet, you will be treated like less than a number. They do not care about you. They do not see you as a person. It does not matter if you work hard, follow the rules and try to do the right thing because these are the ones they continuously put more on. The more you do the more they expect you to do and try to push you to do and when you just cannot do anymore they will write you up. Per policy, you are allowed to call out using protected paid time off for when you get ill or those unknow situations that arise, but you better believe you will be held accountable for doing so. If you have issues the People Lead or HR person is never available and whatever you do, DO NOT follow their instructions on calling ethics, the associate human resources line, the open door line or anything else because management will just retaliate against you.

The problem is the unrealistic time requirements (set by corporate) burn you out after a while. Towards the end I dreaded going to work everyday. I'd get called into the office for not going fast enough - making me feel hopeless and always on edge. I stayed far longer then I should have because I liked the people.

I’ve been at this job for several years and I’ve at least since 25 people come and go either fired or just quit. It would be too much of a bad job if management didn’t treat their employees like Hebrew slaves. Honestly I haven’t heard a thank you or a good job or felt appreciated in months, plus no one got any raises this year we were supposed to get them annually, plus I make less compared to all the new people and work triple as hard as they do. Also whatever isn’t done in the morning automatically becomes the person who closes responsibility even if there is five people working in the morning and one at night. Recently I developed anxiety working there as well as other health problems do to the extremely toxic work environment I also in the past suffer from depression and I’m pretty sure I’m depressed at this point again thanks to this job.

Manager, which I don't recommend unless you at least work with them a bit, to better understand the processes they work with) Unfortunately, when it comes to a retail store as big as Walmart, it's prone to change (YOU MUST ACCEPT THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE AND WILL CHANGE ALL THE TIME!!!) and all the good Assistant Managers that I started with moved on to other stores or bigger and better things. This was mainly due to our horrible store manager at the time but never the less we were stuck with leftover inexperienced managers of whom the only experience they seemed to have was what they learned at the academy. This lead to me eventually being fired from the company.

Awful management,"Walmart allows assistant managers to bully, harass, and terrorize hourly associates. Your job regularly gets threatened, you get publicly screamed at in the backroom to be made ""an example"" out of, and all reports about their behaviors get ignored. You get scheduled outside of your availability and HR refuses to fix it for you, if you can ever get a hold of them. Your schedule changes the afternoon before an early morning shift and when you call out you are berated over it. Time off is rarely approved and the workload is tremendous for the pay you get. Customers are allowed to physically threaten you and COVID precuations were a joke when the assistant manager threatens to coach (i.e. penalize or fire) associates for calling out sick or taking a mandatory medical leave of absence, meanwhile management can take several.

It used to be where management cared about you, knew your family, and was here for you. It’s very sad what the company is doing. Good long term associates are no longer valued, some make less or the same as new associates, and their jobs are being eliminated.

Gloomy work environment quotas are more important than relief,"In my time working there, we were constantly understaffed. People transferring or quitting and management often misses the mark on what needs to be addressed such as pulling people from already strained workloads in a section, oftentimes leaving the section under staffed, and improperly allocating extra people to help out in different sections or encouraging half of the workforce in a section to start zoning or facing said section when there are still pallets of freight that need to be worked causing the entire zone to not finish",3,Former Employee,Overnight Grocery Stocker ,"West Sacramento, CA",11/9/20,2020,11,9

Also worth mentioning there isn't any assistant manager assigned to that location and other managers don't know how the area works (can't blame them though).Aside from that, it used to be great (like a 5 star) when they had supervisors and the COVID leave policy didn't exist for people to abuse.

Overnights arent worth it ,"You get paid 50 cents more than the minimum, just to miss out on everything in your life during the day. My life was work, come home, shower, eat, sleep. They didn't have materials for work such as gloves or box cutters for weeks on end. The equipment needed to move freight is limited and always in use so you spend a good 30 minutes trying to START work, only to be set behind because of the delay. They give you an ungodly amount of work for your shift. Anything previous shift doesn't finish becomes your job  they hire unreliable teenagers for the day shift, which translates into nothing getting done during the day and twice the amount of work falling onto the overnight shift. Don't even think about trying to change your schedule to days, because they won't create availability even though those unreliable teenagers call off 3-4 times a week every week yet they still retain their positions, but if you call out once or twice it becomes a problem.You work into the morning of your days off.

Majority of managers are low down and abuse their power,Working for Walmart was a below mediocre experience and from my experience there's basically categories to how everything works alot of management will talk behind your back or take any anger they have out on you when someone from corporate let's them know their screwing up which is crazy because the corporate members were really chill and understanding.

If you need emergency time off with less than 24 hr notice and have no protected time off accumulated, they will ""point "" you.  4 points and you're gone.Pay & benefitsMy pay and benefits at Walmart are questionable at best.  Benefits are very good..health,  life insurance offered. 401k is offered.  Personal time off accumulates through the year to use for vacation or other time off reasons. Pay  not so good.  They do not compensate long term associates when they increase entry level pay. So they have new hires making as much or more than 20 & 30 yrs associates.Job security and advancementIn terms of job security at Walmart, I think it's ok until someone else wants your position.  If you do your job,  there's usually not a problem,  but, they will demote you if they have someone else that wants the position or they want to put in that position.ManagementIn general, managers at Walmart are like any other.

"Good people, good work environment, a lot of work","Worked as a stocking academy trainer (managerial role) for a neighborhood market. If you want to work for Walmart as a part time worker or as a second job, it's a great opportunity. There's a lot of work to do but the people were great. You collect PTO the more you work and they're pretty forgiving.However, if you're looking to try to move up in the company DON'T. Walmart got rid of a lot of management roles thus the work of 3 managers is now the work of 1. They will overwork you and even if you do all your tasks, they're never satisfied. Taking on the academy trainer role isn't worth the stress or the money (1.10 raise from base pay)  and you're better off looking elsewhere if you want to grow with a company.

You can bust your hump working extra days and extra hours ( a lot of the time mandatory) and you won't even get a thank you, in fact they may disregard everything you did and try to point out everything you didn't do.

Managment and human resources are corrupted,"There is no job security at walmart human resources ivonne and verna from the walmart in fontana are condescending and unprofessional.

No matter how hard you work if they feel some type a way they will start to stack points against you. The wrongfuly accused me of stealing time and refused to do a proper investigation like reviewing cameras and taking states from witnesses. I clocked out wrong by mistake. They tried saying I did it on purpose and that there was no record of me even trying to swipe my badge. I did my job I was top picker. The one day I decided to go in for over time on a day I was not scheduled and hours I was not used to inputting I was fired for punching out 2 hours after my actual scheduled time off. Yvonne pulled me to the offer and accused me of stealing time. She was rude and had an attitude. I tried to fight it and 20 minutes later she had already processed the paperwork to fire me effective immediately for gross misconduct. This ruin my life. I had to restart, find a new job. I was forced to claim unemployment because no jobs were paying as much as I was making. I went from 20 an hour to 16 an hour because Yvonne and Verna from Walmart distribion failed to do their job.

Decent job but know your limits,"To be quite honest, working Walmart is a decent job. They pay well compared to retail counterparts and have a numerous amount of benefits for the employees( 401K, $1 a day college program, PTO, Medical and dental plans, etc). Unfortunately you deal with constant stress and abuse either from angry customers or unreasonable managers or both. I've been with the company for 2 years and only saw 1 associate move from hourly to salaried management. I don't really see a lot of opportunity to move up. Many stores go through stages in which you'll have tons of hours one month and then the next you'll have half of those hours, even for some full-time workers. Talking to managers has become difficult as recently the company eliminated at LEAST 1/3 of all management positions. Hopefully it improves overtime but regardless the company seems to expect to meet all prior expectations while eliminating employees. Corporate home office likes to pass down policies that simply won't realistically work in store. They seem to be out of touch with the actual mechanics of individual stores. Just be prepared for regular policy updates and changes that don't make sense. Overall, it's a manageable job. Experience may vary by store but majority of stores are just breeding grounds stress and mental abuse. To make it in the company:Know company as well as state policies and regulations so coworkers and higher ups can't manipulate you.Learn to put yourself first. Putting everyone and the company first will only lead to inevitable burnout. Help as you can but first make sure you're stable always. - more...",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Uniondale, NY",11/4/20,2020,11,4

"Too many calls, less workers","Run. Before Jet and Walmart were separate, everything was wonderful. Inbound Walmart calls became confusing for consumers. Transferring customer’s complaints for simple and extremely irrelevant calls became unnecessary. Walmart has and have had the sour name to want to shop and call in. “Tier 2” employees barely had any power to help customers. Not enough managers OR supervisors to take calls from angry customers. They were always put on a “list” to “call back.” That is not okay. Especially with how big Walmart is. When will things change? When will management listen to the people who’s making them money? Amazon’s customer service and website is so much more refined and professional. They get things done on the first call. If you have dependents, choose if you want to spend an arm and a leg or choose yourself, Need more bodies to take inbound calls, Suggestions are welcome but no one (all management, trainers, corporate) will not lift a single finger to make things better nor easier for the people who make Walmart money, That goes for in-store and call center. Corporate throwing money at their mess up doesn’t necessarily fix the customers problems. Why have suppliers that don’t answer calls nor refund customers their money? Why keep those suppliers?

Horrible place to work if management is bad. Good place to work if management is good.,This can be the easiest job ever or one of the worst. With competent management and decent team members this can be a very easy job. However the opposite is far more likely. Most of the time expect to be cleaning up someone else's mess. Bad employees are not held accountable most of the time. Good employees have zero incentive to stay good so most just turn to minimum requirements after a year or two. Trying to get into management is a lot harder now that they have done away with department manager and other management positions. I watched completely incompetent people put in charge of departments they had no experience in over people who knew the job and had years of experience. The new reorganization that Walmart has switched to may be better in the long run but right now most employees are stuck dealing with the massive amount of personnel loss due to the department manager removal. There is so much to do and so few people to accomplish it. It is soul crushing to come in day in and day out and not make any progress on all the stuff that needs to be done because there isn't enough time or people to get it done. Every day is just trying to slap a bandage on each new problem and having to watch it get worse while you try to get the twenty other problems done as well. Dont expect good pay despite the 11$ an hour pay you will receive because most likely you will be part time and you will get low hours. Full time employees make decent money but if you aren't full time be prepared for less that 33 hours a week (that's the cap for part time).The bonuses are quarterly and can be quite - more...,1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Algood, TN",11/2/20,2020,11,2

Including giving the easier work to the associates they like most while piling on work and all of the hard tasks to set up the associates they didn't like to fail to give them grounds to fire you.. They stress their ""Zero Retaliation Policy"" but the Department Manager I worked under constantly targeted an employee that she didn't enjoy working over and took her daily frustrations out on them until they left the department/were fired.

Expect to pick up after other associates slack,"I have worked for Walmart for over two years now and I have been able to move up in my pay rate. The cashier position wasn't really for me but online order fulfillment and online grocery pickup makes me feel productive. I have noticed laziness in associates my age that also work in OGP so the integrity isn't really strong within the workplace. It doesn't seem like these associates are punished for it. There are times where I feel like I should be paid more for all the slack I pick up as an associate. Regardless, I am appreciative of the bonuses received for working during the pandemic (although hourly pay was not raised to match or overshoot Targets compensation). Overall I recommend Walmart if it's your job and if you like high energy environments. I work with people my age (16-20) which makes it more enjoyable so definitely look into that as well.

Awful experience ,"I worked a small Walmart grocery and I met a lot of nice people who truly became good friends of mine but Management never helped us. I was barely trained, I didn't know how to handle angry customers and I could barely do my own job without messing something up due to not being trained properly. We were completely understaffed, so the workload was heavy and half of my coworkers never wanted to do their own jobs so a lot of the new people, including myself had to do it. I think what pushed me over the edge of quitting after only a month was hearing my managers call everyone in my department useless. so yeah, work for Walmart if you want your soul to be sucked out of your body.",2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Henderson, NV",10/30/20,2020,10,30

To much work and low pay. ,Managers will want you to do all the work while they are just relaxing in the office.

Good Workplace,"I enjoy working at Walmart. I am in the Online Grocery Pickup Department (OGP). It is a fast-paced environment. Always on your feet picking orders on the sales floor or dispensing orders to customer's cars. It's physically demanding sat times. Management is helpful. If you do your job and have a good attitude there won't be any problems. Also, you can completely choose the hours and days you want to work. Just like any other job, staying focused and on task definitely, get you noticed! ",5,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Lewisville, TX",10/29/20,2020,10,29
Retail At Its Largest. ,"A varietal job of customer service, freight experience, and retail sales and all on your feet for eight hours. On a typical day, I clocked in, checked for freight to work and returns to replace on the salesfloor. I was also trained on a cash register, meaning my day would be infrequently interspersed with ringing up customers' groceries. Amidst this, I learned how to sell products, how to find items and place them in their correct location via UPCs, how to talk with customers and fellow associates alike. The culture of the workplace was fine, mostly, though there came a tired feeling when the front end (cash registers) never had enough people, and so would pull from different departments, especially my own and myself, regardless of what projects we had that day. Customers come first after all, and I do not fault that, but it felt like we never had quite enough people on staff even as one of the biggest employers in the state and the country.

Unfortunately, SOPs and best practices are not followed at other locations. While I feel like overall Wal-Mart can be a good place to work for, it really depends on the store. The pharm tech pay is the highest I've seen for retail in my area and even higher than the hospital I work at currently. I feel that this is a good place for new techs, too.

Aside from that, the general feeling of being there made me sick to my stomach as I would often have breakdowns about not having anyone who could help me solve these problems. Supposedly my manager was the person I could go to about these problems I was having, but they were always busy and couldn’t keep track of everyone’s whereabouts or how much work they did all the time.

good job,"good job, good pay, easy money, My pay and benefits at Walmart are pretty competitive compared to other jobs.

Great support management,"Great support management. Assistant managers have go be in ten places at one time.  My store is great. I work with a team of awesome ladies. Customers can be rude and toss clothing on floor and completely destroy any attempt you make to keep your department neat. The customers get angry about co-vid guidelines as if you created the virus on your own.

The co workers are a mixed bag of amazing and ehh,"While working there they took away our ability to use our sick pay for when our dependents got ill and we needed to take off, they made it very difficult to use pay we already accumulated. I was on maternity leave after 2 years of work, and they sent me a dismissal paper claiming I didn't have an approved application for leave after I was already approved. I received it a day after delivering my son, they revoked it after I proved my approval and reinstated everything back to normal. The managers are mixed some are awesome and understanding while another threatened my job when I left work because my husband just had a heart attack. Another manager tried to force me to undermine ethics and morality to save a few cents. Many who work there see their job as only what is in their description and won't work together to make their department shine. While some will work together and do what it takes, I believe this happens because the company treats you like you are easily replaceable.  Working here you will most likely be cross trained and learn alot, the pay is better the longer you stay and that is why some stay. I ultimately left due to unsanitary practices being forced on me and reported it many times....I resigned after the reports went no where, but not before reporting directly to the store manager. I will probably never work for Walmart again unless it's a position to keep practices healthy and safe.",2,Former Employee,"Customer Service Specialist, bakery, cap team member ","Aberdeen, WA",10/27/20,2020,10,27

Quality of job depends on your position and location ,"I worked as a cashier for a bit over a year. Also, did layaway during the holidays. There’s a lot of pressure to be fast.

Great co-workers and job but poor salary,"Management receives excellent pay while those who do the backbreaking work are ignored being paid for their worth. There are some excellent workers who would stay with this company if the pay was equal to the amount of work being performed. The training is sub-par and individual recognition is non-existant. If you work hard you receive the same treatment as someone who is lazy, if you are always on time you are treated the same as those who are always late. If you do your best it is not recognized or reflected in your pay. The turnover rate is ridiculously high due to the unfair pay practices. The more you do the less it affects what you make per hour. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has a great work ethic, it would be a waste of a great work ethic. ",2,Current Employee,Cap 2 Team Associate ,"Sault Sainte Marie, MI",10/27/20,2020,10,27
Worked to the bone and with little to no benefits.,"Wal-Mart lures you in with the hopes of benefits and good pay, but as soon as you join, you find out quickly that this is all lies. For your first three months, they put you as temporary to bypass the need for giving you any kind of benefits - which is illegal. Even after that, the benefits for an hourly associate are minute. Advancement is near-impossible unless you display the qualities of your highschool bully. Pay is way too low for the arduous work they have us do, and worker's compensation is very low.

"It's retail, it started ok, until I got used elsewhere","I started as an afternoon cashier, which was the position I applied for originally. I enjoyed working cashier, and I was decent at my job. One day, the manager decided I would become a cart pusher, and I got swapped to work outside. My work attitude deteriorated, and management didn't honestly care all that much. When things got busy, they would have me assist inside, but when the new manager took over, and I got scorned for what I did on my lunch break (I used to sit in my car, as I generally avoided the break room), and belittled me and my car. After requesting help several times, and receiving the response of ""suck it up, and do it"", I knew it was time to go.

Garbage leadership and work environment. Benefits are sorta-ok.  ,"Worked here 6 1/2 years. Few years back it was great. Once I was promoted into a salaried role, I got a good insight into how the company actually operated. Regional and market level teams are horrible. They will threaten your job in a heartbeat. They expect you to work 80 hours a week and come in on vacation time. No breaks, ever. If you do get a lunch, expect to get phone calls while on it. They would rather run the stores with no staff than lose their bonus. Sure, the pay is alright for most salaried manager roles in retail, but it sure doesn’t account for the lack of respect or the bad work/life balance. Best way to get promoted is to know someone. Don’t believe the open door confidentiality promise, most of the times the people reviewing complaints are the ones you’re complaining on. Retaliation is certainly an issue, at least it was in my market. Benefits are 2 star at best. Dental is pretty good, health insurance isn’t. Vision is good as long as you use it at Walmart. 10% discount card doesn’t even cover tax in most places, and it only applies to certain items during certain times of the year. If I were to give any advice, it wouldn’t be to work here. ",2,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Louisiana,10/26/20,2020,10,26

Don’t stay for too long.,"Work-life balanceWork-life balance at Walmart is, I say focus on leaving Walmart, when it’s time to go leave, don’t cover until the next person clocks in. You’ll probably be left alone for hours and if you work a register you’ll probably be there until you get locked out and forced to go to lunch. Leaving work will be the best feelings and coming back will be dreadful.Pay & benefitsMy pay and benefits at Walmart are based on what you know and what you can do. Benefits are near none at basic levels but higher level managers will take vacations almost every month. While at Walmart you’ll at most at base level get only 5 paid days off. Other than that you have to wait till next year. Bonuses are based on the store manager who may or may not give it out.Job security and advancementIn terms of job security at Walmart, Walmart Will keep you there until you leave or give them enough reason to fire you. Advancement from my personal experience is based on who likes you or who you know. I was told I was gonna keep my new management positions only for someone to take it after I clean the area and fixed up the area after the previous manager of the area left for months and given no equipment but gave the new manager equipment and wanted me to train them. Not only happen to me but also two other coworkers.ManagementIn general, managers at Walmart will toss you anywhere else but your area especially if you’re a guy.

Annoying ,Got hired in to cashier they had 3 people standing at the door handing out mask and greeting customers as well as clean buggies.

Family obligations? Denied instantly. They want you to commit your whole life to Walmart without any bothersome things. No one tells you that they have a point system.

They gossip about associates and and other members of management. A very messy environment! When things are stressful or hard, management runs and leaves you out to dry.

Sometimes we'd be understaffed in other departments so they'd call us over to help but whenever my department was literally only me during a shift they'd turn a blind eye if you were drowning in customers. Moral is they could care less about you until they need you. Pick a department you can't be moved and do your work, depending on the walmart they may have high standards or low standards.

The personnel lady would just hire her friends instead of hiring people based on their skills. She even di the schedule which she definitely made to where they had every weekend off with set schedules. When I started there she told me that it was essential for me to work weekends if I was consider to work there. Oh yeah and ethics is pretty much useless.

Stressful Bakery,"I started working as a baker and cake decorator in the Fall of 2010, and stayed for 4+ years. My starting pay was above average for that time, and the benefits were really nice. I ended up with a pretty decent 401k after a while, which was nice. But working there was a mess. The Bakery was almost always understaffed. I would be the only person working after 3pm most nights until 10pm. I would get called back to write on cakes during my break. If you worked a full 8 HR shift you were supposed to get a 15 min break, then a 30 min - 1 hr lunch and then another 15 min break, but that rarely ever happened. Management had some serious  communication issues. I was even given issues about having off 2 days before a vacation... that was submitted and approved 4+ months prior. I was staying past my schedule shift a lot of nights and cutting my breaks short because work needed to get done and there was no other help there with me. I would also get called over to help in the Deli, and was expected to be able to use the slicer without any experience. I ended up moving farther away and found a better paying job, and when I put my 2 weeks notice in...

Very unorganized ,"Cashiering at Walmart is kinda easy, it’s really the managers and customers that will make you stop wanting to work there. Most managers were really unorganized, would forget to give breaks and then lie or act surprised when you tell them you’ve been due, would give you registers without money, they train poorly and they even have people that have been only working there for weeks training new people and then prematurely put the on a register by themselves so you constantly have to help them when it’s busy. They’re always firing people so they put the pressure on the little cashiers they’ve been left with to the point managers themselves have to get on or they have to get someone from a totally different department. I could really go on. Ok now to the customers.. they’re rude and entitled, will literally throw their money at you, and will look for any excuse to talk to a manager, the most ridiculous complaint I’ve got is that I “wasn’t friendly enough and didn’t smile”.. ma’am I’m wearing a mask. But yes the customers are really rude and the only good thing about the managers is that they know they’re ridiculous so they don’t put complaints against unless it’s extreme.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Cleveland, OH",10/24/20,2020,10,24

First time working there, nobody was willing to give training and I was yelled at for things that they have never trained. I had to get the information needed online to survive. The manager is blind or don’t care to what is going on around him. The hours given is based on what you or your family needs, not based on the performance. The manager is covering up the mistakes of the person that he likes, and blames it on someone else. He said one thing but did the opposite. I liked the company, the job and the patients, but the direct supervisor I worked with made those not important anymore. ",2,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,Texas,10/24/20,2020,10,24

We were required to help customers find things but when they are constantly coming up to you and taking up your time you could get yelled at for not completing your task on time. I enjoyed helping some of the customers and learning about whatever they were doing. I worked a steady 40 hours, at the time I was there the daily schedule varied. I could work 8-5 one day and 12-8 the next, but right after I left they implemented a 3 shift system; 5-2, 2-11 and and overnight stocking shift.

"Good coworkers, poor management and a very metrics centric environment","I worked in the Online Grocery Pickup department of Walmart for 6 months as a Dispenser. It is an easy enough job, with pretty repetitive and simple tasks once you learn the process. I was not trained very long and had to figure out a majority of things myself, but this did not really make the job more difficult, as it it pretty simple. Asking for help when I needed it instead of winging it went a long way. I would always wear a mask, and hand sanitizer, raincoats, spare masks, and other types of equipment were available if necessary. Job security was fine as long as you stayed in line and did your job as expected. Nothing more and nothing less meant you were okay. There is a constant influx of new people and the amount of experienced people dwindled, which I will get into later. On the occasion you'll have to use physical strength, but nothing you would be lifting would range above 50-60lbs at one time. Mainly, awkwardly-sized objects would cause difficult lifts, but aside from this, it is not very physically strenuous. You will always be on your feet if you are not on break. Interaction with customers is simple and easy, and every customer service situation was solvable or manageable if you put your head to it. Interfacing with the electronic equipment is easy enough, though the equipment was a bit dated and finnicky. Sometimes it showed its age, and even as an extremely technically literate person it could make the job more difficult on the occasion. Now for some really tough stuff.

I mean one day I got in trouble for not having a box in my hand ? like really lol. This company has taught me so much about working in a place thats so unorganized not managed right. It gets so bad that some departments dont even get touched or done for that working day. Not because of the workers because the management is so unproductive. They know we need more people for the whole store and for cap 2 team alone yet no one gets hired and the ones that do dont go to cap 2 team there put in like apparel or something. The hardest part of the job is when you work so hard your best and still a manger tell you your unproductive and you dont do anything,,, your not appreciated at Walmart your abused and taken advantage of.

Don't ,"Seriously, just don't. It pays well enough ( there is better out there ), but Wal-Mart's strategy to boost production is to consistently hang your job over your head. It's not bad passing through, but don't make any longterm goals with this company. At the end of 3 years there, the only difference between me and a 20 year associate was the fact that they accrued their PTO a little faster.

Only temporary,"It is a really good job if you’re looking for something that’s purely temporary.

Good workplace overall but they expect you to do more than your pay grade,Supervisors and co workers were a pleasure to work with however upper management such as department managers and store managers made the job dreadful with rudeness and unreasonable tasks for employees to complete not to mention that they guilt trip you and make it difficult when you need a day or 2 off. ,3,Former Employee,Fresh Department Customer Availability Clerk II ,"3615 Marietta Hwy, Dallas, GA 30157",10/21/20,2020,10,21
Fast paced and average people,"Walmart is a pretty average place to work at in my opinion. Some would consider the personal shopper to be a physically demanding job, but I personally like it becuase I find it to be healthy. With rude customers it can be mentally draining and a little stressful to do your best. Overall the managers are fine people, they come in and do their work. There is some unprofessional cussing, and people don't wear masks and I personally find that annoying. But overall I go there to make money, and that job helps me do it and no one's really mean, just some are annoying so its a pretty decent place and I like it so far.",4,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,New York State,10/21/20,2020,10,21
Not the greatest of places but one of the few higher paying.,"It's definitely not my first choice for a job but the pay is better than minimum wage atleast. The managers definitely expect alot from you, more than your pay grade for sure.

Was great until the restructure,Walmart just restructured all management positions. Restructure was based solely on upper management. No one could apply or request positions and those of us who didn't make the cut are being treated like garbage. We are not allowed to apply for other positions or step down. Either we take what they offered us or leave the company. I went from a day shift position 10 miles from my home to an overnight position an hour away where I am talked down to and treated like a stocker rather than a member of management. Will be leaving as soon as I find another job. ,3,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Pennsylvania,10/21/20,2020,10,21
Don't work there,Walmart is the worst company I ever worked for they are nothing to do with their employees they don't care about their employees only thing they care about is money they know they can get other people to work for lesser money and that's what they'll do they promote you and then when the kobuk came in they laid me off and wanted me to come back for less money it's the worst company in the world as far as I'm concerned and I'll tell everybody out there if you go to work for Walmart your crazy,1,Former Employee,Technician ,"Greenwood, IN",10/21/20,2020,10,21

It's a job,"My job itself wasn't bad. I was very good at what I did. My department manager was always good to me, she gave me time off for family things so long as I requested it in an appropriate amount of time, she made sure my schedule was fairly consistent so I knew when I needed a sitter and could plan things out. Pay at the time was okay, it took care of my bills. most of my co-workers and immediate supervisors were great.They do have some policies that don't make any sense at all. And while my department manager and immediate supervisors were good to me, some of the managers in-between were absolutely awful. One even put me in tears. The management staff at this location are VERY clique-y and moving up is virtually impossible. You only get promoted if they like you or they have no choice. Overall it's a job and it pays the bills but it's not something you wake up looking forward to.

Stressful with no support ,"Not enough equipment for staff. Not enough staff to complete job duties, but company keeps increasing the daily caps on orders. I work as a personal shopper and we are picking over 310 orders a day. We are a super center with a very high volume of customers. This means the store is very busy but you are still rated on how many items you can pick in one hour. Trying to get down an aisle is sometimes an impossibility but we are needing to hustle, other customers be damned. The people who work the hardest are expected to do more while the lazy people goof off and aren’t expected to do much. I have found that to be true at most places, but it is especially flagrant here. Don’t expect any help from any managers. Job culture is a joke and a disappointment. The only good thing about this job WAS the pay but I have been here for 2 1/2 years now and the new hires are making more than people with seniority. The starting wage for them is more than we are getting paid. So not fair. If you need a job, they will hire you, but I sadly cannot recommend Walmart for long term employment.

Fun work place and met many people , There was many times that you were left at your own pace. It showed you how to prioritize your time. The only bad thing from my experience was when I became a department manager I wasn’t given the proper training to come learn everything of my department I was basically left to sink  or swim type of thing.Overall I really did love my experience working  with the people there I have learned a lot about myself and how to work.,5,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Worthington, MN",10/20/20,2020,10,20
Don't do it unless you are desperate,"Management is absolutely awful, they treat you like they know how to do your job better than you and that you are bad at it but won't come help when the area is drowning. They just look at you funny when you say you need help, then say they will send someone, and no one ever comes. I've literally ran the entire deli and bakery alone with no help from them. Then they come in and tell me this that and the other is wrong, but won't listen when you explain that that's how it actually works in the real world behind the counter. Pay is garbage, and they have secret techniques of keeping you from getting a bonus or raise. The work is high paced and high stress, which isn't a problem if you don't mind actually working. So many of the associates they bring in don't want to do a thing but stand around and get paid. Alot of the associates are great though, a joy to work with. But not worth all the relentless bull management throws your way. And i mean an unreasonable amount daily, I'm not just complaining about working hard.

Nice place to work if you don’t have bills to pay,I wouldn’t recommend working at Walmart to anyone unless you have very minimal bills to pay. They pay you very little and they don’t give you any hours. It’s also almost impossible to get on there full time seeing as how stingy the company itself is in regards to benefits and pay. Along with the terrible pay and almost nonexistent hours the things you have to tolerate on the job are just not worth it in my opinion. Overall the company just views you as a replaceable number and they treat you as such. Other than the afore mentioned the people there are wonderful. Moreover I still would not recommend ,2,Former Employee,Stocker/Receiver ,"Spencer, WV",10/20/20,2020,10,20
General and District manager were terrible,"First the good, pay was great and my co-workers were all fantastic people to work with but the general manager didn't care about automotive at all and would often get upset that we weren't meeting goals but refused to give us the manpower necessary. Every department was given a set amount of hours to use and automotive always got screwed dispite being one of the most profitable departments. Often techs were pulled to go help in other departments regardless of how busy it was. We got many compliments because they would take our only sales associate and techs were typically busy in the shop and had a difficult time managing both the shop and the sales counter. Rarely anyone in automotive got a raise outside the company wide raises. There were several people there that had been working 10+ years without any sort of raise. Walmart is a pretty good company to work for but not this one as the general manager did not do a good job. I hope they are able to find a suitable replacement because it could be a fantastic place to work especially if you're going to school",2,Former Employee,Lube and Tire Technician ,"Springville, UT",10/20/20,2020,10,20

It was a very fun but sometimes challenging ,The job of being an unloaded can be fun but also challenging. You have little time to be able to put up the freight. And sometimes management doesn’t understand that you have to help customers and that it will take longer to finish. Then also being a supervisor of cap 2 was very vert challenging. The reason it was challenging was because of management. Sometimes they would want me to do jobs that didn’t even pertain to my duty’s. But other than that.

Good pay but not trustworthy & incredibly greedy corrupt & poorly operated.,They pay well & you can meet a great amount of individuals there. But theyre one of the largest retail companys in the world so they take advantage & dont abide by rules. They have horrible holidays are unfair & inconsiderate towards employees families & personal loves. Theyre also very unforgiving & do not hold back to scold or remind you of failures & mistakes. Example calling in on holidays gives you a bad rep when they only give 1 day off out of the year. Theyre also very corrupt & greedy they have so many stores being mismanaged w/ unethical & immoral treatment of employees in the workplace. They lie scold get after you & make you pay for getting on their bad side.They're two faced & very shady & are quick to cover their own ends but are quick to remind you of their failures.

I also shop there and have seen firsthand that my own manager is lax with that shift but micromanages and pushes my team to overwork ourselves to pick up everyone else’s slack. The complaints from my coworkers are almost all the same, we are worked like slaves and told to do more, pull more weight harder and faster, lift heavier and ultimately work harder but only get paid $11.

It Depends on the Store,"With Walmart, it all comes down to the store you’re in. For four years, I worked at a store where company policy was the standard above all else. It was great. We were encouraged to learn the ins and outs of the company, and to use them in favor of the customer. The manager there would say “a customer at a time, a day at a time, a store at a time.” It was a very customer-centric experience and if you did the right thing, you advanced.  Then I moved to a store where the standard was getting in good with the co-manager, and I don’t do office politics. I hung on for 2 years but the difference was way too much to handle.

What stands out about working at this company?,"Our job was to provide a place for children to come during the day while their parents tried to find housing, etc. Their time included all of the things children in regular school enjoyed plus breakfast and lunch.

"Pretty awful, but has some perks.","Walmart tends to work well with your schedule for the most part. As a student I can lay out my availability according to my class schedule and they will typically stick to it. However, the attendance policy leaves much to be desired. You are allowed 4.5 points/ call ins before you are fired and they drop off 6 months after the date. However there are things that come up more than just 8 times a year, not to mention getting sick. On top of that, you get a my share bonus, which depends on the amount of points you have, so you are punished for being sick or other priorities yet again. You can accumulate Paid time off, but this is hard to do as a part time associate, as it is based off of the number of hours you work. Management is awful, my direct manager is nice and does a fantastic job, but she is constantly under stress and having to stay late, because upper management is always yelling at her. Those of us who can actually do our jobs correctly are always having to pick up the slack of those who do not, yet receive no recognition for our job well done. Somehow Walmart has found a way to make a grocery store political. If you aren’t one of the “cool” kids you’re going to get treated differently than others. You can advance quickly through Walmart, but caution advancement is practically signing over your life and soul to Walmart. Overall, if you’re someone who likes to do your job and do it well, I caution you in accepting a job at Walmart unless you want it as a career, because they will take your work ethic and run you into the ground.",2,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Ames, IA",10/18/20,2020,10,18
Dead Company,I left because a Store Manager was rude and condescending and was making my life a living h3ll. I was working 25/7 and since Salaried you don't get overtime. As well if you report any issues the Market Manager dismisses you. If you want to move up in the company you can't have a life. I know several people personally and they ended in divorce bc the company wants you to be on call 24/7. It literally sucks your soul. If you want to do cashier watch out for the drama. It's clicky and catty. If the supervisor doesn't like you they'll influence the manager to get rid of you. The company is slowly going down hill trying to work a 8 billion store with only 9 people on floor all day and 5 cashiers all day.

Steady Work But Bad Environment ,"I’ve worked for Walmart going on a year and a half now, and this is my second time around being employed with the company. In my own personal experience in my second store there was poor management. I also worked full time hours for 5 months plus and they made it extremely hard to reap my full time employee benefits. Associates are often poorly managed due to such a high volume of works and low volume of managers. It’s good for a steady paycheck but hardly any room for growth. It’s rare that your hard work is noticed or appreciated.

You have to request absent days 3 weeks in advance in order for it to be approved or denied which is kinda dumb because things can happen last minute. When you call and say you can’t make it, walmart keeps a point system so you get i think like 2 points for calling in i’m not sure but when you have enough points in one rolling period, you can get terminated. Also the managers disappear all the time and i have trouble locating them when i have an issue with the customer.

Personnel woman acts like she owns the store, lies about helping you when you first start, or anytime. when you ask her something she has ""no access or control"" because she doesn't want to do it.Front end seriously can't get it together, their always lost, and very lazy. They just stand up there all day and complain and cry all day because they have to stand there. Half the front end employees think they run it and their not friendly up front either. Area i worked in was always overlooked, we was always sent to other areas to help out and ours was not cared for, they never sent anyone over to help us. Honestly in my personal opinion This is a very awful place too work for. Only have a few good things about Walmart. Pay is decent. People I worked with are good had plenty of laughs to make day go by faster. They help with going back to school but negative side not much programs to choose from.

terrible location.,"walmart as a corporation isn't bad in how they treat employees. could be better, but whatever. this location treats their employees SO BADLY. management follows us around in store on our days off, management regularly comes in to secretly watch us when they're not working to report on us. management regularly makes up lies about associates and allow their favorites to stay on their phones, leave the store for hours at a time, and generally break all rules. however, if you are not a favorite of upper management, if you step a toe out of line of perfection you are instantly threatened and reprimanded. nobody does their job here because it is so easy to get away with this behavior unless you are not loved by upper management.

Fast paced work environment,"I have worked at Walmart Pharmacy for over 20 years. As a technician, I have been given the opportunity to advance to a lead role. I enjoy working with my team and the pharmacy systems are efficient. We used to have very supportive upper management in the pharmacy, but that is a thing of the past. The saturation of pharmacists has created a stressful work environment for those hoping to keep their jobs. With the recent drop in business due to COVID, we are all keenly aware that our work hours will most likely be cut and positions elimininated. The market manager is never available for store based support and the focus on opioid stewardship is unrealistic and obsessive to the point that patient care is affected.The relationship between the pharmacy and front store is lacking. There is no support and respect for what is done in the pharmacy. The company has made it a goal to reduce or eliminate their longterm associates' positions by restructuring or eliminating specific roles, thereby forcing longterm associates to take positions in lower paid areas. The health insurance benefits get worse each year.

Worst place I’ve worked at!!!,"When I worked there they had this thing called seniority, it basically holds your job in place for if the new employees have an issue you get a say in if they stay or leave and other decisions that shouldn’t be of their choice or say. The co store manager i had worked for was very rude, I had an issue and wanted to move departments, so I did the steps as much as possible cause our  assistant manager quit without telling anyone, so the next step would be him, he didn’t move me at all never gave me updates or anything. I then had another issue in the department, where an employee was screaming at me in front of customers, and the co store manager found out and took her side immediately without knowing the situation, he was asking questions but talking over me everytime I would respond. The guy was r a c i s t and h o m o p h o b I c and very unprofessional they pretty much all are besides a few and only 1 of them were managers but not of my department. I also tried to talk to both HR and The head store manager and they wouldn’t answer the phone, I tried to do everything I could but they wouldn’t listen. So be aware the communication isnt what you expect and the employees and managers aren’t held to a open minded standard at all!Not all Walmart’s are like this.

Relaxing and easy ,Working at Walmart as a stocker is very easy. You work by yourself most of the time and management makes rounds every couple of hours to check on you. It is a big store so you’re pretty much assigned to a task and expected to do your own thing. You don’t have to interact with customers much unless they ask for assistance locating something.

They’ve messed up me and multiple others pay checks and mine is still not fixed so I never received a lot of money that I earned. 0/10 would never recommend anyone to work here the pay isn’t even good enough for the things you have to deal with daily.

And knowing full well about the call outs they would fire the ones that had the least call outs and continue on using the ones that always call out in the department, and it was wrong.

It's all about the money with the company.,The managers just don't communicate with their associates. It's has become all about the profit kind of company even though they make billions.

I don't recommend the company unless you are aiming for a management position but watch your back if you have pre-existing conditions affecting you they may just cut your hours.

Very Studious,"Walmart is a great place to work especially if you are just out. The starting pay is good however you are not compensated enough for the work that you do. Even though Cashiers do a lot of work, we get paid less than other people who work there. Some of the Managers or Supervisors are mean and do not care about your development. I have been there for more than two years and still getting paid only 11 dollars and some change while new cashier roles that are being advertised are supposedly going to be paid $12; ",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,New Jersey,10/11/20,2020,10,11
Pretty good place to work.,It’s basically the luck of the draw I have worked in great stores and I have worked in bad stores. The stores in the rural areas are normally a better experience.

Be Ready to be Busy,"The Walmart I worked for was a very fast paced, large store. Unless you work in a specialized area (Auto, Eye, etc) you can pretty much work any where in the store. I originally applied to be an Electronics Associate, but I also worked in Fabrics+Crafts, Stationary, and Front End Cashier. If you can't be on your feet for long periods of time this is not the job for you. There may also be times where managers will ask you to assist with unloading freight from the trucks or putting stock on the floor where ever they are short of staff. I;m not sure if this is all stores, but it is pretty easy to catch onto. Some people stay at Walmart 30+ years and move up the work chain, others stay three months to help for the holidays - either way you go will work out.

Eh,"When I first started working at Walmart, I enjoyed it a lot. There was much to learn, and it was very interesting. Since March 2019, when I was hired, things have went downhill. The management is terrible. I never would have thought manages were this bad. Work load is totally unbalanced, and for the pay it is not worth it. From working in an overheated backroom for sometimes 6 hours at a time, occasionally my whole shift, the pay is just not worth it. There is also a lot of backstabbing in the company and to move up, you must be handpicked or a favorite to a higher up. I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody. And did I mention favoritism? ",3,Current Employee,Cap team 2 ,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",10/11/20,2020,10,11
Strenuous job for the time given,"Okay job for decent pay. Learned a lot, especially how the dynamic is there. Lots of conflicting orders which results in you getting in trouble or gossiped about. Hours were all over the place initially but due to working in garden/seasonal they would give you a steady schedule during holidays (although an impossible workload). I also got pulled into other departments an unfair amount even though I was usually the only one in my department at the times they'd need help, which screwed me either way because I'd get in trouble with one manager or the other. But hey it was a paycheck and an experience I guess.",3,Former Employee,Garden/Seasonal ,"Bernalillo, NM",10/11/20,2020,10,11
"Fun to work at times, but Very stressful environment as well.","When I was hired in 2012 at my first store, it started out good, as time went on & you meet other workers,  hear conversations & see things that take place you begin to wonder if you have made a wrong decision.  I learned that each store is different because of the management team. I had a few decent bosses because I transferred several times, so I experienced alot. It took several years for me to gain full-time status ! A very good learning experience for me ! It's 2020 now, I hear they are offering & doing more for the workers, but I think it's only due to the Covid virus. DO NOT WORK FOR WALMART IF YOU ARE A WEAK PERSON! YOU WON'T SURVIVE!

"Easy Job, but comes with cons","I worked at Walmart for a little over a year in electronics, and it’s, for the most part, a pretty easy and cool job. my co-workers were really cool for the most part, and i have some i consider close associates. But, of course, there are cons. Management is sloppy, unorganized, and you never know what type of day you’ll get. some are a breeze, and some can be annoying, stressful, and tiresome due to the amount of kids (Walmart hires a lot of first times, including me) calling off, and leaving a lot of work on your plate. but overall, a good first job.

Bad location,I worked at Walmart Howell Mill. It was bad from the beginning. No proper training so I really couldn’t help the already rude customers.

Most employees had bad attitudes and hated the workplace. I had to get out of the environment. I worked here three weeks.,1,Former Employee,SCO Host ,"Atlanta, GA",10/10/20,2020,10,10
My 2 years at Walmart,People make the choice to either work or not work.

The insurance isn't the best as in you can catch the flu, but don't get diagnose with anything major or need any surgeries, they don't cover the vast majority of it. The management team doesn't put in the effort like the regular associates do. They stand around chit chatting their entire shift. They keep departments short staffed on purpose to cut pay ties. However, if you can keep up with working quickly and under pressure you'll be fine here. The pay is decent and you do get yearly evaluations that increase the amount you receive.
