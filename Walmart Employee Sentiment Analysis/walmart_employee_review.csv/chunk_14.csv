Lack of management/communication,Literally anyone can advance their career with Walmart. That being said it doesn’t set up the employees around them with the best role models to look up to. Management does NOT care about their employee complaints/concerns or questions. There is no communication between associates or management. Constant change in directions from multiple managers daily.,3,Current Employee,Fresh Cap 2 Associate ,"Chattanooga, TN",8/13/19,2019,8,13

If you have a positive attitude you will enjoy working here.,"I enjoyed my overnight maintenance position. Until it was time to change my availability to days. I never missed any time from work so management had no problem granting my request.  Of course I had to apply through the proper procedure to make that change. Once on the day shift  I continued to clean the restrooms (sweeping, mopping, wiping down all surfaces, restocking all, and sanitizing and cleaning all surfaces in the employee lunch rooms. making sure the front entrances were free of debris and all trash was emptied. I liked the family friendly employee culture. The hardest part of the job was knowing when to stop and clock out. I enjoyed taking care of my store and making it grand opening ready every day. I think the stock is a win.  Everybody has to have groceries and grocery related items.",5,Former Employee,Overnight Maintenance Associate ,"Hampton, VA",8/13/19,2019,8,13

Production needs more people than they're hiring,Production is by far the most stressful part of the store because of a lack of workers for example sometimes I was in production by myself for a few hours and I worked mid day. I was told there would always be 2 or 3 other people working with me. Management still has the same requirements for 1 person working there as 3 or 4 people working there,3,Former Employee,Associate ,"Cedar Hills, UT",8/13/19,2019,8,13

It was okay.,It’s pretty active and fast paced when it was busy which was a lot of times but the hours varied and sometimes catch you by surprise with a week for just 15 hours and some times they will throw 35-40 hours. I just don’t think it’s stable enough to support a family and pay bills and if your part time you don’t receive benefits until you have been there for a year or longer. Full time only applies to management or over night stockers. It’s okay to work there but you will probably need a second job because many people there have two or three jobs. They cut hours a lot and yet still keep hiring more people.,3,Former Employee,Apparel/Jewelry Associate ,"Tampa, FL",8/13/19,2019,8,13
Managers do not groom employees to care,They need to teach their managers to appreciate the employees even if it’s just saying good job or say something positive all they do is find something wrong instead of finding something right,3,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Leland, NC",8/13/19,2019,8,13

"poor management, lack of advancement, no raises or bonuses",Management will write you up for tasks they were responsible for. Work policies aren't clearly disclosed. After your year probation you have to wait  a few months to receive your first raise. No holiday pay and no overtime. Quarterly raises were scarce and only worth $5 when given.

Very fast paced.  Job opportunities are endless.,"Very fast paced.  You must be able to multitask and not take things personal. The stress level can be very high at times because of the workload they want done on a daily basis.  Management needs to take more time and listen to their associates when they need them.

Average,"The management team at my specific location is willing to help you with any questions or concerns you may have. There are some management members who do not care. This is not the type of environment I am used to working in. I love my job and what I do, although aside from management, other employees are less focused on their job and more focused on drama or being lazy on the job.

They completely took the coworkers side because he had been with the company longer. After that incident happened, Management worked with employees (out of their way) to get me written up for things that never happened. _x000D_I then reported the incident several times to Corporate, had several phone calls with them, just to receive a random email one day about my case being closed. They did absolutely NOTHING, so I had to quit. I could no longer work in such a hostile environment.

new managment,"Overall Walmart does have many items to choose from. Unfortunately, many times they are out of specific brand names. It makes me wonder if they might be pushing their store brand. The employees are quite helpful and polite at my local store. I shop here at least weekly and can usually find exactly what I want. But I have noticed that Walmart quality and services seems to change from location to location. An example is the Walmart at Monroeville, Alabama location seems to have lesser quality clothing and less varieties of food. An example is trying to find a fresh corned beef. Virtually impossible!

Not enough help,"The best part of the job were the co-workers._x000D_ The hardest part of the job was not enough associates to cover most departments so being pulled to other departments to cover.

Sucks,I once heard management tell a college student that he could not work in the mornings and if he changes his availablity he will be getting 4 hours a week.

Walmart pays you more than minimum wage and then (attempts) forces you to work holidays and no holiday pay.

Waste of my time and patience.,"I turned down a higher paying job because I had gotten this job and was promised that I would get 30 hours a week up to 40 hours a week. Within 4 weeks of being hired, my hours dropped to 12-18 hours a week while everyone else in my department was working 30+. I never got a locker because there werent enough lockers for the associates and was told not to carry my phone with me on the floor but had no where to lock it up. The manager was breathing down our necks about customer wait times (for Online Grocery Pickup) but refused to get the door fix which would've decreased wait time because we kept getting locked out due to a malfunctioning dispense door. Just like some places, half the other employees are lazy and want someone else to do all the work so generally you have to pick up everyone else's slack. I had gotten irritated because the managers at my store didnt know how to just let people work and constantly walk behind associates to make sure they are working. I didnt like the fact that I was one of the few actually working and they acted like I wasn't and constantly rode my backside about everything. Literally walking by me every 15 minutes asking what I was doing. Managers need further training to identify ""problem"" employees and let working employees do their job. Another thing that was irritating is the managers take people from other departments and make them work in other departments even if they haven't finished the job they were doing yet. For example, I worked as a personal shopper and managers constantly came to our department and took our employees to go stock - more...",1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Spartanburg, SC",8/11/19,2019,8,11

I don't even get to do the parts of the job I was hired to do most of the time, as we are so short staffed I'm asked to help in any random direction that is needed.

When I would get to my area my pallets would already be there and I would down size them and then start with the most I had on one category stock that and then work my way down till I was done.

It had it's moments,"Management was over-worked and under paid. We were constantly picking up where after everyone. The store I was at was in some ways unique in that at some point it became a ""not my job, not my problem"" store. Other places I've worked people looked out for one another and helped each other. This store, if there was something as simple as a piece of cardboard on the floor anywhere, they would walk by it if they didn't let it fall there. I've never seen so much of this attitude anywhere. Also, associates taking their 15 min breaks...Any other place I've worked, yes, people took their breaks, but they only took them if they felt the need to.

"Stressful all the time with NO support from MAPM, MHRM","Walmart stresses that there is no need for Walmart to be a Union, because they have the ""Open Door"" process, If you are not satisfied with a write up or the way you are treated, you can do an ""open door"" and bring the matter up to the level higher. This sounds great, but practical use of it, does not work. There is ONE Market Human Resource Manager for all of Utah County. She is a great lady but she does not have time to look into anything. Therefore, nothing will be fixed or looked into. I was written up once and I did an open door because of retaliation and the Market Human Resource Manager took 3 plus months to get back to me with her results. She wasn't even going to get back to me if I wouldn't have ran into her in a different store. She told me that there is nothing she can do. This is an obvious response that she forgot to look into the situation because if ANYONE else heard these details they would be concerned and would look into it seriously.

"Management always pushing for results, never investigates why goals aren't reached.","The Management team typically makes all their decisions using limited information and rash judgments. They never investigate why things don't get done, or why goals don't get accomplished, they just assume people are lazy or they're not working hard enough. Half of the management team is lazy and stands around and talks most of the time, and later has the nerve to scold their associates for talking while working like they're in middle school. Salaried Management never leads by example._x000D__x000D_Starting pay is fair, but don't expect a raise of more than 30 cents a year. _x000D_Most associates don't get trained more than two or three days, and often times feedback is never given.

Fast paced.,"I work in the deli.  It can get quit busy with snotty, irrational, arrogant, self serving, argumentative people that think the world owes them something.  These same people believe that the store is open 24/7 that the deli is open 24/7.  Occasionally we get in some regular customers that are kind and patient.  It is a lot of cleaning ALL the time.  And when you work with people that prefer to stand around instead of cleaning up their mess it can get very frustrating.  Management, well, that is all that is need to be said.  Corporate management sometimes make decisions that have the worst outcome, like we didn't see that coming.  I still work there part time.  I do like my job but there are things that have changed over the last year that are not for the best.  Lost a lot of my co-workers to stupid corporate policy changes either by being fired or they just had enough and left.  It is like working for someone that has a mental disability and can't settle down long enough to see if it works.

A steady job,"I don't really think there's much of note to mention about the job.  You show up, do your job, and leave when your shift is over.  Sometimes management likes to ask people to come in early or stay late, but their strict policy about ""no overtime"" means they expect you to clock out early, or come in late, on subsequent days in order to avoid getting any overtime.

The execution of the mission is not so great. There were plenty of departs that was understaffed. This leads to those that do work being overworked and I'm not referring to extra hours. The smallest department should have at least 3 peopled staffed to run efficiently but often you will see only one associate staffed. This lowers the money Wal-Mart pays it's employees and allowing them to maintain lower prices for the consumer. The side of the transactions person falls on determines if this a good company or a ""meh"" company. My time here was not all bad.

To further the issue, several of these people had no idea how to even do the jobs being delegated, and as such could not train those that the jobs were delegated to. All in all, it was as sloppy a job as could be expected from the worst of the stereotypes circulating the web._x000D__x000D_On the other end, though, I was loaned out to several other locations during my time with my store. This was partially because of my innate ability to butt heads with my immediate manager, and win when management above the store level got involved.

"Good place, tough job","Management didn't communicate enough with associates. I had a great time, loved my bosses, and had fun moving up the chain. But sadly after working there for a bit you realize management didn't always keep up. we had so many co managers come and go due to that fact. One would put someone in housing, then the other co manager would walk over and send you to help with consumables. Then close to the end of the night, they would realize they now had an empty area and no freight thrown. so they would send me in the last hour to knock out what i could. it was always a rush to finish and clean up. And always had to have people stay extra time to zone. But would then tell them to cut the extra hours they earned at the end of the week by taking 3 hour lunches and such. Great place to work if you want OT and are good with people. But poor managing of areas, and not allowing people to keep the money the earned is a big downfall.

It was okay,"I completed transactions for customers at the register and at the customer service desk. I improved in my customer service skills and interactions with fellow staff members.

Walmart,I enjoyed working for walmart along time ago. It was a nice to work at because the company is unlike any other. If u had to work on holidays the company tried to do little dinners at work to show how much they appreciate us workers. Managers would dress up from time to time to show alittle fun. They did their best to show their appreciation unlike other companies. Out of all the companies if I had to choose to go back to it would be walmart.

Stressful and Negative.,"Working at Wal-Mart is good for work during college but there is very little career advancement there. They can be flexible but you have to be on top of them if they try to change your schedule without telling you. Favoritism runs high there, you can be in a position for years and get no career advancement. But some employees will get great advancements and opportunities simply because a manager likes them.  _x000D__x000D_There is no appreciation for hard work and if you try to give them 100% they will not be grateful.

Has potential to be fun and productive but very boring if not busy,"I learned almost every position there besides management and csm. I usually was doing everything but the position I was hired for most of the time,but that was a good thing because I learned a lot. Also managers took a liking to me and I became someone reliable to get things done which opened up more opportunities for myself. Though most of the time they had scheduling problems where there wasn't enough coverage in the store which put a heavy burden on one or two associates to handle multiple departments at a time. This was the hardest part of this job and it caused havoc with customers, staff, and management. The best part of this job is your relationships you form with other associates.",4,Former Employee,Personal Shopper/Cashier ,"Upland, CA",8/6/19,2019,8,6
Productive and fun place to work at,While working with Walmart for three year's as a cap two associate I really felt like I was apart of a big family. I met a lot of great people with different culture backgrounds and customers who would stop and talk to me. On a typical work day at Walmart as a cap two associate was very difficult at times especially when there was two trucks to unload and get freight stock on time. Management was very flexible with my scheduled while I was attending college and was willing to give great advise to help me push towards my goals.

Then I found every single department I asked to help me was telling my salary managers false negative reviews of my job performance because the department managers were afraid that I was going to take their job. I had a salary manager tell me that when I was ""acting department manager"" for a week that handled it really well for how much my department trash talked me. There was loads of jealous and competitive because I learn really fast and could handle a department manager's job with breeze. There job really not hard.

I work in dc warehouse.. Allot different they'll actual store,I worked in warehouse freezer. Runing high lift forklift restocking. Environment was horrible management at that time was worse. Crazy goals limited training. Always writing u up.  I would have never left this job if the management was different. I asked for more help/training to help meat my % goals. Was told yes I could get more help but still revived write ups for not meeting goals. My opinion nobody should be required spending entire day working in below zero temps. People should be rotated in and outs of these areas. Crazy unrealistic shipping orders hit... No ways of splitting it up... So your day was long. 430 am till whenever... Several days I didn't leave till after 9pm.. Horrible days for sure. The company puts so much stress and pressure on management in turn they put on employees.

So my manager didn't schedule me until I took the exam, passed on my first try and didn't schedule me. I repeatedly asked her to put me down and to give me a weekend off three weeks in advance for college. She refused to do either. I had to turn in my two weeks for if I missed this weekend I would have spent thousands of dollars for nothing. Also in the three month probation period of new hires, no show means fired.

Great hourly job for the pay and hours.,"The work is fine, the leadership has much to be desired. I understand always trying to better, that's the whole point of being a business, but at a certain point you have to stop trying to blame the associates and lower management for things out of their control. Example: I was asked why we always seem to bad on a certain day of the week, and before I could respond I was told, ""but don't tell me the answer is the answer.""

Productive Place,Typical day at work is fast paced and keeps you busy. I learned how to tell if produce is bad and how to further accommodate customers. Most of the management are decent people and treat their employees fairly. The culture of the workplace is easy going and teamwork oriented. The hardest part of the job is meeting their ridiculous times. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with fellow employees and customers.,4,Former Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Springfield, OH",8/4/19,2019,8,4

Great if you're in your 20's and dropped out of school,"Walmart offers a great opportunity to people willing to work 60-70 hours a week. As an assistant manager there is peer pressure to work through lunches and 10 hour days are the minimum-most Asms work longer and the expectation is more that of a 60-70 hour week. If you care about your actual life outside of work you are shut out of the clique. If you have a family emergency or health emergency don't expect anything except passive aggressive guilt tactics if you need to call out. While the training is excellent, and the company's directive sounds good in theory, it isn't followed in person. I love working with people and training associates but the company has a motto, ""coach them out."" At least at the store I'm working at,they seem more concerned about getting rid of people than training them to excel. I've worked in other retail environments and I've never seen such a lack of empathy or professionalism towards others._x000D_While this company offers great benefits[ Free GED, dollar a day online college, 6% 401K match after a year, etc] the pressure is unrelenting, and what I was told when I was hired vs the reality are night and day. I  was given the impression that we had a 45 hr work week with occasion periods where it could go up to 60 hours and that there was a 4 week rotating schedule for management, and an every day process that kept the company running smoothly-  reasons major reasons I accepted the position-the reality is much different.

"Overall, a good starting place","While working there I met a lot of good people who were amazing to work with. Management has always been disconnected to the specific area I worked in. In the end I was given the opportunity to advance, but was told I would stay at the starting cashiering wage while entering management.

Treated us all badly and they favored the ones who licked their boots!",1,Former Employee,Remodel Associate ,"Poplar Bluff, MO",8/4/19,2019,8,4
Almost not worth it.,Management likes to make plans they don't keep. They don't communicate with each other or employees. They treat you like badly and use you without promoting you. They are more likely to hire someone new and promote them than to recognize who is already there. Working there actually set me back due to a lack of work /home balance.

They always focus on the bad and never encourage associates to do better. They never commend you for a job well done unless you are one of their favorites. They do not like to tell you what you are doing wrong in your job. Instead, they tell you to figure out what you are doing wrong and fix it. If I knew what process I was doing wrong, I could correct it. Their schedule has been revamped and not very flexible for students/family life.

Poor experience,At Walmart I enjoyed it at first until the management was not taking care of serious situations like they should have been taken care of. I feel as though with many of situations it felt unsafe working there.,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Moraine, OH",8/3/19,2019,8,3
Enjoyed all six years I was an employee.,I've tried many times to get back on the work force. I'm considered in hireable due to an incident with a manager who is no longer at store. No one is.

Poor management and inconsiderate of the associates lives.,I felt like I had to meet all of walmart’s Needs. They tried to dictate my life and schedule.

Just like every other large corporation,"They say they care, but they don't. They try to get away with the most limited amount of staff possible.

The megacorporation,Walmart compensates adequately for the job duties typically expected. However work standards are not consistent from store to store despite Home Office's increasing efforts to centralize operations. Workers can generally expect.tl be treated like cogs in the machine. This is not to say there aren't many examples of good or great managers who genuinely care for their employees and try their best to encourage and enable them.

If you need help, forget about it. They stuck me in departments that I hadn't even been trained on, and reprimanded me if I took to long to get the merchandise stocked by spending ""too much time"" trying to assist customers. Everyone is just there to collect a paycheck, no one in management cared about the people working the floor, they just wanted as much work done as quickly as possible, and that was the only thing that mattered to them, not the customers, and not us.",1,Former Employee,stocker ,"Monroe, GA",8/3/19,2019,8,3

Management you had some of the best , instead of seeing them just as your manager I saw them as family do to connection , you had a very strong bond with fellow associates . The most enjoyable part of the job I would say would be helping customers , sometimes you'll have customers who shop daily begin to build a customer / associate relationship meaning they can come in the store shop , and come speak to you enjoying conversations , as you help find items or provide any information that they seek . The hardest part of the job honestly there's no hard part unless you personally make it hard for yourself , things can be a little frustrating at times but long as your self motivated , guiding yourself , I guarantee you'll make your job easy .",5,Current Employee,FRESH CAP 2 ASSOCIATE ,"Flowood, MS",8/2/19,2019,8,2

A ghost of it's former self.,"I loved my job when I worked at Walmart. I enjoyed the people I worked with, and there was always an opportunity for advancement if you showed the right attitude and work ethic. However, when our former Store manager retired and we received the manager that is currently there, things started to change at our store. Advancement opportunities were given to people based on their social relationship with the manager rather than their qualifications or work ethic. The store began to feel more stressful and the feeling of family that was there began to fade. Now that Walmart is making changes toward ecommerce as a company, it is even less of a decent place to work. Sure, the company raised the wages, but they slashed the hours of their associates. They are no longer understanding of familial situations, even if you are a single parent with no outside resources to help in the event of a child illness. Absences are counted against you, even with doctor's notes, except for in a few situations. Entire positions are being deleted to make room for their gravitation toward online shopping. As a whole, the company and the store that I worked at have become stressful and basically not worth it.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Idabel, OK",8/1/19,2019,8,1

Overall these are fair question/surveys.,A typical day at Walmart would be to push carts for a few hours and if anyone in the back was needed then I would be one of the people to be on call to attend and help stock and load items.

The management could be better, if a manager is in a bad mood then the day for the whole department is ruined, sometimes the managers will stand around in the back and talk for hours and hours about anything and everything and pick us associates to go and do their jobs. The hardest part of the job is pushing around and picking up the heavy carts and totes, then in the afternoon it gets even harder trying to work around the customers that are shopping.

The company has definitely changed over time,When I started at Walmart in 2002 the management would greet us sincerely every day. They cared about what was going on both in the associates lives and at work. They were very professional and personable. _x000D_Now I feel like the management only cares about department managers to some extent but everyone else is beneath them.

This place is terrible,"I worked the front end and electronics but I might as well have been working in every department. Management doesn't leave you alone long enough to actually get your work done and then they'll write you up for literally doing your job. They take the, ""customer is always right,"" saying far too literally, even when the customers are clearly in the wrong or they're lying to get you into trouble. And believe me, in the Rincon area, customers LOVE to lie to get you into trouble just because you gave them an answer they didn't want to hear. The management will never back up its employees and the benefits aren't worth it. I was worked to the point that I was doing the work of four people and when they gave us a raise to $11 minimum? Management told us we had to earn that raise, as if the hard workers hadn't been doing that the whole time. They keep the slackers there because the slackers are friends with management.

I have held on longer than many veterans who he's chased off, giving him and the company the benefit of the doubt, but I do not see things getting better at that store. The fact that he is still a store manager makes me think far less of the company as a whole, as I'm aware of at least a handful of ethics issues that have been brought to upper management's attention.",3,Current Employee,Lead Cake Decorator ,"Hartselle, AL",7/31/19,2019,7,31

"It's an okay place to work,but favoritism is shown",It's an okay place to work. You can tell that there is favoritism being shown towards certain employees because they get away with everything and barely do any work other than standing around talking. Most of the CSMs are cool and helpful. They have a computer that does the scheduling for them so just be aware this because if you don't change your availability once you first start it takes a while before the computer changes it for you.They have a point system also.,3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Madison, AL",7/31/19,2019,7,31

Worse place I’ve ever worked at,Very little to no training is given. The first day I got there they expected me to know everything just because I wasted 2 days of my time sitting on a computer doing an orientation. The managers abuse their employees and give them excessive work shifts. To make it worse I constantly heard them over the radio talking behind the backs of employees who made mistakes.

This is that place,"A typical day at work for me would be starting my day looking at the schedule to make sure I have proper coverage. Once I do, then I will place my associates in areas I know they can thrive. I've learned that things constantly change within the company so you always have to be on your toes. The workplace environment isn't bad, people are pretty friendly, and now we have a more relaxed dress code which makes the associates want to come to work, knowing they don't have to wear a uniform. The hardest part about my job is dealing with all the different personalities from my associates especially when they are having problems with each other.

very dysfunctional,while working at Walmart i've learned the workplace culture but also the most enjoyable parts of working there. at the Walmart in Benton harbor is that is was hard to work with supervisors and to talk to managers with out having favor. i was kind if dysfunctional without the managers noticing that job schedule being changed frequently and hey will blame it on the computers for changing schedules.,2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Benton Harbor, MI",7/30/19,2019,7,30

What its like working there.,A typical day at Walmart you walk in not even on the clock yet and management is telling you what to do.

Great coworkers but that's it.,"I've been there a few months & at first, I LOVED my job. You get breaks (or a lunch) every two hours, which is super helpful considering how stressful it can get in the front. Management above CSMs (customer service managers) is atrocious. The store manager is not helpful. Don't bother going to personnel if you need accommodations - you get shuffled off to a third party who doesn't keep you informed. You get 5 occurrences for every 6 months, but they don't all clear at once, each occurrence clears 6 months after it happened. Doctor's notes aren't accepted as an excuse to miss work so you will get an occurrence. Honestly, management is worse than the actual customers, and that says something in retail. I have never worked for a company so neglectful of their employees' health. The only way occurrences get excused is if you have PPTO, which you don't start building until your 90th day. Basically, if you have any chronic health conditions, don't work here. If you need time off, don't work here. If you want more than 20 hours per week, expect to have fully open availability. And also expect your late shifts to be followed by a shift at the crack of dawn the following day. I was not compensated enough to stay here.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"La Habra, CA",7/30/19,2019,7,30

The management was poor,"I got a decent amount of hours while working at Wal-Mart for working the part time job. However they did not offer any overtime, when it came to working the holidays they switched me to a full time position so that they didn't have to pay any overtime.

They work really well with your availability, but I usually had to put in for days almost a month ahead of time rather than the two weeks they told me. _x000D_It’s true when they say that management does not care about their workers. They will work you hard and long hours. You might have to work a night shift one day and an early morning shift the next. I was often given jobs outside of my job description and work that I was uncomfortable doing and wasn’t qualified for.

Look for a better job.,"This job was so stressful I hated my life and went to the doctor for antidepressants and anxiety meds. _x000D__x000D_I worked at two different Walmarts and both were terrible in their own ways. They lack help in every single department and pull people from other departments to help out, leaving little to no one in that department. How does that make sense? NEWS FLASH, having ONE PERSON to run electronics, photo lab,  OGP,  and freight is not okay. Hire more people or get some robots to help out._x000D__x000D_Customers were constantly talking down to me and yelling at me. This was an everyday occurrence. Management is a joke and will think you're lazy even when you work really hard. A customer tried to pull a fast one on me at the register one day and I had a mental breakdown. The CSM  embarrassed me even more and told me it was all my fault and walked away while I was crying at the register. Co-workers were unfriendly and rarely said 'hi'. All they did was gossip about everyone behind their backs._x000D__x000D_I could write a book on the horror stories I experienced while working here. I now work at a job with a positive work environment and managers that have your back when situations arise. Customers have a little more class and are easier to deal with because it is not Walmart. _x000D__x000D_As a side note, the managers at this particular store like to hide in the MO and play on their phones. I saw this on multiple occasions and especially when it was busy.",1,Former Employee,"Electronics, photolab, cashier ","Casper, WY (CY)",7/29/19,2019,7,29

Feeling of being unmoral,"As a manager I felt bad at times, especially when the store manager would tell me to fire someone in a meeting when he was supposed to be the open door. I felt like I fired people for some of the most minute reasons, but hey it's against company policy to chew gum on the sales floor... That's a good example.  This company has it's pros with it's cons. Some of the pros are the ability to move up in the company, but once you hit salary; say goodbye to your life. I swear I'd work 100 hours a week for four weeks leading up to inventory, black Friday and Christmas. Also I had copious amounts of vacation days 32 to be exact, yet I swear I only got 2 weeks of it in 4 years.

Company is changing,"My time working for Walmart was ever changing. When I first began the work experience and hopes for advancement were high! After working just a few short months we went into what they called “core hours”. I was hired on as full time working an exact 40 hours (I definitely couldn’t afford any less), but right before thanksgiving the core hours kicked in and everyone was dropped to 14-28 hours. This is difficult for people such as myself who has a family to provide for! Not to mention when I began working there we were on an 8 point system and in feb of 2019 that dropped to a 5 point system. At 5 points you were fired. I attempted a transfer when I was at 3 points and personal told me I couldn’t! That automatically showed me the company was changing too much making it nearly impossible for anyone to keep their position. Management varies per store and per person. I was on the night crew and had two managers. One of which lead by example and worked his tail off while the other could always be found sitting in her office playing on her phone or talking to other associates. I feel the company itself is trying to push full time employees out while hiring on more part timers. They are executing over night crews which is a terrible idea seeing as 1st and 2nd shift never finished their work and was left for us over nights where we could work quickly due to the lack of customers.

They refused to get our department supplies ordered on time, and then threatened to write us up for not doing our jobs. They wouldn't get the proper equipment in, and what they did get for us was ALWAYS breaking down. Then it would take them weeks to get it fixed. When a department was short handed on workers, us, the maintenance team was told to fill in. BUT, when our department needed help, we never got any. We were treated like 3rd class citizens. I worked my way up in 9 and a half years from 7.50/hour, to 10.95 an hour, BUT then they made all new hires come in at 11.00/hour, so I got a five cent raise for a whole year.

"Ok for part time, poor career choice.","Typical meat grinder retail management job._x000D_Department managers currently have one of the best schedules in the retail industry, assistant managers the worst.

The pto package for assistant managers looks good at first glance. It loses some of its shine once you realize you are pretty limited as to when you can use it. After you factor in all the holidays you will be busy preparing for (absolutely forget requesting ANY time off in November or December), the emtire month leading up to inventory and scheduling around all the other assistant managers time off you find you don't get a lot of choice as to when you can take your time off. _x000D_The stock options and 401k are good_x000D_All the veteran managers lament about how Walmart has changed for the worse in recent years as it pertains to the working evironment.

Good if you have nothing else.,Not much room for advancement to anything except normal retail management positions.

Management at the two locations I have worked at have been clueless about how to work with their employees and conduct business practices so that employee satisfaction, productivity, and customer experience are prioritized. The only thing prioritized are the store's bottom line and appearances. Workplace culture involves management telling you that everyone needs to work as a team and then not checking in while most of your ""team members"" proceed to actively work against you. _x000D_The second location I worked at in Houston employed a diverse range of employees, but in my department in particular, there were only employees of two ethnic backgrounds, and employees were forced into groups based on ethnicity, with one clearly being favored by supervisors and management of the same ethnicity.",1,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 1 Associate ,"Houston, TX",7/27/19,2019,7,27

Didn't get any benefits but did receive a discount card for 10% off Walmart purchases. _x000D__x000D_Cons: like at every Wal-Mart, customers are a nightmare. I've dealt with a lot of terrible customers just out to ruin someone's day. Made me too nervous to work in a retail and customer service ever again. My shifts were very random and inconsistent. The constant standing also hurt my feet so much but I was lucky enough to only have a 4 hour shift. The work pace was chaotic since you'd have your morning, afternoon, and evening rush hours to overwhelm you. But when it was slow it got so boring. Then there were moments when I'd have to ask what manager decided to put an underage cashier in self checkout and the tobacco checkout for 2 weeks. Yes this happened...",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Black River Falls, WI",7/27/19,2019,7,27
over all a wonderful place to work,Over all good needs more hands on training instead of throwing you in and its sink or swim.

Tough place to work for.,Promotions happened at random.  Often open positions would be unfilled for a long time.  The most qualified person rarely got promoted.  I always felt powerless in a dead-end job.  Even the manager of the store isn't allowed to decide when to turn on the air conditioner in the summertime.  That was controlled by someone hundreds of miles away or at least that was what we were told. Things broken or worn out in the store stayed that way for a very long time (years).  Sometimes in the middle of a shift there no was no managerial staff around to resolve customers' problems.  New rules would come from the branch manager then 3 weeks later they were forgotten and not taught to new employees by lower management.  A lot of turnover. Lots of low morale.  I tried to get promoted more than once.  The first time an Asst. Manager told me in interview I did well then said he already chosen someone else but interviewed me anyway because Walmart required 3 interviews for each position.  Everyone I worked with seemed frustrated with Walmart's confusing and sometimes pointless rules. Unless you are desperate for a job I don't recommend working there.  Save yourself the drama.,1,Former Employee,Garden Center Store Associate ,"Hadley, MA",7/26/19,2019,7,26

"Perpetual ""Part Time"" with Full-Time hours","The management team at my particular location was absolutely horrendous. They fired good workers who showed up every day and worked, and kept attractive ones who they were sleeping with and give them more hours so they could see them more.

Not cutting your overtime can result in you being fired; thanks ""Right to Work"" states. _x000D__x000D_They're constantly implementing new policies and not having a meeting to address them so that workers don't violate them on accident, and the management team would rather give a customer throwing a tantrum what they want than protect their workers from being assaulted by these same customers. _x000D__x000D_Long story short; only work at Walmart if you have no other choice.

Depending on your department it isn't really that bad.,I worked in the bakery and actually liked it quite well. I just didn't like being thrown around different shifts constantly. Many times you can ask to be trained in other areas but your voice is not really heard. You really are replaceable there so not causing issues is probably the best bet if you work there.

Summary for Walmart,Working at Walmart was stupid. I had the job for 3 months and basically got fired for having a medical emergency. When I started working there I had worked out with my manager that I would have to miss a week for family matters and she was okay with it. But in between then and the time for the family matters I had to miss a week for medical issues that left me in the hospital. They fired me after getting back from the family matter.

Never Work At Walmart.,"You are not treated like an employee or a person, you are seen as a dollar sign. The store manager is never there, makes 100k-200k a year, depending on how large their bonus is (which depends solely on scheduling as few associates across the store as possible) and when he is there he is either too good to even talk to you, or reprimanding you for something you’re falling behind on in your Department. The only reason that you are falling behind in your department is because you will typically spend your day helping in  every other department. Dollar signs don’t get sick, dollar signs don’t have other obligations in life. Therefore when you as a person do get sick or have other obligations, you are punished.

Walmart has incompetent and unprofessional managers,I worked for Walmart for 14 years. I made the work worthwhile only because of my dedication and positive attitude. Walmart culture strives to berate and beat down the hard working employees and ignore their concerns about the lack of consistency in holding everyone to the same standards. In the end I had many instances of unprofessional interactions with my upper management. I chose to leave because my concerns for a balanced workload between shifts was not taken into account.

It was overall a great  place to work at,"I enjoyed working at walmart for the time that I was there.

Walmart,Walmart does not think about life and work balance at all. Though they do pay well and have benefits it’s not worth signing your life away. I worked more than 13 hrs daily and they still wanted more.,2,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,"Austin, TX",7/25/19,2019,7,25
"The management was awful, and they couldn’t care less about their employees or the health of them.","The management was terrible, and they made me feel worthless any time they got the chance.

Just be a fly on the wall,Once your trained just be a fly on the wall is what I've learned to keep from giving them reasons to lay you off...I still currently work there on 3 years now. They play huge favoritism so learn to kiss butt beacause if ur not main management then you don't matter to them._x000D_Only good thing I've got to say is we get a small bonus every 3 months and a 10 percent discount card and you can use protected Protected paid time off or regular paid time off for requested time off to be paid time off but that paid time off accrues so slow...so if you want 1 week off you better save up ur paid time off for at least a minimum of 2 months in advance....they do not accept doctor notes and don't care about your children/family if u have to leave early.,4,Current Employee,Technician ,"Columbia, TN",7/25/19,2019,7,25

Walmart,It's a good company.  They care about their employees and have a good culture. They have recently increased the base pay of all the employees. I believe it was in an effort to reduce turnover. And the company has a fair attendance policy as well.,5,Current Employee,Money Center Cashier ,"Las Vegas, NV",7/25/19,2019,7,25

Extremely stressful,While the people I worked with were extremely nice my store was always understaffed which led to extremely angry customers and having  to work extremely hard to make up for any callouts that's occurred. Also not very prompt with receiving a reply about a transfer when my father died which forced me to relocate which led to me losing my job and having to apply financial strain on my sister,3,Former Employee,Self-Checkout Attendant ,"Athens, TN",7/25/19,2019,7,25
A day at work,"I would head to work, clock in, and I would get stuck with all the work and customers, and when I am doing other people’s jobs I can’t do mine, there’s no manager on board when they are they talk to the other employees and I would get yelled at by the big boss for not having my station clean or ready to go or leaving my station.",1,Former Employee,Photo Associate ,"Martinsville, VA",7/25/19,2019,7,25

Simple Grunt Work but Minimal Training,"Everything I did regularly I learned within the first two weeks, but I was working below what my pay was supposed to be for. I couldn't work behind a register due to the lack of training I had and management only helped with small tasks while being fairly lazy aka 'busy' at other times. Great first job though.",4,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"Wasco, CA",7/25/19,2019,7,25
Its ok.,"Some stores have a better management team. The management team can make or break the employee morale. Most stores are understaffed now, and a lot more are becoming under stocked.

Great except for managment,Corbin Walmart makes their own rules... but everything but management is great. I worked for 2 years perfect record and was fired because a new management member wanted someone else for my position. I got booted out for something very insignificant and sure enough was replaced with who he wanted.,4,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Corbin, KY",7/25/19,2019,7,25
Its a job,The training for my position wasn't clear. 3 years later everyone is doing their own thing. In return nothing is done correctly. But don't stress it. The culture is laid back. There I a flex schedule is the absolute best part of the job. You can work 4 hours and literally go home and make up the rest of the hours later in the week. The managers approve PTO doesn't matter.,3,Current Employee,Accounts Payable Specialist -GFR ,"Charlotte, NC",7/25/19,2019,7,25
Terrible place to work,All the management care about is money. Not all of them but a majority of them care about profit and making the customers happy. It’s hard to move up unless you are a favorite of one of the managers. They do not base your promotions on skill or hard work but on weather or not your liked by management. If you are a hard worker they take advantage of you. If something happens with customers they will always side with the customer and not protect there employee.,1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Denver, CO",7/25/19,2019,7,25

Negative,"It’s a decent job if you “want” a job, dealing with customers is okay, lot of issues with management; either never around or take their job seriously, lack of hands on training, everything computer based.

It was okay if your a yes man,"No set hours, a lot of awkward hours like (1:45-10:15). Management was so out of control they either didnt care to fire you or couldn't stand to lose you at all. They run on a point system 5 points and your gone. Unless you work a shift where they really need you, they will erase your points (which isn't fair to everyone around you).

Frustrated,"I had taken a pay cut to come to work with Walmart as apart of their management team, in hopes of less stress. After employment, I had no training as was promised by my wellness manager, and my department was very short staffed. I didn’t know what the procedures were for hiring and had to figure out department operations and hiring procedures on my own. First 3 months were very frustrating before getting help. It did get better after I got help. By then I was over the frustration and decided to move on.",3,Former Employee,Optical Manager ,"Madison, TN",7/25/19,2019,7,25
"Management lies, keep your head down and you're basically fine.","The company is going through a lot of policy changes recently, making it a worse place to work. Pay is above average but still feels short; they continue to increase the workload without hiring more people. Management tends to argue with you on every concern, brushing it aside. They'll say there's easy potential to advance or gain more hours at the start, but miraculously things change and it's no longer an option. And then they'll lie about upcoming policy changes even if there's evidence showing it. But overall, it's near impossible to be fired as long as you don't steal and show up on time: they'll moan about your productivity (even if you're fast, you're ""below where you should be""), but nothing ever happened.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service ,Texas,7/25/19,2019,7,25

Not worth it.,Everything about the pharmacy is a mess. Walmart in general isn’t the worst but I would not recommend the pharmacy. I worked there for 6+ years and in the months leading up to my departure were the most stressful I’d ever encountered. Not enough staff and hours always being cut despite being behind.

Not Worth It.,"My Career (Job) at walmart was suppose to be a stop gap. I recently moved to Missouri and never worked retail so I said why not. Overall you have some great co-workers some “lifers” who been there for 10 plus years so they feel they know the culture and systems well which is a gift and a curse. Because their insight is great when brand new but the entitlement that comes with the job not so much. Management sucks they don’t listen and they have no set routine or rarely follow the standard operating procedures they plan as they go which is a headache and no real routine. Most times they’re trying to cover their behinds so they won’t get yelled at by the xo-manger or store manager. Turnover is high because moral is always low. And for the decent starting pay for retail they expect you to fly to the moon, mars and th Milky Way and back fro 11.50 .

They are very cut throat no matter how many years you have worked for the company they get rid of devoted devoted employees over technicalities,To work really hard for a company to gain a position of management and when they pretty much tell you that you are too understanding and should step down or face possible termination otherwise  and then when you feel almost forced to step down and because a little loophole allows them to not only take your promotion rate but extra % earned prior to promotion that's Walmart n more,2,Former Employee,Mgr ,"Raynham, MA",7/25/19,2019,7,25

Bad,Probably the worst company I have ever worked for.  The management have favorites.  The hours sucks. The pay isn't good.  Management treats the hourly employees like trash.

Walmart is your life,"Walmart was the worst environment I have ever encountered. The employees are unhappy due to poor upper management and the persistent feeling of job insecurity. The plan is to have all AI doing the jobs in the near future. The smart associates leave, so what you have left are unhappy vets that make too much to leave and kids. I mean, even the Waltons cashed in their stock if that tells you anything. At a glance, it looks like you get paid a decent amount, but when you factor in all the overtime, you realize you are nothing but a glorified freight pusher because the regular associates throwing freight next to you are making the same amount hourly. Every month they are doing away with another department like personnel, so guess who picks up the slack? If you want a life and/ or see your family, find something else. You can do better.",1,Former Employee,Assistant Store Manager ,Alabama,7/24/19,2019,7,24
They treat you like a slave,Managers put their frustration on you no matter how good youre doing. The managers know they can get fired in a snap but instead of getting better jobs they just get angry at you for not working fast enough. They expect one person to do a 5 man job in one night and get mad and threaten you to stay overtime.good luck with the ridculous rules this place has. Walmart doesnt care about their employees bc in this walmart they dont allow sick days The coworkers that have worked there longer are super entitled and take their jobs WAY too seriously like you can tell some of these people barely got lives outside of walmart.

Drama and never enough,The job it's self is fine but management is really bad. Someone else who everyone sees doing wrong gets away with everything but someone who actually works gets wrote up and blamed for everything. I ended up in the hospital for two days and get yelled at cause I wanted more hours but had to call off. They aren't nice. It's actually a very dirty place and I am starting to hate going to work now. the hours they give you jump around where you can work a great week but the next you'll be lucky to have 20 hours. The only half way good thing would be the pay but not if you don't get enough hours cause then it turns out the instead the min wage paid more in the long run.,1,Current Employee,Fresh Cap Team 1 and Production ,"Taylorville, IL",7/24/19,2019,7,24

Don’t work at Walmart.,I’ve worked for Walmart for about 5 years and my friend who has worked for 21 years at Walmart makes just a little more than I do. New hires make the same as I do and there is no job security. Walmart as a corporation keeps making jobs and hiring people then getting rid of those jobs and leaving the workers wondering what job is going away next. The work itself isn’t bad but the drama and not knowing if you will have a job next week is too much for many of the people who work there.,1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker Walmart ,"Camdenton, MO",7/24/19,2019,7,24
Excellent Choice for a First Job,"Walmart's goals/ethics are superior. You learn a substantial amount of experience. They provide ongoing computer training, hands-on, and travel-to training classes. Further education for GED, business degrees, and learning other languages are encouraged and in most cases offered for free or $1/day through online courses for associates.

The pay is better than a good chunk of places and if you know how to handle people it's simple work. Just beware when management thinks you know something you don't or when their extremely forgetful. Them thinking I had been to the weekly meeting despite never going to them as I had the day off for school was an issue, as well as my manager forgetting to change my availability to match my new school times (college classes) caused me to gain absences and get fired.

Honestly not too bad,"I’ve held 5 salaried position at various companies and Walmart has been by far the best. The hours kind of suck but after a month or two, working 12 hours a day is a cake walk when you consider the salary. It’s fast paced and stressful and they expect A LOT out of you but the benefits are there, the salary is there, and when you have a good store manager it’s worth it. You start with 2 weeks of PTO and accumulate more over the years. They have top notch technology and a good HR department. Burnout rate among managers is incredibly high though.

Problem with walmart.,"Working at walmart can be challenging. There are not enough employees to perform the task which is need to run the store, there always short staff and the people that are there working are over worked with multiple task which are not realistic to complete in the time frame that is needed. Also when it comes to advancement or to step down, the management will not allow you due to the fact that if your an asset in one area they rather keep you there versus understanding your happiness of the work place. Walmart as a whole company is focus more on make the money versus actually customer and employee happiness. In my honest opinion, they have changed from what was originally wanted by the founder Sam Walton. Employees now are more unhappy and over worked and still not compensated as need be. Also the equipment that is needed to complete there task is also less, you can't do your job if you don't have the proper tools to do it.",3,Current Employee,Claims Associate ,"Portland, TX",7/23/19,2019,7,23

Awful  management.,"I can not say for the day time shift, but for the overnight management is was unbelievable how  Unorganized and disrespectful  they were. They would give you a area to stock that was to large for a person  who had not done that area to learn  in a night. They constantly  make you stay longer to help other people after your shift is over and threaten your job if you don't stay.

Then second night they see how you do on your own which is kind of scary at first but it went way better than I thought it would and actually got done with my whole department that night. When you really get into it time fly's so quick and your not always doing the same thing, you have multiple things that they teach you so it never got boring. Now I will be honest the only thing that I disliked and that really would get super boring is when we on the rare occasion don't have much freight to run and were doing a whole bunch of zoning.

Once upon a time people were proud to work here,"Walmart has shifted its original core values immensely over the last few years, specifically Sam Walton's belief in valuing the people who work for you. Corporate restructuring decisions are being made with little regard for the people who gave 20, 25, 30+ years of their life in service to the company. People have become simply a number to add or subtract to their bottom line. This disregard trickles all the way down from the corporate board room in Arkansas, to the regional, local, small groups of managers who hold painfully significant power over an individual's career and livelihood. Position placement decisions are being made by small groups of biased, incompetent, inexperienced, management cliques who care more about maintaining friendships than making integrity based decisions.  Imagine giving YEARS of your life, years of Thanksgivings, Christmases, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations etc. in service to the company, to be pushed out OVERNIGHT , with little to no warning. These are loyal people with consistent year over year, good performance evaluations who genuinely EARN their paychecks. Sad reality when an outstanding and consistent job performance is not enough to secure a job with the largest and most profitable retailer in the world. Sam Walton is turning in his grave.",3,Former Employee,HR Coordinator ,"Santa Maria, CA",7/23/19,2019,7,23

The managers were not as nice as they made it out to be,Overall working at Walmart was pretty good. We got paid $11 an hour. My complaints are the managers. They made the new hires do their jobs and expected them to stay overtime to get it done. If you didn’t stay overtime then they would frown upon it even though you do great at doing your assigned job. They made slick remarks but said them in a “nice” voice to hide how offensive it was. I ended up quitting after 6 months because I was having pregnancy problems and my doctor suggested that I got a sit down job. They don’t have sit down jobs so I asked for maternity leave but declined it because I didn’t work $40+ hours. I was confused on how they expected a 8month pregnant woman to work 40+ hours a week. I ended up having to quit because I couldn’t walk regularly because of my hips. I moved back,3,Former Employee,Shelf Stocker ,"New Albany, IN",7/23/19,2019,7,23

Such a terrible workplace and enviroment,"Working at Walmart was terrible... A typical work day would be me coming into work and getting yelled at by either a manager or customer about something I couldn't control. A manger would yell at me to make break to early or yell at me for something I couldn't do. A customer would yell because a manager is taking to long to help at the register I was at. Management at my Walmart is both nonexistent and terrible. They are terrible at making schedules as well. Even if you asked off and you also told them. They will act like they are listening, but when you check you schedule they schedule on that day you asked off and act like they never knew you told them. The workplace is just as laughable as the management there. Nothing is ever cleaned when it should be and also people will try to push their responsibilities on you when you have your own. I learned that you shouldn't rely on management there at all.

"Management has little consideration for individual needs, workload was physically taxing and put strain on my emotions, overall extremely stressful.","I worked in the  Electronics department for a few months then the Garden Center for a little less than 2 years. Loved it at first because I loved plants, but hated everything else. My department manager was ok, he was very pushy but he understood when I was having life issues. He was a nice guy but he gets very bossy under stress and frequently leaves to take a smoke break or do work elsewhere in the store, leaving me and one other associate alone most of the day. Frequently I was left to work by myself and the rate of customers needing assistance would cause me not to get any work done. I would be verbally punished when work was left incomplete too often and occasionally I was written up, meaning a strike, due to lack of performance when I was working my butt off. Explaining my situations gets me no mercy. My coworkers were nice for the most part. There would be some disagreements and irresponsibility between one or two of them, but I kept quiet unless it was hurting sales. The store manager was a complete jerk to everyone, not a lick of compassion or humanity in that guy. Blamed department managers for improper management of associates and and associates' poor performance. Dealt with this store manager for most of my time working with Walmart, ignoring most his complaints and focusing on my own problems. Last few months we worked with a new store manager who swapped with ours from another store. And with her, makes me wish for the jerk back. At least he got stuff done. This current manager is nicer to people face to face, but when it comes to doing work, shes awfully cruel. - more...",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate and Cashier ,"Ithaca, NY",7/22/19,2019,7,22

Stick to yourself strictly but cooperatively, DONT pull higher than quota at least until you understand the super extreme physical demands, and just remember don’t ever get sick enough to use the benefit LOS, which in turn slowly makes you replaceable at a higher rate than one might expect, and simply keep with the mindset your always wrong unless told otherwise.

The best and worst,I worked for Walmart a little over a year online grocery and it has taken a toll on my body! Position as a dispenser should be for a man! Lifting heavy totes 8 hours of day plus pulling a dolly with 8 full totes of food in it plus 50 lbs bags of dog food in either the summer hot 100 degrees weather or in the winter 25 to 30 degrees for the money paid is nothing for the work we were doing!Mgr never check the schedule to make sure we are staffed so the majority of the time we worked short!!

"Good coworkers, but annoying policies.","Work hours were good, but understaffing was rampant at the Walmart I worked at, and it shined especially bad between the 1st and 5th of the month every month. It's especially bad during the summer months where temperatures become borderline deadly, but the stockmen still gotta go out, bring in 150+ pounds of hot metal, which may or may not have wasps nesting inside the hollow parts of the carts, and do it quick so people can take more than they need, and we weren't allowed to take a break unless the indoor cart storage was full, and it only lasted about a minute before we had to go back out. And god help you if you're the only stockman on duty that day. Management was just kinda there, not really doing anything to help or hurt. All the coworkers were kind, except one other stockman, but he got fired, but it took entirely too long for that to happen. Most enjoyable parts of the job are when we got to slow down and talk to coworkers, cause if you aren't working, you could get penalized, which is dumb._x000D__x000D_Anyway, I'd only really recommend a job at Walmart if you're Superman levels of patient/strong/resistant to extreme heat and cold, or an actual robot.",3,Former Employee,Stockman ,"Everett, PA",7/21/19,2019,7,21

Everything you've heard is probably true...,"Every terrible thing you've heard about working for Walmart is probably true, honestly. The pay isn't good, they don't like to work with you on scheduling, and the associate benefits are nothing special. That, and the managers are almost all horrible, awful people. Seriously, like most of them are just terrible humans, though I think it's the Walmart culture that influences people that way. It was incredibly unpleasant to work there more often than it wasn't. Managers will lie to you about advancement opportunities to keep you in grinding in the same position, while dangling fruitless promises in front of you. They are manipulative, passive-aggressive and outright verbally and mentally abusive in some instances... and they get away with it. And if you speak up or have the audacity to defend yourself, they will absolutely retaliate and find a way to punish you. There is no form of associate recognition for your contributions and no one is there to support your development in the company. To quote the store manager ""you're paid to execute, not to think."" During the holiday season, they give you broken stuff that can't be sold anymore as your gift, because they're honestly that cheap (Largest retailer in the world: nothing says ""we value you"" like clearance bath care, mismatched candles or half a set of dishes. XD). AND! And, they don not take harassment claims seriously; it's disgraceful. Do not work there if you have any other prospects.

Approx 5-6 of us would actually work and make sure it's done right while the others goofed off and made our jobs harder. The part that I most hated was I got the only manager in the whole store that didn't like me or at least it seemed. Anytime I asked him a question he would not say a word to me even though I knew he heard me. All he did was stare at me and walk away.

Changes in setup has reduced advancement opportunity and has lowered moral.,Wal - mart is not the worst or the best company to work for.

High production and stress,"This job requires many long hours, up to 20, at work in a single day.

Productive and fast-paced with a nice break room,"I worked as a photo lab technician, but they also had me working in stationery and electronics. I thought it was a nice place at first. The store manager and the management were very unprofessional. Since we were usually short-staffed my department manager would ask me to cover shifts and I would. I was eventually coached for that reason since I received OT and was treated with a rude attitude during the process. Management really did not care about their employees and only watched their own backs. Even though management was unprofessional, it was an okay experience and I managed to learn quite a lot from there (customer service, cash handling, sales, patience).",3,Former Employee,PHOTO LAB ASSOCIATE ,"Port Isabel, TX 78578",7/19/19,2019,7,19
Good environment to work in,"I worked the overnight shift so I got there at 10 o clock and i would clock in and go to the staff meeting and thats where we were assigned our tasks if you didnt look on the kiosk prior to the meeting.

The most enjoyable part was my coworkers and the times we shared together.",3,Former Employee,Store Associate and Cashier ,"Viera, FL",7/19/19,2019,7,19
Advancement,No advancement opportunities or very poor.

And that because I had a relative working there I could notmmove up.,3,Former Employee,Service Desk Associate/Safety Lead ,"Clarkston, WA 99403",7/19/19,2019,7,19
Decent place to work,I was presented with opportunities to advance fairly quickly.  If you work hard and start to anticipate what management wants you will have an easy time. The managers were hit or miss but I was glad to have gotten a good one who would recognize effort.  I didn't mind the customers too much.  There were only a few that were over the top in the time that I was there and most wanted upper management to come and deal with them anyway.  I wish that there was more training in some areas.  I felt like I was thrown in to things a lot that I was expected to either sink or swim.,4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker/ Electronic Sales Associate ,"Villa Rica, GA",7/19/19,2019,7,19
good work enviroment. able to stay focused,pretty easy most of the time. got back problems so sometimes it caused an issue but otherwise was able work thru the day. best part of working there for me was being able to keep to myself and focus on my work. sometimes are job were to big to tackle in one shift so some things didnt get done on time but wasnt due to lack of trying,4,Former Employee,Stocker/Receiver ,"Muskegon, MI",7/19/19,2019,7,19

Exciting work space,I worked in toys and sporting goods when I worked for Walmart. I love working in sales and giving great customer service.

Good place to work,Overall at Walmart I only had a few problems and they were fixable. Walmart actually has a great system of pay and breaks.

Each store I worked at cut corners and let the works handle the short comings.,"In multiple stores: messy management, terrible ethics, short staffing, lack of care for workers, lack of acknowledgement for good workers. Overall a sad company. Many people there who deserve promotions after 10 years and aren't given them. Store managers are also over worked, and rundown. They do not revive enough pay.

Poor Job Culture,"There is no room for job advancement because they hire their friends and family from external sources. There is no way to balance work and being a parent. Management make a lot of mistakes and the associates have to reap from them. If management would actually take advice from the associates that do the job for 10-12 hours a day things may go a lot smoother.

"The management system was rigged, no one was there to help anyone especially managers, customers were horrible and the store was in constant turmoil.",The store rewarded poor performance with raises and promotions.

A great first job to gain general workplace experience.,Walmart is a fantastic place for someone's first job or to make cash on the side as a part time job.  Hard work is noticed by management and opportunities for advancement are there if you want them.  It is not good for a long-term plan if you don't want to advance as the yearly retail cycle becomes very repetitive if you're in the same position.  So go if you need to prove that you can hold a job for a year or need something while in between jobs.,4,Current Employee,Electronics Department Manager ,"Harleysville, PA",7/18/19,2019,7,18
no longer a company with a face,"The company is still a great company depending on the position in which you work in, the company does not have the same focus on its people as it once did and now unfortunately has turned into a mega corporation that relies heavily on metrics developed in a smaller controlled concept then rolled out into larger formats, and it is a brutal curve trying to reach the metrics, the company is always evolving and changing good or bad is up for the consumer to decide.",3,Current Employee,Co Store Manager ,Florida,7/18/19,2019,7,18

Not bad but needs improvement,"Walmart would be a decent place to work if their evaluations meant something.

It's fine as a first job,"Walmart is fine, the people you work with will make or break you, as will the customers you deal with.  The work isn't typically that difficult. It's not easy to advance very far if you aren't close to those on top. The pay of 11.50 an hour isn't bad either but it's well below a standard living cost. Overall wal-mart is just a fine first job.

Many hassels & not enough resources to do the job.,"I disliked working at Walmart the entire 4 years I was there. My number one complaint about the company is the lack of resources to do the job. The store was understaffed most of the time and if someone called off, it got worse. The handheld wireless computers frequently locked up (when you could get one), which was especially frustrating when you are trying to help a customer. My home department was electronics, but I would take bicycles down in Toys, generate hunting and fishing licenses in Sporting Goods, cut keys in Automotive, mix paint, cut fabric, help customers in shoes and on a rare occasion even assist in groceries. At times, I was required to spend several hours fronting shelves in groceries. There were a myriad of rules to follow for just about everything. There are not near enough price scanners located around the store and customers can be very difficult to deal with especially when they are drunk or high on drugs. The store operates on a bonus system based on business costs and many times employees and especially managers will get a bonus even when the store is running very poorly. I can give more examples, but I think I think I have made my point.",2,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Oregon, OH",7/18/19,2019,7,18

Toxic,"They want to demean at every turn.  Training is not to teach or help learn well, but like the world today, you read and hear a segment on a pc for 10-15 minutes, answer 5 questions.   Employee clicks a button to agree you’ve done the computer based training and they have what the company needs to say you’ve been trained.  They instruct new hires to sign new employee training forms at beginning of any mentor type training, (at bottom of page) which they’ll then say was  received, per signed document.  (They insist on it). Then they are on the new employee to get all the boxes completed.  Often without ever being introduced to a mentor. _x000D__x000D_They are looking for the best way to manipulate each employee.

Unfortunate that management cant even learn your name,"Not one individual I'm associated with can fondly look back at our time with Wal-Mart. It is possible in other towns it may be different. Through shifting management ranging from assistant managers all the way to the GM, things can be lost in passing including request for time off or even correctly informing superiors of issues brought to their attention.

Management doesn't support the associates in no way, they let the customers run all over you, treat you however they please. There is so much favoritism when you work here. The newer employees who started after you get moved into management positions compared to someone who has been there for over 2 years and knows everything about the department and how to run it. The hardest part of the job is knowing you walk into work dreading every day and wondering if you'll have a job. The most enjoyable part of the day is your other regular associates.

Some amazing benefits but glaring drawbacks as well,"Walmart is not a bad place to work necessarily.  The benefits and hours were great.  What was not so good was the management team.  Promotions from within the facility were a joke.  Instead of moving up the most qualified applicant the Walmart warehouse employs the ""good old boy"" system where if you are a favorite you are in whether you are qualified or not.  Tenured associates with degrees, relevant skills and the most knowledge were often picked over for those who ingratiated themselves to the management team.

I've learned a lot about maintaining product, FIFO and OSHA standards.  Your training is reliant on management, but managers are spread thin throughout the store.  I would say that the hardest part about the job would be meeting expectations of a heavy workload, while dealing with a constant flow of clientele, and picking up the slack of being short staffed.  I would say that the part that I enjoy most about my job is looking back at all of my hard work before I leave those doors, and seeing all of the customers being able to find what they need to find, because their expectations have been met.",4,Current Employee,Fresh Cap 1 Associate ,"Akron, OH",7/17/19,2019,7,17

Walmart,"As a cashier my day was spent at the register assisting customers at point of sale. I enjoyed assisting the customer and making the customer feel valued.  As a customer service manager, I enjoyed running the front end and assisting the front end associates.  I also enjoyed helping the customers with their questions/concerns. I trained in different areas so I was able to learn a little about each dept.  I believe that no matter where you work you should look and  behave professionally...on the floor, break room or break area, you should act and speak with the thought that customers are always around and can over hear conversations which at times can become inappropriate... because the associate feels that if they are on break they are free to behave differently than when in the building and some time management conducts themselves in the same manner or  not stop the associates behavior ….because it's WALMART.  I can't really say that I found my days working for Walmart hard or that there was a hardest part of  the day....I think work is what you make it...I wish management would have been more responsive to the associates needs when dealing with an upset customer or dealing with a shortage of supplies...bags, register tape …..also wished that associates were able to afford benefits offered.   however, I enjoyed my job, I liked interacting with my fellow associates and I enjoyed assisting the customer, from a carry out to a defective product, helping the customer understand and being able to give good customer service was always an enjoyable part of my day.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer service manager ,"Port Richey, FL",7/16/19,2019,7,16

If you don't slack off and do your job nobody will complain about you, and there is some positive reinforcement.

I remember the other day the customer was trying to do a price match on our app and the CSM is the only one who can approve price overrides, so CSM came and didn’t wanna do it for them because it wasn’t showing up on the Walmart app but it was for them, and it was for me and I didn’t wanna argue with my manager so I said okay that’s fine, I won’t override anything and I apologised to the customer. Sadly, they got into an argument with the front end customer service manager so they wanted to speak to a higher level manager. The assistant manager came and he was so rude to them I was just in shock. He later turned to me and yell at me for no apparent reason. He’s like “Why can’t you just do the blank ( inappropriate language)   add match! It’s so simple just DO IT!” I was like in my head, “If I could just do it I would have done it by now!” The disrespect I got that day by an assistant manager was shocking and disgusting. He literally yelled  in front of everyone! People were stopping and staring and wondering why he was so mad! I was too!  It literally wasn’t my fault at all. The customers defended  me though! They said to him, “Hey! She didn’t do nothing wrong, there’s no need to take your anger out on her when she was just simply trying to help us!” And he just stared at them and I bet he couldn’t fathom their response and that’s why he left without even fixing the issue! He left so angry and he didn’t even - more...",1,Current Employee,Cashier/Self-Checkout Host ,United States,7/15/19,2019,7,15

Stressful environment and lack of respect for employees,"The management had a lack of respect for the employees, the store itself was stressful and high-paced where favoritism for different employees ruled. You were given a lot of work with limited amount of time during your scheduled shift to complete. Lack of flexibility for compensating employees who gave more than 3 weeks of advancement. The help given within scheduling was limited and caused conflicts between management and employee.

"Fast paced, stressful, fun at times but lots of headaches","Loved working here, most of the people are great to work with, but management needs to be worked on.

Micro-managed at all times,"They said there was an open-door policy, but that's untrue. Went to the Manager with a problem and was then fired a few days later with no warning. The reason was not true either. They messed with my clock- in times and made it look like I was late and left early! I could never get all my work done because I was always asked to help other departments. The store was always a mess!! No time to clean it up.  And If you worked overtime to get your work done, you were asked to leave early on Friday. I was once asked to leave 2 1/2 hours early!!!  The department managers were a joke as were the support managers. They stood around and chatted, never giving any support or help to anyone. They just had a meeting at 6pm and told everyone where they needed to help out. It was usually not in your department. _x000D_You were given an ""Occurance"" if you called in sick. You were only given 9 occurances in a 6 month period. If you exceeded that, you were fired. _x000D_You would call a manager or assistant manager for help, and it was rare that one ever showed up!!! No consistency, and no recognition. You were made to take an hour lunch. _x000D_I held the keys to the jewelry department, so I had to let someone know when I was going  to use the bathroom. I was told my name was ""Where's_x000D_______?"" Because I couldn't hear the overhead speaker while in the bathroom!! For lunch, I could never find anyone to take the keys so I could go to lunch/dinner. I was left alone from 4pm to 10pm trying to clean up 2 departments! Shoes and Jewelry.

Dysfunctional Workplace with too many Managers,"The work itself is not hard and they offer decent benefits, but for every associate (employee) there are two managers. This results in a lack of communication, and a confusion of orders between management and associates. What's more is that even though they have radios on hand to communicate with each other, none of them let the others know if they need to borrow one of their associates so whenever a manager sees that their associate is gone the associate gets in trouble for something that was out of their control.

Working at Walmart,"Ii definitely enjoyed working at Walmart. They do have somewhat a complicated attendance policy. They don't also accept doctor notes if your sick and need to be out ,they judge it themselves basically, of if they feel if was that serious, which counts against you & can lead to termination if they decide they won't accept your doctors note. If my doctors note would've been accepted, I would still be working there.. But in my case, I also believe had it been a different manager, they would've accepted my note. so overall Walmart was great but some of the managers allow their superiority to take over , just because they have that ""power"".

The longer I worked there the worse it got,"Years ago, the pay was minimum wage, the attendance policy was bad, the paid time off was meh, raises were good, and the dress code wasn't appropriate for the pay or job. _x000D__x000D_Over the years the pay for new hires became better, but the current associates became disheartened when their raises were effectively wiped out. _x000D__x000D_The attendance policy became more forgiving, but easily abused. It's recently changed again. People still dont quite know what all it allows and does, and management likes to spread false information. I feel it is similar to the previous system in allowing some freedom, but am still unsure if I approve of it. 5 points and your terminated, 1 day is 1, special days are 2, lates and early ins are .5. But then those effect your bonuses every quarter, so if you miss more than 3 you dont get a bonus. you can also use protected paid time off to negate a point if youve built it up._x000D__x000D_Paid time off has changed twice, both times at the same time as the attendance policies. I loved the first change, and dislike/unsure about the newest. Originally, any vacation or personal time you got was dropped in a chunk on your anniversary. Now it trickles in with how many hours you work in a pay period. They recently cut our time earned to split it into ""protected paid time off"" which allows for missed days. I love the idea, hate that they took my vacation time. They have already gotten away with merging holiday pay into my ""vacation time"". I'm angry they took basically a third of my time for potential calling in.

Terrible work place...needs improvement!,"A typical workday would usually include a meeting at the beginning of each shift, we would then proceed to start work and 2-3 pallets would be given as an assigned work amount (NHM Workers). I learned a lot of thing during my time with the company, I learned how to make a baile, use the MC40& 70, I learned how to scan outs, and learned a lot about inventory. Some people from management are really abusive and others are really trying to help. The workplace culture that is brought to Walmart is one of the worst things about the company, the goals set by corporate are unrealistic and have caused a lot of people to hurt themselves and to feel trapped another thing that also was a pain was the fact that they make you do things that do not fit your job description, for example, there is no maintenance and you happen to be near the bathrooms and you get called to clean them or sometimes the managers have you do their assigned work because they ""have other things to attend to"" the hardest part about the jobs is that you have to do a minimum of 40 boxes every 30 minutes while also assisting multiple customers at the same time. when I had started working here I found it very enjoyable but the only thing I did like about this job was the hours and that I did manage to make some good friends along the way.",2,Former Employee,GM/ GROC Stocking Associate ,California,7/13/19,2019,7,13

After that it's just steady work. _x000D_    You absolutely have to stay very well hydrated, or you risk a heat stroke. Overall hey it's a job- and you don't have extra work beyond the lot all the time- just now and then. _x000D_   The pay is pretty good by my standards.

"Awesome people, hard work, retards as managers","I just quit this job about an hour ago. I worked their for 9 months, I started when I was 17 and I am 18 now. This job BLOWS. The people I met were truly amazing as co-workers, and I am so grateful to have gotten the chance to learn from them as a first job. I also learned this job pushes the limits of your body on the daily. I had to unload a 3,300 piece truck today with not enough people, or carts to put the stuff we unloaded onto. The management is awful and absolutely the worst kinds of people. My manager was a fat guy with a huge gold chain and a gold grill who acted like a gangster when his career was Walmart. He hires 17 year old kids and throws them in the juice aisle by themselves everyday and expects them to kill themselves every day. Today he tried me on the wrong day, after I worked for 5 hours without getting my 15 minute break or a 1 hour lunch break, he asked me if I wanted him to teach me how to do what I had already been doing for 5 hours. I said ""I f*cking quit bro"" threw my badge on the floor, and my vest in the trashcan for him to fish out for me. Even if you kill yourself working they still treat you like a newbie with no job experience who is lazy. I also got a horrible schedule. They started giving me 24 hours a week with my days all split up. So I would work 1 day then get 2 days off. That's not enough money for ANYBODY to survive unless they live in a cardboard box. So glad I left this toxic job. My advice to you is don't go for this position. You WILL be a slave. If it's a first job like it was for me, go for it.

Pay raises as a cashier,"Walmart claims that a cashier employee can get a $1.00 raise after 60-90 days but then find out that there are online tests we must do and then the raise will come but when it’s time to take the tests which are just here and there, never ending.

Management expectations are high,"I've worked for the same store for almost four years under various management, largely in the same role. Expectations are at times unrealistic.

Terrible Management,"So the store I worked at in Cypress, Tx was awesome and I was treated fairly and the culture in that store was much more positive and friendly  and you really felt like you are a part of a team. However, unfortunately I had to move for educational reasons and I transferred to a store in Corpus Christi. Absolutely the worst market I have ever seen and experienced. The management got on to all the hourly on every little thing, looking for an excuse to fire or write someone up. Many of my cashiers, door greeters, and cart-pusher are awesome but management could give two cents less about them. Cart pushers were left to push by hand as management refused to replace their cart mule as they pushed in the Texas heat. Also scheduling was terrible at that store as you could close till 11pm and open the next day at 7am. Management like to belittle and shame workers, always stating the negatives of a employee. _x000D__x000D_My pay was good and so were my benefits but it isn't worth it. At least in Corpus Christi.

"Low pay, full time employees hours cut in slow times","As in some of the politicians are saying, when trying to advance their stand...Walmart one of the biggest wealthiest corporations in all of America will allow their employees to be forced to sustain on Food stamps and other government assistance while they line their OWN pockets. Full time employees hours are routinely cut during slow times and management will have to work 75 hrs and be paid for 40. _x000D__x000D_It waa one of the ONLY places I have ever worked where I liked EACH and EVERY person I worked with and even those I didnt.

Always busy,Never enough help. Always so busy. Was a better company to work for 10 years ago. So many changes.

Working at Walmart,"The best part of working at Walmart  is as listed: The breaks are excellent(you get a 15 every two hours and a hour lunches)  job security and pay pretty good, and they have all the benefits you'd need. With that being said the pressure there is pretty bad. Not only do you feel like you have to do your job and remember every single detail, but you have to worry about be being watched and judged based on what you do and say to the co workers like a military zone .Drama tends to be high  You almost feel like a machine  the way they want you to clock in out only .00 but the previous job I worked there where no official breaks and I worked 10 hour shifts, but it does seem like if you smoke cigarettes you can take more breaks.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Summit County, OH",7/11/19,2019,7,11
Decent job,"Walmart offered plenty of room for advancement, but seemed rather selective. Anyone who didn't fit a certain criteria was moved to another station in the store so often that the person would quit for a sence of stability.

Complete lack of professionalism.",2,Former Employee,Courtesy Clerk ,"Vancouver, WA",7/11/19,2019,7,11
Walmart Rating,"Walmart is strict in their attendance, performance, professional policies. They excel at those competencies. The one thing they needs improvement in which is managing the number of employees they have on daily basis.

Stressful,"My typical day would start with clocking in, getting the required equipment needed to do my job. Scanner and printer.  Check the computer to see who has called in and check with my team so everyone is on the same page of what needs to be accomplished for the day. We would have a quick meeting and then go about our day.  Checking inventory and taking out what is needed on the sales floor. Keep checking in with my team to make sure everything is going smoothly.  I learned how manage a team and keep them focused on the goal for the day. Make sure the freight is making it to the floor to replenish the merchandise to be sold. The hardest part of my job would be having to fight with the managers to get on the same page stop changing the direction of the goals for the day.

Overall could have been great.,So the team that wasn't management was fantastic! A quick summary for the management at the location I was in. It's 2018 and a hurricane is flooding everything. It knocks out the freezers throughout the store. We have to toss everything. They employ a mod change while everything is empty. Working in either dairy or frozen you need two people. I am alone in the frozen area and I tell my supervisor. I am suppose to have someone from a different area come and assist me with breaking down the pallets. I am left alone for the rest of the day. This had been a consistent experience other then the coolers/freezers going out.,4,Former Employee,Stocker/Customer Service ,"Fayetteville, NC",7/11/19,2019,7,11

You are treated unfairly and at times feels like a slave. You work your tail off while some people that do the same job you are expected to do don't. And everyone gets the same percentage raise. So if you work your tail off or are lazy everyone is getting the same percentage rate. Also the way they are doing PTO now is not right as well. You have protected PTO and regular vacation.

The work culture is very loving and learning experience that comes with open arms.

Management however would consistently expect you to always get done at a specific time no matter what, even if it was a heavy load that day or if there weren't as many people as usual. If you surpassed their expectations one day they would fully expect you to always surpass it. They expect unbelievable speed from you, for example, the moto is 1 box a minute for stocking.

It’s a job,"Work there part time while I pursue a degree. Pay is pretty good for a part time job but definitely not somewhere to make a career out of it. Management likes to play favorites and do the bare minimum for the rest of associates. Scheduling by far is the worst issue there, they expect you to do the work of 3-4 people because they refuse to give people hours or flat out don’t hire. On top of that, your schedule can change at a moments notice with little regard to your outside life (school, babysitter, etc).

Move up quickly if you’re willing to work.,"I started out as an hourly grocery stocker with Walmart making minimum wage but even during my orientation I spoke about my want to make a career and move up. I was constantly asking questions, willing to learn new things outside my job duties, and spending time with personnel (HR) inquiring about openings. Within 6 months I was promoted to a Department Manager with a significant pay increase. I spent a year in that position learning more and more and never missing work unless I was ill or it was an emergency.

Management is more interested in perpetuating workplace drama and instilling fear/anxiety in the clinical staff than actually leading.

Beware Management,"Like any business, it really depends on the managers you work under. The issues I ran into happened because of not one, but multiple managers._x000D__x000D_- They don't like being told something is not possible, even when you explain why, and will even try to force you into a verbal agreement that you will (""Don't tell me you can't. Tell me you will, or yes"") . For example, asking staff of all ranks (associate, dept. manager, assistant managers) if 1 individual in an 6-8 hour shift, on a daily basis, is able to down stack 4-6 pallets varying between 4-6 feet high stacks of products, replenish 2-3 aisles worth (4-6 when you count both sides) of products, remove expired products, label and house over stock products, clear storage bins, scan labels and adjust numbers, adjust prices. Doing all that and help customers when they ask you, which can range from a quick answer to a simple question to being asked to look for a specific item that can take up to 10 or 20 minutes depending on how adamant they don't believe if you really searched because of how fast you return or that the store must have it as if it is not possible for something to be out of stock or being given additional tasks such as cashiering because someone called out that day or the store becomes busy, which I have had to do for 3-4 hours. Literally half of my shift. Even when told it is NOT possible by literally, everyone, they will still expect it to be done and make claims that they know it is possible because someone at another store is able to do it. If 1 person was able to do everything that was required to complete properly - more...",3,Former Employee,Dairy Associate ,"San Jose, CA",7/7/19,2019,7,7
I wouldn’t work for them again,They cut my hours for no reason when I was the 4th longest dispenser there. It seems as management has their favorites and will do anything for them. Everyone always seems to be on edge.,3,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Morris, IL",7/7/19,2019,7,7

"To use their own phrase, you're never given ""the tools to succeed.""","Management seems to lack basic human empathy, treating employees as replaceable cogs rather than actual people.

You're also lucky if you even get to work in your own department, with the store loving to move everyone, manager and associate alike, around the store at seemingly random._x000D__x000D_Even their supposed commitment to the customers seems like a sham, because they frequently make decisions regarding the associates/managers that directly affect the customers in a negative fashion. I genuinely wanted to help customers at my job, but I felt I never had the chance to properly do so. In one instance, I was so busy with customers that I couldn't 100% finish a task I'd been assigned by my support manager at the time, and I was reprimanded the next day for daring to ask my coworkers, and friends, to simply throw the resulting product in some boxes, label it, and put it in the bins._x000D__x000D_Simply put, you cannot win at this store, not with the customers or with your managers. Nor, now that I think about it, with the pay. Sure, they increased it, but it's sad when people who've worked there for years wind up getting paid less than the new hires, as was the case when I was there.",1,Former Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Butler, PA",7/6/19,2019,7,6

Very hard to aadvance from this position because it's impossible to do a ""good"" job. The starting pay is $11 an hour with a 2% raise annually. Their PTO polixy used to be alright but has changed recently to make it much worse. You get 6 call ins' a year and the first 4 cut your quarterly bonus by 25%.

Terrible environment led by incompetent managers that breed toxicity.,"Work is simple enough, but there are many people working there yet only a few seem to do any work. Most managers are controlling with power as they sit in the office and do nothing, whereas other managers who actually are on the floor working to get things done seem to have no say over anything since they are not the store managers favorite. This is a theme across all Walmart stores. While many of my coworkers where pleasant to work with, many others were already broken down by such an awful work experience where nothing can get done due to poor organization. Departments are placed in the way of other departments for no discernible reason other than ""that's how we've always done it"" and it hampers productivity having to wait 10 minutes for employees to move for you to even start picking for items to place on the shelves.

Toxic,"This is without a doubt the most toxic work environment that I have ever experienced. While I get along quite well with the majority of coworkers at my level, the management is entirely atrocious. Nothing is ever good enough. Take the time to do an amazing job, you took too long. Go through it fast, you did horribly. If you have one single item out of place, your entire job is a failure (and I've been told this directly to my face) and have your job threatened. Meanwhile, the vast majority of other workers, though I hesitate to call them that considering they do the opposite, can get away with doing nothing day in and day out. This means that two or three people are forced into doing the work of six or more, with no additional compensation. This job feels more like paid slavery than an actual job, and managers treat you as such. The store manager refuses to even acknowledge that anyone lower than him exists. Any formal complaints brought to his attention are responded with a ""I'll look into it"" and then are immediately forgotten. Yes, this company gives vacation time. Little good it does, however, as management has summarily denied any request of time off that I, and others, have put in. Personally, I have yet to get a vacation in nearly two years. Any accumulated hours beyond your ""cap"" is truncated each year, and not paid out whatsoever. Despite how much they brag about how they ""care about family"", the reality is that they don't. At all.

A fast paced job,"Walmart is a decent starting job. The pay was good, and coworkers were typically happy to teach. If you needed a manager's assistance, however, it could be difficult to reach them. You could also be moved to another department at a moment's notice if it was understaffed. This was difficult since they would just leave you there even if you have no knowledge on that department.",3,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Monroe, GA",7/5/19,2019,7,5

Worst place I've ever worked,"Horrible, inexperienced managers hired/promoted by their ""friends"" there so it seems.  I don't know for sure but the #1 complaint among my many coworkers is how poorly managed the store.  You know, that's the #1 complaint from customers too!!!  It's not a bad job, it's not hard, but they're so many minor irritations it wears on you.  Can you say ""lazy, immature petty coworkers""?  Of course that's not all the workers, some are quite nice, but they hire some mind numbing lazy and ignorant people.  Phewww.  The store is soooooo unkempt it's embarrassing really.  Coworkers using profanity loudly around families and children on the sales floor.  I'm no prude.  Believe me, far from it, but there's a time and a place for that and being around my coworkers that do it is embarrassing too.  They give you almost ZERO training.  They send you off with a coworker who basically does not care at all about training you.  Maybe they're not that great and you don't want to model yourself after them anyway, it's hard to know when you first start there.  Managers often aloof doing other things and don't supervise much.  Well, the cat's away, the mice will play.  Almost no one there takes the job seriously.  Not much team work, people out for themselves, shaving time off breaks, etc.  If you have questions about things because well, they don't train you, you have to ask your coworkers and 9/10 do not care at all about taking the time to show you or explain to you.  I've never worked somewhere where coworkers get so bent out of shape about things you're ""supposed to know"" that NO ONE TELLS YOU.  - more...",2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",7/5/19,2019,7,5

Good first job,I was an electronics associate. My department manager and co workers were cool. Walmart is like highschool so prepare for the drama. Our store manager was extremely lazy whenever he did decide to come in. Upper management flat out disrespects associates as if they never worked in our shoes. They fix your hours to make it 38 hrs a week so they dont have to give you full time benefits and hours.,3,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Highland, CA",7/5/19,2019,7,5
Decent job,Decent job if it's your only job. But if you're a full time student only wanting to work part time - this isn't the place to go. I was hired on with the promise of only have 20 hrs per week - I ended up working 36-38 hrs each week.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Berea, KY",7/4/19,2019,7,4
New opportunity,"It was an interesting job opportunity, I believe each job has something to teach you, however, Walmart specialty pharmacy has a wonderful idea that is poorly executed but some how works if that make sense.

When I first started working it was hard but once I got familiar with what I had to do my job was awesome I loved working I had no problem doing everything I had to do.

Its good for money but...,If you're looking for a job too just pay bill and nothing more then this is that job. The hours are inconsistent with weeks of any where to just ten hours to just under forty with no reason. Moral is nonexistent in the the store with managers hideing away in there offices unless they are forced out on too the floor and even then it is just till the can retreat to there hole in the wall. There is absolutely no commencation with home office and little thought is put in too how the changes they make impact the store.,2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Ogdensburg, NY",7/4/19,2019,7,4
"Disorganized, disrespectful, greedy",A typical day at Walmart was always filled with more tasks than could possiby be accomplished. This is done on purpose. They want you to push yourself hard constently. I learned that people can live on backstabbing and rumor spreading. The workplace culture reminded me of high school. The hardest part of the job was knowing which manager to obey since they were not a team and always looking for help to accomplish the overwhelming amount of tasks they were each assigned. The most enjoyable part of the day was clocking out.,1,Former Employee,MERCHANDISE SUPERVISOR ,"Lexington, SC",7/4/19,2019,7,4

Work environment was good but Management needs some work.,"I've enjoyed working at Walmart but some of the management members need some work, either but more training or by improving their additude. Some managers refused to work with each other and would constantly make calls that would result in a tough work environment or unsatisfied customer's. Also, for all my time working there, I never received my insurance card for the insurance I was paying for.

Overall my experience was great and i hated that i had to leave as soon as i did, i was having personal issues at home and it was a 45 minute drive for me almost everyday so it didn't work out how i wanted too. i'd say its a great job and fun experience overall.

Great Place to work as a Teen looking for some spare money.,"Okay so Walmart is a great place to work as a teenager. The starting pay at my location as a Fresh Cap Associate is about $12.90/hour and that pay can change depending on the store & whether you work in the morning or afternoons. Walmart is never consistent on hours unless you have worked there for a long time. They won't give you full time, only part time for a very very long time. Don't expect benefits besides a 10% discount card after 90 days of working there. Management was alright at my store, the HR Personnel Staff was great and welcoming, however the ASM's weren't nice or caring at all. Be prepared to work very fast during rush times and expect not to be appreciated at all for doing so. Overall, this is not a job you should expect to be your main job, it's a great side job or a job for a high schooler or a teen.",3,Current Employee,Fresh Cap 1 Associate ,"Goshen, IN",7/3/19,2019,7,3

Run away,"Walmart is not the company it used to be.  I worked for 5 stores in 2 different states for 8 years.  The work experience decreased over 8 years.  They took away the Sunday bonus.  The took away the overnight shift differential.  Department Managers used to have set Mon-Fri 7am to 4 pm shifts.  Now they are required to work 1 weekend day and have split days off.  The amount of stress can be debilitating.  The amount of  work is equal to what 3-4 employees used to do 10 years ago.  Most stores run on skeleton crews and only hire help during Blitz (Oct 31-Man 4).  They are pretty good about transferring stores and the benefits are good, but it doesn't make up for the pressure.  Constantly told ""If you don't like it, quit, we have 100 other people waiting for your job.""   Sad, but true.  Longevity counts for nothing.  I watched 20 year Department Managers busted down to Cashiers.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,California Arizona,7/3/19,2019,7,3

N/a,Walmart has just started what they refer to as a high performance culture. This would be a nice idea if the hourly associates were actually invested in the company instead of just themselves.

A workplace with great culture and room to advance,This is a fast paced workplace that will pay decent and offer good benefits. Work can get very busy at times and you will have to work overtime. Management is knowledgeable and everything runs smoothly.,5,Current Employee,Shipping Loader ,"Apple Valley, CA",7/3/19,2019,7,3
Flexible schedule,"Great benefits, flexible schedule. No overtime due to management bonuses. Great incentives quarterly, 401k match up to 6%, affordable insurance. Overall it has it's ups and downs but all jobs do.",4,Current Employee,Produce associate ,"San Antonio, TX",7/2/19,2019,7,2
I don’t recommend it,I worked five years for Walmart. I only worked in two stores. The experience was almost the same. Managers micromanaging and never actually lifting a finger to help you out in any way. You can work your butt off and never get a thank you from them. I was almost always very stressed and never looked forward to go work. Calling out seemed like the way to go. The job itself isn’t bad it’s just the managers that make it unbearable. Walmart may have okay pay and very good benefits but it all starts how management treats its employees. The last store I worked for my store manager rarely threw us cook outs or any sort of banquet. They never really care about the employees. They just want the job done. No one I worked with was actually happy. Most of them were usually looking for new jobs. I don’t recommend walmart. Not a very healthy environment.,2,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 1 Associate ,"Stafford, VA",7/2/19,2019,7,2
Over worked and under paid,"At Walmart in the pharmacy you had no opportunities to advance after achieving lead tech. Once I held that title, the job got repetitive with no reward of pay increase. The staff out in the store all got pay increases on the bottom line and the health and wellness was never boosted to compensate for the raises. This made the job much less desirable.",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,"Gun Barrel City, TX",7/2/19,2019,7,2
"got paid well, dealing with management was a hassle at times, the option to move up was not an option to everybody","a typical day at work was sometimes stressful, and often times there was poor management. associates will call in and management will not bother to find a replacement and there would be a shortage of associates",3,Current Employee,Fresh Associate ,"Hereford, TX",7/2/19,2019,7,2
Horrible,Management lacks communication. Constantly getting yelled at for no reason. Hard workers get frowned upon while the lazy get promoted. They will force u to take a really late lunch. Management will bully u if they don’t like you.,1,Current Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Mesa, AZ",7/2/19,2019,7,2
Its a good place to work they just need to take some pressure off the department managers and lend the support they need when they need it,The issue at wal mart is the fact that they put so much stress on managment positions that it take its toll on non manager positions they make it impossible for the managers to give the other associates the help they need 6,5,Former Employee,Deli & produce manager ,"Great Falls, MT6",7/2/19,2019,7,2

Walmart is a good company.,I liked the work but not all of my co-workers. Some of the people really are into gossiping and some are very lazy and some are rude. Although there are a few good people that i loved to hang out with. But the managers were awesome and really helped me out.,4,Current Employee,Deli Clerk/Customer Service ,"Sedalia, MO",7/2/19,2019,7,2
Its what you make of it,Walmart was a fun and great place to work I had the best store manger and deputy manager. The over night manger I had was very rude not only to the works but to the customers that would  come in to the store.i heard so many complaints about her but nothing ever got done about it. The pay was ok but I feel like if you work for a company you should make more then the new person they hire for the same job,5,Former Employee,Stocker/Maintenance ,"Springfield, MO",7/2/19,2019,7,2

It has Pros and Cons,Working at walmart has a lot going on in itself. You get good hours and can stay as busy as you want with great benefits but pay isnt the greatest and management is poor and lacks real guidance and communication amongst the other managers.,2,Former Employee,Many ,"Redmond, OR",7/2/19,2019,7,2
Fun place to work.,Overall I enjoyed my eight and a half years at Walmart. If I had any complaints it was because of understaffing and management turn over. If they still had greeters I would reapply.,4,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Morton, IL",7/2/19,2019,7,2
Competitive and political work enviornment,"Competitive work environment. Management doesn't adhere to policy but then will discipline you for it. Great way to learn the ins and outs of retail though.  Claim advancement opportunities, but there are only there if you are willing to play politics and brown-nose.

What I have learned in retail.,"The job can be very stressful and rewarding, in order to complete all work on a day to day basis. There are times where it can be time consuming and repetitive.

Teamwork made the dream work.",4,Current Employee,Bakery Associate ,"Palmdale, CA",7/2/19,2019,7,2
Confusing,"It was an okay job, but too many different people to boss you around. One higher up will ask you to do something, then another higher up asks you to do something different.

ok,It was fine when I first started a year ago but four managers later it has become annoying. I haven't received any of the promised bonuses and we let customers walk all over us at the front end.

Poor Management,"I was not able to take vacations for one week or two weeks at the same, My manager wants me to take one or two days this week, in another week another days. No holidays paid.

I enjoyed my job as a automotive technician.,I enjoyed working there as an automotive technician.  Once I took on a management position though my outlook on my job changed drastically.

Great group of people to work with,Pay is not comparable to job responsibilities.  The culture of the company has changed throughout the years.  All hiring is basically part-time now. Management does not take on a role of leadership (not all stores) because they are constantly being pressed to push sales and prevent shrinkage.,3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Savannah, GA",7/2/19,2019,7,2

"Paycheck is good, but the treatment is meh","The most of what I did while I worked for them was checking people out at the registers. Sometimes, they would have to send a door greeter on break, so they would ask me to cover for that person. This only happened a handful of times, however._x000D__x000D_I learned how to pick apart certain fruits and vegetables from them being brought to the register for check out.

They were strict, but not more than I would have expected._x000D__x000D_Workplace culture...I mean, what little I remember, most of the people I talked to were pretty friendly or ignored me entirely. There wasn't much workplace culture that I remember, honestly._x000D__x000D_Hardest part, it was a stressful job that pushed you to work incredibly fast. I would often get so busy I'd end up dreaming about still being at work after I went to bed that night._x000D__x000D_Most enjoyable part...either the nice coworkers, or the pay.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bartlesville, OK",7/2/19,2019,7,2
Low amount of hours.,They hire mostly part time. Then they cut hours for associates that have been there 1 year or longer and keep hiring people which lessens hours even more.

Good Place To Work; Lack of CSMs & Communication,"So, I am a currently new hired Cashier at Walmart, and as for now I truly enjoy it due to kind-hearted and helpful people. Even management is kind and helpful as well._x000D_However, though, there tends to be a lack of CSMs. For example: whenever someone needs change, they tend to take forever, and won't tell us the problem until an hour two later, and tend to take their time whenever there is trouble, which will cause the customer to just decide to leave the product behind, and kindly leave with the remainder of their products, or just leave in frustration._x000D_We also have new self-check outs, but the higher ups refused to update our registers, which are slow.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Denver, CO",7/2/19,2019,7,2

Horrible place to work,"The only reason I'm still here is because they pay me $15 an hour, having said that I started at $7.65 and it took 5 years to get my current salary due to inflation.. they now give a percentage of your pay for yearly raises/evaluation.

"Fast paced, Pay attention to detail, Communication skills","Prior to me working at Walmart I have never worked retail before. I must say it can be rewarding along with challenging.

Wal-Mart: It'a a job,"Wal-mart pays well; when i was hired on they paid me around 10.00 an hour; now they pay a bit more.

The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. Satisfied customers is a great accomplishment.

walmart,Not a very good work enviroment. No one is on the same page from one shift to the other. Its cut throat for sure.Gossip is very bad there and it hurts innocent people.  It can be a good place to work if everyone worked as a team but they do not. WalMart in other towns seem to run better and more open. Not all the stores are run the same and thats sad. Maybe if i were younger when i hired in i would think different but i was almost 60 when i was hired. There are some good people there though. Would i recommend Walmart as a place to work.

Deli was a terrible area to work,Management at this store was terrible. They expected way too much from one employee while allowing friends to do nothing.

I worked in the deli and there would be a line of customers and only one worker taking care of customers. Management would scream at the only worker waiting on customers to make pizzas now. I have seen management grab employees that were timid. I hated working for this store. If you worked overtime you had to get rid of it by taking longer lunch breaks.

The worst place to work,I worked for Walmart for 15 years and people just starting makes more than me. They also put people in a higher position that doesn't know anything about the store. I've never had a bad evaluation before until earlier this year and they say I did poorly. I was over 1/82 which is candy and items at the registers and cigarettes and b.c. batteries plus clip strips.

Poor communication with management not on same page.,Walmart is becoming worst and worst as time goes on. Management doesn't care about their associates like they use to. They have real poor communication  between each other and they can't make up there mind what they want you to do. They lie and say they don't say something when they did the day before.

As a cart pusher,"Walmart is a business concerned with customer satisfaction, but not necessarily employees. I was shifted to close and open the next day so I had little time to rest.

Productive and relaxed,"The huge downside is the wages. Lots of hard work doesn’t equate to how poorly you’re paid for doing more work than other departments. For example, you’re working so hard lifting really heavy stuff under time restraints as an unloader and only get paid a paltry sum. And if you don’t finish within the time frame your whole team runs the risk of being wrote up. However, if you work in a fresh area doing way less work, having all the freedom you could ask for and no time constraints on the work you do, you get paid more and have more opportunity to advance. It’s backwards as anything bad and very very poor on upper management.",3,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Processor of High Priced Inventory ,"Oxford, OH",7/2/19,2019,7,2
Great people and nice workplace,I learned and experience a lot at Walmart. Management would try to help as much as they could to keep the store running smoothly and the store is well organized.

"Productive and always busy, so there’s always something to do. The customers will make your day go by faster.","As an employee, I feel that the management could be much better than it is.

An okay experience,"From personal experience, the managers make it hard to come to work and enjoy it. They often make mistakes and will blame you for the directions they gave you. Promotions within the company usually come from who you know rather than the work that you put in. With all that being said, the checks are pretty decent, and the company does give you the opportunity to make good money. Walmart does offer flexible hours and the opportunity for well needed time off. You will make friends within the company (which will make the job less stressful), and that will be one of the things that will keep you there longer than you expect. Would I personally recommend Walmart as a job to someone? My answer would strongly depend on a few variables such as where the store is located and the managers that run said store.",3,Former Employee,Food Sales Associate ,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",7/1/19,2019,7,1

No work life balance as a salaried member of management,"As a manager, there is zero work life balance.  One weekend off a month is not sufficient.  At minimum 50 hours a week worked.

An infinite rainy day,"A typical day at work starts with you waking up in the morning and wondering if you should even go in and deal with the bull or not. Then you get there, you clock in and second guess that as well. You then proceed to get your ears chewed out my your salaried management team all day as they make you do everything but never lift a finger up themselves. I learned that being a salaried manager at a retail store means you tell people to do everything as you sit back and watch and if they don't complete the task in the time allotted you reprimand them even if insinuating circumstances prohibited them from completing their assigned tasks. The non-salaried associates are all cool and are definitely the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job is getting out of bed in order to get to the job.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Middletown, DE",7/1/19,2019,7,1
Lots of room for advancement,I really enjoyed my work experience while employed with Walmart and would and have recommended others to apply with the company. The quarterly bonuses were amazing.

Plenty of Stuff to do if you get your department done,"typical day at work was pretty much the same. Come and clock in, take out inventory and put them on the shelves, help customers with any inquires and helped out with the checkouts if needed. Mangement was not the greatest but was not expecting that much coming from them. They really didn't care about their employees and some of them made some comments which no manager should make to their employees. The Gen Manager was always out or on vacation and the bonuses... if you have been working there for 15 years.... is not even worth it and was probably given the majority to the general manager. People went and go like it was the plague but what is new. It was a place to get paid to barely scrape the bills. I would always ask for more hours and got denied since they didn't want to pay me full time to which then they would have to pay me in benefits, which at that point I wouldn't care. The lunches were 1 hour long.. which to me is not worth it, and if you clocked in even a minute early, the yell at you. Not a place to work long time due to management and pay/benefits from what I saw.",2,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Associate ,"La Plata, MD",7/1/19,2019,7,1

If bending, squatting, reaching, pulling, pushing, and lifting about 50 pounds is too strenuous, I suggest you keep looking for a job. You are mainly stocking items onto the shelves from the backroom everyday. Cashiers are constantly standing and have difficult break reliefs.

Great Pay and Benefits. Poor Management and Job Security,I personally did enjoy my job here for what it paid and what my duties and responsibilities were. The problem was how management handled everything. Any little mistake gets your written up (even if your not 100% liable). Also a lot of organization issues with assignment for the day.

So I believe we got blamed for their inability to release work on a more timely matter.,1,Former Employee,Picker ,"Chino, CA",7/1/19,2019,7,1

Poor job choice.,"Walmart does not care for its employees. If there's an emergency or any kind of issue in your life, Walmart would make you choose to either lose your job or keep working. A great example is a woman who had a heart attack was given a choice to keep working or lose her job if she gets in the ambulance. She lost her job. The excuse for their actions was that she missed to many days already and those were her only choices. Ex. for my experience was water coming out of a extension plug in. The manager wanted me to fix it. That is not a responsibility of mine. When something like that goes down you call an expert, he didn't want to. Of course he was furious with me and called an actual expert. Cry me a river.",1,Former Employee,Maintenance Worker ,"Timnath, CO",6/30/19,2019,6,30

Horrible Place to work. Avoid at all costs necessary.,"I worked at Walmart for a little over two years and I absolutely hated it. Management think they know everything. Walmart management always favors the customer over the  employee making the employee look like the victim. We were an Academy Store by the way. I hate the saying "" the customer is always right"" because customers now a days abuse it and take advantage of it, and management and customers threaten to call HQ but HQ doesn't care. At night its even worse especially on the weekends with no registers open and management standing around not helping us. Also Walmart does their schedules a month in advance so requesting personal time off is next to impossible. new hires get 4 points after the points you get fired. 6 months to a year the employees get 8 points. calling out is awful cuz Walmart can't do basic critical thinking when scheduling anybody in the store. We are always short staffed no matter what. customers are extremely abusive and you get coachings after many customer complaints which was the reason I quit. Overall if I had to rate this company I would give it a solid F. Its an awful place to work and avoid it at all costs necessary.",1,Former Employee,"Cashiering, Customer Service, Cleaning ","Marion, IA",6/30/19,2019,6,30

I will try to keep my main points in mind while writing this review._x000D__x000D_I work in the CAP Team 2 position, which is a 2 pm to 11 pm shift.  The hours make it difficult to spend time with family and/or friends.  While my loved ones get out at 4 or 5 pm, I'm still stuck working in the lowest paid; most overworked position in the store.  When I get home, everyone is sleep and I am still wide awake until 1:30 at the least.  I had expressed interest in transferring departments for a better life-work balance, and those requests are not heard.  While I get that I am considered one of the better members of the team and they need me on CAP, I feel my skills are better suited for another department._x000D__x000D_In many ways, I don't know if Wal-Mart actually knows what it wants from its workers.

Tolerable environment,"It was alright working here but it just wasn't for me personally. When there was a problem with something, managers sometimes took awhile to come fix it and customers got impatient quickly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers in a rush when I encountered a problem in the pricing or register. The most enjoyable part was my respectful and welcoming coworkers.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Vadnais Heights, MN",6/29/19,2019,6,29

Fast paced and interesting workplace with a good starting pay,"Typically as a cashier my day included greeting customers, scanning and bagging items, and dealing with customer situations. These could include pricing errors, coupons not working, or needing to wait on a CSM to be able to sell alcohol or to override some actions. The CSMs are very supportive and willing to work with you with break times and anything else in their control. However, the higher up management gives almost no support to their employees. While working there I had issues with being scheduled outside of my availability, not being given time off that had been requested months in advance, and not being able to get in contact with the managers to fix these issues.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Oshkosh, WI",6/29/19,2019,6,29

Poor department leadership,"I really enjoy my job, being responsible for the first impression of the store and keeping the department stocked as well as helping  customers.

You get a good amount of breaks, and if you work outside you are provided with plenty of cold water/Gatorade upon request.

It was pretty relaxed for the most part.,Walmart had plenty of ups and downs but for the most part it was very relaxed.

Its Depends on Management,This is not a horrible place to work. Like most places it depends on management. The benefits are awesome and the pay is not the worst. It was simply not enough for me. At this stage in life. The new store manager however did not care for the workers. _x000D_We had one night manager who did her best to bring up the the moral but she was working alone without the help of her colleagues or the store managers. This made it an uphill battle.

Not a good place to work for,"Worked for Cap 2 at a super Walmart in Algiers LA  (NOLA ) Unloading trucks But to make a long story short they would have me work in every place in the store and outside when they needed help accept  cash register  The location of the store was in Louisiana(Keep in mind of the hot temp) and sometimes they would have me retrieve carts in the parking lot, Re shop and managers that weren't my direct  managers would always try to push me to move faster calling my name on the intercom  to come to customer service for my re shop My work was never good enough for them and since I was always moving on the run I would have to drink water frequently That means trips to the bathroom and now they are  watching me go to the bathroom frequently also other store managers would complain to support managers and they would come to me directly  They also had a terrible system of writing people up called coaching If it were coaching then it would have been constructive criticism without a write up 3 write ups and they wiil fire you Favortism existed here Also conflict of interest There were employees that worked here where their mother or cousin would work and some were promoted to managers and would never have to do physical work You also had some employees who would move up the corp ladder by telling managers other peoples business With all that being said I would not recommend this job to anyone.",1,Former Employee,Receiving Cap 2 ,"Algiers, LA",6/29/19,2019,6,29

No such thing as a bad employee only bad management,I cant say anything for other stores but I worked at one of the underperforming Neighbrohood Markets. Outside of the basic online training you get management refuses to teach you. I had to rely on a coworker to learn what I actually needed beyond protocol. Place was heavily disorganized no matter how many times I'd set something I turn my back and it's a disaster again. Management was insufferable and suffocatingly micro.

This was YEARS ago,"My time at Wal-Mart was quite a long time ago, when I was still a high school student, but both my mother and I saw lots of issues with it. Despite company policies made for students to prevent things like this, I was often denied time off for extra curricular or legal obligations I had due to divorce orders with visitation rights.

Fun place to grow with yourself and those around you,I personally fell like Walmart was a good place to start at such a young age. I was able to learn from so many different people and about myself really. A typical work day was fun and the energy levels were high even when there was not much to do at the time. The most enjoyable part of my job was all these different people trying to blend together and figure out what the best ways are to work as one cohesive unit.

"Either fall in line, or face the wrath of vindictive managers",Walmart is a terrible company to work for. The bad reputation Walmart engenders in people's minds is well earned. One either needs to fall in line or face the wrath of a vindictive management structure designed to protect its own seemingly along racial lines.

Great to start off with,It’s a great job to start off with but I don’t recommend making a career out of it. Walmart has a no doctors note accepted policy so if you’re gravely sick and you have to miss a day then that’s an automatic 3 points. After 4 points that’s automatic termination. If you get overtime then that’s half a point. Walmart has several policies that they need to change in order for it to be a place to work at for long term.,4,Current Employee,Cashier ,Alabama,6/29/19,2019,6,29
Smoke and sunshine,Walmart claims to have an open door policy and wants to have a culture where people feel open to talk about issues and be part of solutions. Then when you go to them they tell you whatever to shut you up but never follow through with their end of tje agreement.  It's a never ending cycle of piling more and more on the employees and no pay raises (I had to fight for mine for 4 months) and just make your job harder at every turn. I'm really tired of feeling like I'm being beaten like a mule instead of respected as a hard working employee.,1,Current Employee,OVERNIGHT CASHIER ,"Queen Creek, AZ",6/29/19,2019,6,29

It has its ups and downs,"The most enjoyable parts about the job are the happy customers that you may encounter. The rest is history. There were constant problems and situations arising, whether it was the associates, management, customers, or even vendors.The associates and management on the team I worked with made the job a little bit more worth having. I learned that there is never a such thing as too much patience when you are dealing with anyone that isnt yourself.

Didn't really learn much except how to run the scrubber and other cleaning supplies, management is absolutely awful. Some of them have decent personalities but overall, when it comes to business, they do not care to push that to the side. They have unclear policies, and will fire people for things that they didn't know was wrong to do. Workplace was nice and laid back for the most part as long as you did your job.

Very diverse and interactive environment,"A typical day at work would consist of collecting carts and interacting with customers as often as possible. I've learned to be more outgoing and interactive with people. The hardest part of the job would be the weather, when it'd get too cold or hot, when it'd snow or rain would make for an overall bad working experience.

ineffective managment,"The managers are never on the same page, unless the store managers boss is there, which is more like bullying into conformity. They have unfair expectations, hard workers get punished while the ones who slack off get all the breaks. Constant policy changes are hard to keep up with mainly because of the lack of communication.

Terrible job,They treat you terribly and make you do more then your position describes without paying you more money to do it. If your pregnant or sick and go to the doctor and can’t come to work they don’t care even if you bring an ER note stating so. They treat their staff terribly and the managers disappear and talk trash about customers and staff sometimes even to their face. It’s a good first job but not for long term at all.,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Avon, IN",6/28/19,2019,6,28

Highly recommend to have with a second job since there is little progress to be made.,3,Current Employee,ELECTRONICS SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Montgomery, AL",6/28/19,2019,6,28
"It's alright, put bread on the table","I've worked at 2 different locations, and management is always a problem. There is little communication between employees, making tasks harder to complete. The way they do their scheduling is really frustrating as an employee, which is honestly all too common in this industry these days. You will need to change your availability and choose your days off or you will always work 5 days a week, even if they are short shifts each day. Days off are often separate. Scheduling isn't consistent so planning trips and events with friends and family is difficult. The company will keep you just under 40 hours to keep you from benefits you would otherwise receive. The pay is decent if you live in any state other than WA, otherwise you are still making basically minimum. It's retail, so it comes with all the frustration of dealing with the public; as well as slacking employees. Overall not a horrible place to work if you're not looking to develop a career in your job. If you are, however, I would suggest looking elsewhere.",3,Former Employee,"Deli Associate, Cashier, Overnight Stocker ","Puyallup, Wa, Aberdeen, WA",6/28/19,2019,6,28

Mismanaged and Unprofessional,Walmart is a good retail job if you get with the right management. Unfortunately i got stuck with a bad manager. I had nothing against him as a person still say hi in public and ask how his day is going. But as for a manager i cant work for someone who takes your hours and doesn't pay you for the ones worked.

It's going down hill,A typical day at work could go any way. Management gives several different instructions to complete throughout and expect you to get everything done while your number one priority is the customer. It's always understaffed .

The morning shift starts at 4 am and tmyou get off at 1pm. They work with most of the truck and stock for the day. 2nd shift is 1 PM to 10 PM. The shift is focused on keeping the floor filled and the food fresh. There are some pretty disgusting tasks (disposal of both the meat departments write offs and the produce departments write offs.).

"Decent job, great coworkers, terrible management","First off, I want to say that my coworkers are amazing. We joke around while stocking and unloading the truck, which makes it go by faster. I've made several work friends here, and I can honestly say that there are only one or two coworkers that I actually dislike. One of my supervisors is pretty chill, too. Even when he is stressed, he rarely takes it out on the rest of us. I appreciate that quality._x000D__x000D_Having said that, the management is awful. They continually expect us to do impossible tasks. They'll take people off of unloading the truck, and then expect the rest of us to finish it quicker with less people. When we have two-truck nights, they expect us to stock everything that came off of the trucks, even though it takes us the majority of the night to unload both of them. One of the managers, when supervising for the night, referred to it as ""babysitting."" Needless to say, that was a little aggravating, since we were the ones doing all of the hard work and she was literally just standing there watching us. I could go on and on about the management... suffice it to say that management is consistently petty._x000D__x000D_I do enjoy the two 15 minute breaks, though. The hour lunch is also nice, although I wish it wasn't unpaid. One thing to note is that occasionally you will be forced to work past the times that you ""should"" be taking your breaks. Fortunately, you are still mandated to take them, so it just means that you take it later in the day._x000D__x000D_The job itself isn't too bad at all.

Overall its a great Company,Walmart is a great company to work for. It is also a secure job. The benefits are good along with their 401k plan. The only downside to Walmart is they do not have a retirement plan. You would have to invest into the 401k plan to have something for later on in your life. Walmart will match 100% of what you put into your 401k. I think that is a great thing that they do that for their employees.

"Super fast paced, nothing was ever good enough for them","I was trained as a jewelry associate. Which also encompasses shoe stocking. Checking in freight and processing it isn't that difficult. When you are expected to do every piece of freight and wait on every customer It gets to be too much. Many times I was told to focus on freight and not pay attention to customers. obviously customer service should be number one priority. Without the customers we wouldn't need to order in any freight because no one would shop there. Dealt with many disgruntled customers. It just seemed that no amount of effort was ever enough to please management. Also there were so many managers around it was actually confusing. You could get told what to do by 4:00 or 5:00 different managers. So it got to be difficult to decide which tasks I was actually supposed to try to accomplish. All the while dealing with actual customers. I wish it was more focused on customers, I really liked my job. I got two pierced people's ears.

Some good customers and supervisors can be nice,A typical day at work was standing on my feet in the same spot for about 3 hours until we got out breaks. The customers were generally nice and being in a small town you recognized many of the faces and were able to strike up a quick chat with them as you proceeded to check out their items they had purchased. The hardest part was when someone didn't have the money to pay for everything that they had paid for and so you had to deny them. Sometimes once in a blue moon you would find the good people with golden hearts who would help those who couldn't pay for their stuff and they would help them out. At one point I watch 3 people help a mother of 3 with one on the way and she was working and she had food stamps. They all helped her out. It made my eyes water up because it reminded me that there is still good left in this world. The management was iffy some days. They were all good people who hated their jobs sometimes and there were those who were truly rotten apples. I was lucky and unlucky to have both. I got more great managers than bad and to this day I can go in and see and talk to 2 of my favorite ones and catch up.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Leavenworth, KS",6/26/19,2019,6,26

Challenging fast paced work environment,"Working for a retail establishment has its challenges, for sure. You never have a dull moment. I've learned a lot about the differences in people on a daily basis, and how to cope with the ever changing attitudes. I've also learned that sometimes people just want someone to listen. The hardest part of the job is not getting frustrated with indignant customers who may just be having a bad day and no one else to vent to, and the most enjoyable part of the job is hearing the customers complement my stores practices and ethics.",4,Current Employee,Day Stock Associate ,"Hope Mills, NC",6/25/19,2019,6,25

Great benefits Horrible work environment,Walmart as a company provides no stability for its employees. They are worked endlessly with horrible wages.

A terrible place to work,I enjoyed the actual work I did at Walmart and was very fond of the people I worked with. That is all I can say that was good about Walmart. I can't imagine a worse place to work. Management is absolutely incompetent and abusive to its employees. There is absolutely NO training for anything. It is sink or swim. Employees work in an atmosphere of being fired every minute of their working day. Employees are pushed constantly to the point of exhaustion. I compare it to being in a prison (although I have never been in one)._x000D_I would never recommend Walmart to anyone.,1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Marina, CA",6/25/19,2019,6,25

Policy changed,"The company went downhill when the policies kept changing. They don't care about you.

Fast paced,"When I first got the job I was excited to get paid more than my fast food job, I work less days than I did at the fast food place but I get paid more, one thing is for sure you need to make the rate that they ask and not a unit less or you’ll be slapped with an occurrence, they do hand out occurrences like candy but as long as you work hard everyday then no need to worry",4,Current Employee,Warehouse Worker ,"Chino, CA",6/25/19,2019,6,25
good work but i was done wrong,"overall i worked for the company for a little over 6 years in two different states. when i initially moved to texas, i was told that there was a job offer for the position that i was in before the move. upon getting to the state, two different stores stated something different. i was demoted and had money taken from me due to that. i was not able to get my previous position back nor even given the chance to get it back, being told several times that there was not a position open. if you are not wanting to move up, it's not a bad place to work at all.",3,Former Employee,Customer service associate ,"Killeen, TX",6/25/19,2019,6,25
Stressful environment,"Walmart has a poor work environment and poor management.   Schedules are random and show no regard for an employee's personal life.  Benefits and incentives are being cut all the time.  Departments are minimally covered, which places stress on employees and customers.",5,Current Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Roanoke, VA",6/25/19,2019,6,25
