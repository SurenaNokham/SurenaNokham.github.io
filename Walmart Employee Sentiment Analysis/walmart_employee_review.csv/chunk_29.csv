While management can be difficult to deal with sometimes, if you are good at your job and can tough it out long enough your chances of moving up are really high. The hardest part of the job is obviously the bad customers, but the good ones outweigh the bad ones so much that you hardly notice them. If you're looking for a place to start or even a place to retire, Walmart is a really good option.

They try to work with you even though it doesnt always seem that way,Walmarts typical work day includes your everyday training for your position you filled for but there are days you have to go above and beyond without even having a say in anything and i respect that because it has to be done.

Typical Job Expectations,"As a Cashier I would say its probably like any other cashiering job, only difference is if you didn't price match. I think that is the only down side. They're strict on cashiers on ""not to give out price matches without AD"" yet, a customer will ask for a supervisor and a supervisor will just let them have it, which continues that cycle of customers not taking us serious. So then you just allow the customers to get those matches (if fairly priced) and you get in trouble. So management, supervisors, and cashiers need to be there for each other.

They like to find loopholes,Certain aspects of the job are ok. I enjoy my coworkers and maybe a few members of management. But the home office has too much say over the way an individual store is run. What works for one store doesn't necessarily work for another. They also constantly change their minds about one thing or another. They find loopholes to screw a person over without actually breaking policy. Like creating a shift that is 5.5 hours long. As long as you are under 6 hrs you don't get a lunch. Only one 15 min break. Doesn't sound too bad except these shifts are almost always right through lunch or supper. Like 9:30-3 or 4:30-10. Still not terrible. Unless you are a cashier where you must stand in essentially one spot for the entirety of your shift. It takes its toll on knees and legs and your back. The pain is unbearable.,1,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Stephenville, TX",5/11/17,2017,5,11

If your manager is having a bad day I guarantee they will take it out on you. It will go all the way down the line until it reaches the customer. My 7 years there I learned that Wal-Mart doesn't appreciate and undervalues hard workers.

Not the place. im not certain its all stores, or just the specific location. The customers werent always bad, but when they were, they had to be the epitome of a bad customer. Dont ever hit your 5 hour of working, under no circumstance, you get in trouble. If no one relieves you for your break, leave, walk off, tell a manager to get someone to cover, cause you will get coaching for not taking your breaks on time. Dont stay for overtime if they ask, its a trap. smile or not. Closing was always a hassle and a half. Some managers talk down on you and not to you. communication is key. Managers are less personable. Managers will undermine you after an argument with a customer. Customers are most of the time stubborn and ill informed. To many duties for not enough mangers. A typical day is always stressful for at least 6 hours. The only thing that kept me going is my co workers who would experience the same drama i did, and would talk it out, and just relax. Almost like a decompressing therapy session. Then back you you daily sentence. It is not a happy environment.

Don't even bother.,I spent 5 years of my life at walmart and the only thing I was able to walk away with was the knowledge that management will stress you as thin as paper and not even appreciate you for it. Their benefits are only good for full time workers but they make sure to give you just under 40 hours so you aren't considered full time. Just an awful awful awful company and I am so thankful I was able to get away.,2,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Lake Charles, LA",5/10/17,2017,5,10
Setup for Failure,"Wal-Mart was one of those companies who took advantage of meeting the minimum requirements to avoid paying you at full-time rates. 38 hours weekly was the required schedule, and 40 hours would allow full-time benefits.

Training was minimal, and coverage was so dismal that I rarely worked the position I was actually hired for.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Orange Park, FL",5/10/17,2017,5,10
It's changing,Walmart used to be a great company to work for but with the current changes in leadership it is harder to work there.

Retail department manager for walmart jewelry,All in all Walmarts other bad place to work the people can be nice it depends on what store I deal with customers every single day up close and personal whatever ask for help by other management or staff it's very hard to get somebody to come over and help because everyone's too busy and they always take from my department instead of give Walmart's very understaffed they may be paying people more an hour but they don't have as many people working for them and that's where the the problems have come in management says they listen however you don't see any changes being made.however if you are young and don't mind not moving up in the company it's a good place to work. Working at Walmart hasn't been all that bad I enjoy everyone I work with I just think that the management team has double standards and for seven years I've been told that I'm ready to move up to be an assistant manager but then we get a new store managers in each time I'm ready and I get knocked back down because I have to prove myself to that new person coming in,2,Current Employee,Dept.

This job is what you make of it.,"For one of the hardest jobs you'll ever love, this job compares to most I have held in my lifetime. I always get to work at least 15 minutes early to soak in the atmosphere of the day.(knowing how hectic it might be). Always ready to dive in and start helping customers with finding what they need as an associate cashier. Using my own hand held technology instead of waiting for a service manager with a store computer in helping finding and locating products.

Working hard pays off,"I was able to quickly move up the ranks while working hard at Walmart. My managers were fair and know how to see potential, unfortunately this occasionally resulted in some strong favoritism. I began my career answering phones and folding sweaters and ended up as the head of 5 departments. I maintained inventory control and counts, occasionally ordered stock, did paperwork daily, controlled the backroom, handled customer service, and supervised ~5 employees. Really I did a bit of everything. I enjoyed the diversity the job offered, one day I could be in the back all day, or handling guests for a majority of the time, or even stocking quietly. I really enjoyed the paperwork strangely enough. The other employees were kind and we had a little community going on.",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,Oklahoma,5/10/17,2017,5,10

Productive and fun company,"A typical day at work started with the team putting the line together and unloading one sometimes two trucks with over 3,000 pieces each on them on the correct pallets laid out for each department in the assigned spaces. Take our first fifteen minute break and then be assigned to specific areas by our supervisor. We would take rocket carts of freight from our assigned areas out to the floor and work them until lunch. After lunch we would pull the left over freight on pallets to the floor to the assigned spaces and departments. Each member(s) of the team would go back to their assigned departments to stock the rest of the merchandise. We also cleaned the back room and did any other tasks our supervisor asked of us. I learned quickly how fast paced the back room was and all the hard work that was done each day. Management is awesome, always willing to help out as best as they can! The hardest part of the job is remembering what goes where and department numbers.

Working at Walmart,Working there was an ok job. The people are pretty nice and try to work as a team to the best of their ability. Management kinda depends on the person that you will get.

Times have changed,"In my professional opinion, Wal-Mart does not care about it's associate's lives outside of work, your performance, or your satisfaction with the job.

good place to work for college student,While in college I worked at Wal-Mart. My managers knew that I was in school and that would be my first priority so they worked really well with my schedule and if I needed to request days off. They were also willing to work with me on holidays because I was a couple of hours away from my family. One thing I did not like about working there was that because I was in school they would not allow me to move up in the company which I did not think was fair because I always received good reviews from customers as well as co-workers.,3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Stephenville, TX 76401",5/9/17,2017,5,9

I am also responsible for customer service. While working as a customer service associate I issue money orders, do returns/ exchanges and cash checks. Working at Walmart has helped me come out of my shell and deal with unexpected situations. Workplace at Walmart is very diverse.

Half the time management doesn't know what to do, or what is going on to direct the staff. It is extremely hard to move up in the company, and policies are set in place so that it is almost impossible to progress. _x000D_There are very very many cons to Walmart but some pros, they have recently up'd their wages in all departments to a more livable wage and they do allow a very nice set of labor laws so that employees don't get burnt out. _x000D_All in all, I wouldn't suggest someone apply at Walmart unless they were desperate for a job, because the pay is now better.",4,Current Employee,Certified Pharmacy Technician ,"Stoughton, WI",5/9/17,2017,5,9

"Great Coworkers, Sloppy Management","Hours were decent, but management refused to keep a full staff leading to overtime issues such as half of management demanding you to work overtime, and the other half telling you if you get so much as 1 minute over you would lose it or be fired. Often you would be forced to go home early or take a long lunch so you wouldn't go past your scheduled hours whether they be 40 or 21, but if asked you could be given extra hours depending on the manager.

Challenging work environment,"I love Walmart and I personally think they are a great company to work for.  I think Walmart is definitely responding to changes in pharmacy.  They are committed to clinical services and immunizations all while trying to meet customer demands in a timely fashion.  A typical day at work begins by trying to get all refills done and processing the order prior to opening the pharmacy.  We work all day in trying to finish all scripts in 20 minutes or less so that we can meet the order performance requirements given us by Walmart.  We educate on vaccinations daily at every opportunity.  Walmart has a motto on clinical services, Advocacy at every Opportunity, and I love this.  _x000D__x000D_I have learned how to motivate a team to lead the market in immunizations and to lead in input accuracy and order performance.  I have learned how to coach for success, those employees that do not perform at the level required by Walmart.  My personal management style is to lead with high energy and enthusiasm.  I like to set out clear expectations in the form of goals, and then get personally excited when they are met.  This inspires team members to work hard and to excel.  I love this profession and I love helping customers and I know that my enthusiasm is contagious.  _x000D__x000D_The hardest part of my work is to manage time effectively so that I can get management tasks done while at the same time keeping the pharmacy neat and clinically clean and just be a pharmacist helping customers get the best experience.

Not very fun to work here,Emotionally and Physically draining place to work. The pay is better than most of the company's peers. But that is becoming the only good part about working here. Many coaches and supervisors play favorites. We are losing the ability to see family for holidays. Very limited break time.,2,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Ottawa, KS",5/9/17,2017,5,9
Mental Break,"I already had a lot going on at home. So when you have to go to work where everyone singles you out and doesn't even want to speak with you it gets really depressing. It makes thing much worse when you get written up for using a southern mannerism with no intent of hurting someone's feelings. then to top it off, the person who is suppose to be your coach tells you to your face that it's not her fault that no one in the store likes you. then just turns around and walks away.

would never recommend,"In my experience with working at Walmart, managers are poor and play favorites. No opportunity for advancement unless you were a favorite. I worked 40 hours a week, but was only considered part time, therefore I was working full time hours with no full time benefits. Your work load can take more time than you have to work. I was pregnant and still required to pick up 40+ lbs even though I was restricted to 25. I only ever got to work late shifts because of the favortisim, even though I asked to work some early shifts so I could spend time with my son.

It was one of my best jobs yet worse.,Walmart was very beneficial that's why I stuck with it as long as I did. It's not just the benefits but the pay also.

Stressful,"The store I worked at, I loved management. They were nice and friendly and had realistic expectations of their employees. The customers weren't always the nicest. The cashier got blamed for the cost of the item, out of stocks, or if an item didn't scan. Many people don't realize that those issues are all out of the cashier's hands. Cashiers were generally understaffed, which caused the customers to get mad.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Owasso, OK",5/9/17,2017,5,9

"Great people, poor management","You have the opportunity to move around the store which is great. Not all of management are great to work with. Some managers could use retraining on people skills and on how to help employees work more efficiently. Hours can drastically vary. I went from 40 hours solid to now between 28-32 hours. I enjoy my coworkers as Walmart generally hires great people, it is management and customers who tear us down and make it harder to work.",3,Current Employee,PHARMACY ASSOCIATE ,South Carolina,5/9/17,2017,5,9

Fun when co workers are nice other wise lots of drama,"As a high school student, it was great to work in a place that had extremely flexible hours and an unlimited number of vacation days, however, about a month before I left they implemented the new PTO (Paid Time Off) system that did limit the number of vacation and sick days and required you to work something like 60 hours to get 1 day of PTO (Not 100% sure, it was a while ago and I wasn't really paying attention but I remember the number was ridiculously high for only 1 day).

A Typical Day at Work,"A typical day is ringing up about 800+ customers on an 8 hour basis with two 15-minute breaks and an hour lunch in between. The Customer Service Managers (CSM's) are the friendliest people there and really do the best they can for us cashiers while dealing with their managers constantly barking orders at them as well as with upset customers. The best part of working there is that since it's a relatively small store, everyone knows everyone so we are all indeed a family. The worst part would probably be that there are too many people that come and go without getting the full experience of really working at Wal-Mart.

Ok job with very good benefits,"Always busy.  They expect you to constantly be busy doing some type of work; no standing around and talking.  They say they are trying to make the work/live more balanced.  I am not sure of that. If you want or need a 2nd job, it is very hard to match it with your schedule.

my exp with 10+ yrs at walmart,"my review of walmart come from 4 times working there at 3 different locations, two supercenters ands one neighborhood market, over all a good starting job for the young but it takes years of waiting for promotions or store tranfers and even department tranfers, no overtime and not enough management support for associates to complete tasks",3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Tulsa, OK",5/8/17,2017,5,8

Management will point fingers instead of assist.,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Palmetto, FL",5/8/17,2017,5,8
Stressful and untrained,"There is little to no training for any positions in the management field if you are not becoming an assistant manager. The store I work/worked for is/was the bottom store of the market and even though I was brought on from outside the company into management  they acted as though I should know everything Walmart related.The lack of training, the constant failure of the upper management team to put out effective schedules, and the pressure the upper management puts on the entry level to work around their short comings makes Walmart, or at least store 5654 the bottom of my recommended places to work.",2,Current Employee,Support Manager ,"Tampa, FL",5/8/17,2017,5,8

Walmart was a fast paced and energetic workplace,"In the beginning Walmart was very fast paced, you had better take notes and you better keep up. I learned from day 1, there was no time to take notes, and to drink more coffee, if there was time. No one came to work with one cup, it was a 4-pak to share.Seriously. Walmart provided a coffee pot and weak coffee, a break room, and expected a friendly environment, and it was. The job provided step 1 through step 10 and only 7 associates to do it, and it got done. 24/7, it got done. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the remodel store part, the last store was on the big island of Hawaii, and we were there for almost three months. Three girls in a 2 bedroom house, with a view to DIE FOR!! We had 2 rental cars and weekends off !! You gotta LOVE the HAWAIIAN people!

The store manager is fair to the employees but the management under him doesn't even know his employees that have been there 15-20+ years and doesn't treat them fair. The hardest part of the job was having too many customers at once waiting on you and you're the only one on the floor.

My opinion about Wal-Mart,"I learned many different things from working at Wal-Mart, this is the place that I learned most of my job experience.

I for one always valued that because I too believe that everyone is equal in this world and should been treated as such.. The hardest part about the job, I would not be able to say because everything became so natural and easy for me.Giving each customer the best experience possible was what brought me to work everyday, to me it was making a change.

Enjoyed working with the public. Met some amazing people.,Typically everyday as a cashier i would provide excellent customer service.  I'd do my best to make sure the customer enjoyed their visit to the store.  Monetary transactions was also a big part of being a cashier.  Making sure all transactions were done correctly so that my drawer wasn't over or under.  As a produce associate i made sure all produce on the sales floor wasn't expired. i also had to bring produce from the back room to the sales floor so customers can purchase them.  During the holiday season i was asked to work layaway.  During that time i learned how to do layaway transactions and i learned how to use the palm-pilot   Workplace culture was very calm at times and other times it can be very hectic.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with some customers.  Some were difficult to deal with.  With that being said i also loved the customers they were also my favorite part of the job.

A very frustrating place to work,"Walmart has adopted the management strategy of pressuring employees to get work done within shift time no matter the size of task. However, they are cutting their number of employees working in their stores to bring down operation costs. This creates a skeleton crew which has to do the work of two or sometimes three associates making it impossible to meet time requirements to get merchandise on the floor. It also creates poor customer service and frustrated shoppers. Workplace culture has deteriorated over the years and morale is low. The hardest part was meeting the managements impossible standards. Most enjoyable part was working with a crew that had pride in their work and faith in the company. And being there to help the customers. This review may not apply to all stores, just the four I have work in as an associate and later as a vendor visiting these stores.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager/Cashier ,"Centerville, OH",5/3/17,2017,5,3

A typical day at work was helping people find what they needed, allthewhile keeping in mind their needs, as opposed to wants, and the money they were spending. I actually learned a lot about dealing with the public and politely guiding, or, correcting them in a nice manner. Management and I developed a relationship that I felt was very profitable for all parties involved. Culture, well, most probably compatible to most very large retail outlets. The hardest part about the job was most probably having to give a customer assistance and information and finding they could not totally grasp the meaning. The most enjoyable part of the job was binding with fellow employees, and for the most part, the clients.

A great place to work if you need a good paycheck,"Walmart is a great place to work if you need a good paycheck and something to have until you start your career. Its easy to work your way up and advance as well, however every job has their flaws and I believe the flaws at Walmart is that home office forgets that their employees have personal lives and sometimes things happen. Their occurrence roll over policy is too strict and its one of the main reasons they have such a huge turn over. Also their upper management needs work and improvement. Other than that I would still recommend part timers to try Walmart out since they are a good place for a part time job. However, if you have a hard time with having management constantly breathing down your neck and expecting way more then what you are capable of then it might not be the place for you as it can be quite stressful and demanding.",4,Former Employee,Home Associate/ Toys Associate ,"Cumming, GA",5/3/17,2017,5,3

I got the hang of working, but it took some time, because I had to get used to the heat and not coming inside the store unless it was any of my breaks. I learned that even in the most difficult situations, you have to pull through with all you have to be successful, you should never doubt yourself.

"Retail, what to expect","Walmart's biggest issue is they do not value u their people. If you work hard you get to work even harder to pick up the slack of those around you, inconsistent expectations and standards from each manager and they vary from person to person. It seems more times than not they promote the least qualified person to higher positions in store. Pay is low, if you do make anything over minmum wage they expect you to work yourself to the bone for that small amount. Doing anything above and beyond your job title will lead to you doing that item always. My time at Walmart I found myself doing the job of many department managers and even assistant managers when I was merely a sales associate. I was naive enough to believe they were gonna promote me even tho I saw plenty of persons hired after me that were far less qualified in terms of experience or performance move up I continued to do such extra work until I left Walmart still only a sales associate after 5 yrs. My advice if you are a worker with strong work ethic stay away Walmart will exploit you to the fullest extent.",2,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Colton, CA",5/2/17,2017,5,2

Interesting Job,My typical day working at Walmart was just ringing people up. I stood at a register and that's all I did for hours. I learned how to use a register and have good customer service skills. Management at Walmart didn't want to hear your input on things. It was either their way or no way. I didn't like that. The hardest part about my job was standing in one spot for hours at a time. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the many friendly customers.,2,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Dyersburg, TN",5/1/17,2017,5,1

Walmart has work to do improving opportunities.,"In the past, Walmart has strived harder to be a better company to work for. I feel that has fallen by the wayside. The company has been systematically eliminating upper paygrades from its hourly job tiers for more than 5 years now. There are not nearly as many choices or opportunities there once were. Attendance and scheduling policies make it very difficult if you have a family. There are too many people working for the company that are stuck at part time that want to be full. Walmart has very bright hard-working people working for them, they just need to get serious about keeping them.",2,Former Employee,Invoice Clerk ,"Travelers Rest, SC",5/1/17,2017,5,1

Employees mistreated,"They treat their employees badly. It is bad enough that customers treat employees bad, but the managers did it as well. I was an cashier there. My other employees (cashiers) and I were never told that we had to get credit cards apps from customers. All we could do is ask right? So we asked. Majority already have Walmart credit cards and some didn't even want one (which is understandable because I don't ever want one neither). We must get a number of credit cards apps a day. The managers would houndge over us until we get them.

Not Very good for Teamwork.,Nobody has a sense of teamwork. Policies arent written out so that it is easy to work with one another or get things done efficiently. You backtrack a million times a day before you get things right. And then the policy will change.

Chaos,"Well, to begin, I can say that having worked in a similar place before, I'd have to say the management was much better. At the previous similar business, there were people in management who let their titles go to their heads. That wasn't a problem here. However, by contrast, if the other place was short-handed, the person in charge would look over the schedule, see who wasn't in danger of exceeding 40 hours for the week, and call someone in (or try to). At Wal-Mart, they would just take someone from another department, which only leaves the original department short-handed. Seems like poor planning.",2,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Saginaw, MI",5/1/17,2017,5,1

Decent pay but stressful work environment,"I have worked at Wal-Mart for over 2 years altogether. The ability to advance is a small chance. Customer service jobs are busy, and there are many days when employees have to handle conflict situations with customers while still maintaining store policy. Management is hard on all employees.

Extremely stressful with limited understanding/support from managers,"When I started working for Walmart it was awesome!  I had a 30 paid lunch and two 15 min. breaks (our store actually took this time all at once , 1 whole hour).  I was paid a very nice salary and my input and knowledge was respected and sought after.  There was plenty of time to develop relationships with our patients and conduct clinical services, such as MTM and vaccines.  _x000D__x000D_We now have a  district manager that cares more for numbers than for patient safety, supporting clinical services properly, and the overall happiness and well being of our RPHs and technicians.  Our sales/tech and rph hours have now been slashed and our responsiblities have only increased.  The expectation now is that an RPH has to stay until all the day's work is done, no matter how many staff members call off or what may occur.  This often means working after scheduled shifts for free, which I don't think is ethical or legal.  Many Rph's have elected to skip their breaks in a attempt to work more so that they actually may be able to leave on time and have a life outside of work.  Yes its getting very bad indeed and many RPH's are now looking for ways to get out.   Looking more like CVS everyday unfortunately.",3,Current Employee,Pharmacist ,Ohio,4/29/17,2017,4,29

The trainers showed me the environment of the workplace before hand and experienced workers mentored me before sending me off on my own, so that once I began work I was a skillful worker prepared to advance and contribute to bettering the environment. Management was kind and helpful when I needed help and always kept me doing my best, and although there was a slight issue with clear scheduling or contact availability they were always there on site at the workplace. The customers and staff alike were people with a variety of personalities and backgrounds, and I learned more about the people in my community by experiencing the nature of all types of personality.

"Reliable and secure workplace, management frequently unreliable, profound environment","A typical day at work can be slightly hectic but still peacefully maintained by insuring proper work technique and demonstrating excellent customer service. Working at Wal-Mart I've learned that communication is a key ingredient to a successful and productive day on the job; you get out what you put in. I've also come to learn that the management is exceptionally fair but slightly unreliable at times. The co-workers are probably the best part of the job, everybody knows everybody and we help each other get through the day. While every job has its perks, it also comes with some down-side. One of the only things I would consider to be a downside when it comes to being employed at Wal-Mart would be the constant struggle to maintain excellent work production while staying within the strict rules/guidelines.",3,Current Employee,Meat Department Associate ,"Ponchatoula, LA",4/28/17,2017,4,28

No longer associate friendly more about how much money we can make,I have been an assistant manager for Walmart for 13 years prior to that I was with them 6 years I actually met Sam Walton and since his passing it has been non associate friendly and in reference to the associate said when there are visitors coming yes they go into panic mode and the bad thing about it we know when they're coming so it's really no surprise so we ask Associates to work extra for that visit and then we ask them to cut their time later on at the end of the week is that fair I think not,1,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,Frisco Texas,4/28/17,2017,4,28

Horrible.,"I hated this job. My work associates were great and I made friends, but the job itself was horrible. As a cashier you deal with a lot of stress and when you need a manager you have to flash your light and wait as the customer takes their anger out on you and the manger takes their sweet time getting to you. _x000D_Also you only get 10% employee discount that you can't use on food.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Ocoee, FL",4/28/17,2017,4,28

"great place to work if just starting out, good for college students. Nice atmosphere to work with other people.","Starting out, seemed to be and was a great place to work. Times change and so do companies. Worked both overnight and day shifts in my many years of employment. Basically controlling inventory and making sales was the biggest responsibility. Doing these things by hand, such as stocking shelves and keeping overstock at a minimum, but being sure to have enough to fill the sales floor. Management here changed quite often, you get some that drill you constantly and some that will work with you. Those that worked with me normally stayed around longer, others not so much. The hardest part of the job was trying to listen to assignments by more than one boss, knowing that there isn't enough time to please all of them.I liked the atmosphere and people I worked with mostly, some became like almost family. The physicality of the job was demanding but reasonable. Pay rate could have been better for people with a lot of years of seniority. Management over the years I would have to grade at a C. Too many changes, in a short period of time for management I feel isn't a good thing. But I do understand the want or need to move up in a company, and this was a fast paced company for managers to come and go. I',ve seen it affect both customers and associates.",3,Former Employee,ICS Associate ,"Walpole, MA",4/28/17,2017,4,28
typical workday,"my typical work day would be taking the course on the computer, then going in to check the customers items. I learned how to ring up customers items, providing customer service. The management is not too bad I guess I can say on  my part the one only thing I had an issue was to change my schedule for the reason being that it was hard to get off from work. no buses run in area and I didn't have any source of income to help me get home after I get off, they didn't understand, or was willing to try to change my schedule so I can make it to work. the job isn't hard just trying to remember what you learned and to apply it to the customers. the most part that is enjoyable is enteracting with customers.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Union, NJ",4/28/17,2017,4,28

Fun place if you are in the right team.,"Typical day is like working for other corporate america corporation where you are required to work but for more than regular 8 hour work day. If you are in the right group, you could learn very much since technology is not an issue. There is this mentor system that translates to how you know.

Good place to work,Felder Service is a good place to work especially if you like working with older people. A typical day at work will go great but its like all the time you have to work by yourself and you will have other team members around. I've learned no matter what go on keep your job going. Management was bad. She showed a lot of favoritism toward certain workers. The workplace culture was very slow and relaxed. The most enjoyable part about this job is working with the elderly.,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Montgomery, AL",4/28/17,2017,4,28

use only as a stepping stone find a better job within 2 years of employment,"There is culture of favoritism,  Your work ethics mean nothing.  The company is becoming more stringent about salary increases and absences. Employee's actually save their sick time (now PTO) to cover mandatory hour reductions in January thru March.  The current raise in salary came with a reduction of hours. Management is unrealistic about the time required to complete any tasks assigned. Employee knowledge about product or product placement is not encouraged or even required until an employee becomes a manager._x000D_The average customer is frustrated by the lack of knowledge by the employee and then becomes angry.

Super High Production. High turnover rate. High rate of injury,Production was over 1400 boxes and hour over a 12 hour shift. 0 leway is given. If you are 1% short you get written up. Terrible on your body. I was 19 at the time and had to do general physical therapy for my body when i left.,3,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Loveland, CO",4/28/17,2017,4,28
Unorganized with no care for employees,Any benefits you work to get can be removed with little to no warning such as being left without insurance. None of the store's sections are staffed properly so the day is spent funneling employees to the registers and leaving the few on the floor with a far increased work load. Management is only seen when they need to point out any flaws spotted then they return to the back office. When management assures seasonal employees that they will be rehired after the season no one gets called back. So banking on the assurance of a rehire you're suddenly out of a job.,2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Dallas, GA",4/28/17,2017,4,28

Used to be a great company,"I no longer support the idea that this is the greatest company in America-or the world.  It is a behemoth beast that no longer cares about long term associates and experience. When Mr Sam was alive, it was the greatest place to work about 15 to 20 years ago!  It only takes one CEO to ruin a good thing, and that certainly was the case here-and I was working there the entire time of the expansion and great Supercenter explosion. They cannibalized themselves to the point of no return and ended up closing stores-some nearly brand new a couple years ago.  The nice benefits were little by little eliminated or reduced and the healthcare choices for the largest company in the world were high deductibles and expensive plans.  I enjoyed all but the last 18 months there.  It got to be a hostile work environment and the long term associates were let go in favor of temporary workers who were not offered any benefits at all. Bad management and a lack of respect was rampant. I wouldn't even recommend it to teens as a first job now.  Many other choices where all people are treated better. A door greeter in WI was recently fired for not keeping a turkey out of the store. Even older people are not respected at this company anymore.",1,Former Employee,Department Manager ,Wisconsin,4/27/17,2017,4,27

Walmart is a good place to work if you are willing to put the effort forward,"Walmart has very good training program.  Either by computer, DVD, or hands on.  Management is available to help resolve problems that may occur with customer or day to day operations. With Walmart they have 24 HRS to get back to you with answer or at least what is being done to resolve the situation.  What makes the job is the team work, that is part of Walmarts creed. Their is always someone available to help in a situation. The hardest part is probably the many changes in inventory.  Trying keep a customer happy when a product they use to use is no longer available.  But it's a pleasure when you can satisfy them with a product that replaces the one that is no longer carried.  Just putting a smile on a customers face makes the whole day worth while.

The co worker Is great.It was my first job, it was a good one to start with, people are nice and helpful, and the work was satisfying. Management could be pretty lax so long as you were doing your job or showing that you were doing your best.

Not the best job to have,"My time working at Walmart was interesting. The managers were not so nice. They expected you to ask no questions and to know everything, and it just makes you want to figure out everything on your own instead of asking for help. It can be a great learning tool but also a curse depending on the situation. The pay was.. okay. Being a self checkout host isn't as easy as it seems. Monitoring four different registers as well as taking customers on the register in the front could get nerve wrecking, but it is very easy to do once you get the hang of it! Especially if you are a quick learner! The only problem is that there were some problems that I could not fix because I wasnt qualified to, and I would have to wait on a manager to come down and help. Sometimes it took forever which caused problems with some customers who were a bit impatient. Overall, working at Walmart was a fun experience. Getting to know your co-workers who have been there and basically know all there is to know can be a big help, and can contribute to you not having to ask your managers so many question as well as making your day more exciting!",3,Former Employee,Self Checkout Host ,"Savannah, GA",4/27/17,2017,4,27

bad work environment,The best thing would be the hours but that is if you are full time. But the pay could be way better for the work that they want you to do and the task they ask you to perform. Some management were very helpful but most only cared about themselves. The attendance policy is horrible for people who have families and young children.

The management was awesome they made sure everything was up to par as far as staff and customers. The workplace culture was actually getting together it was a new store so things were actually falling into place. The hardest part of my job was when I first started I couldn't find the places where certain things were placed. A little help from the management I got easy to me.

Retail life at walmart,"Walmart, one of the biggest companies known worldwide. From the outside, things look fine but what's within this giant company is a bit of a mess. _x000D_    From the terrible lack of communication to the ever slight training, Walmart is honestly a mixed bag and is hard to review because of their philosophy. They try to keep all the stores similar, but as anybody would assume, each store is ran differently while still trying to hold firm to their overall beliefs. Having been to five different stores in my ten year tenure, I can firmly say that you need to find the right store that works for you._x000D_    With plenty of job opportunities to promote and above average incentives and coverages, you can easily make Walmart into a career, but at what costs? Are you willing to brown nose? Can you keep up with the changing of ideas every year? Can you come in to work your hardest without a single bit of appreciation? While some stores are ran that way, there are others that actually go out looking for those ""hard workers"" who are easy to train, willing to learn and want to be taken under someone's wing for further development into hopefully a higher position, but are you going to be in the right store that fits your needs and expectations?",4,Former Employee,Inventory Supervisor ,"Bowling Green, OH",4/26/17,2017,4,26

"Productive, social, dramatic, childish, fun, and inconsistent.","Many of my bosses brought their own issues into work and gave instantaneous attitudes when simple solutions were at hand. ""Panic Managment"", made doing work stressful. Management needs to plan ahead with their associates to prevent last minute chaos. Too many arguments, too many egos. Overnight managers were lenient, kind, and fun. Overnight managers also seemed more successful than day-time managers and even the co-managers. The best parts of the job are always assisting customers and good team performance.

Decent place to work,Walmart is an okay place to work.They supply you with benefits and a pay raise after 6 months. The only complaint I ever had was with training.

Because that was not supplied for me.,5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Wichita, KS",4/26/17,2017,4,26

Eeeehhh...,"From what I hear, it depends on the center. My own center said they would hire you for full time but barely give you even 20 hours a week. This would be an okay job for those who need a second job to the side- though, be careful. Clocking in one minute late is grounds for you to be fired. I didn't very much enjoy my job, it wasn't overly stressful or anything just wasn't my cup of tea. They have an open-door policy, which is nice, and for the most part my managers were understanding and helpful. It gets slow and boring sometimes, and standing in one spot is bad on the feet.

We spent the entire year, including Black Friday severely understaffed. At a certain point, there was no room to cut non-contributing employees so it became commonplace for employees to avoid coming to work on labor-intensive days without penalty.

The way we were managed was kinda...lazy. Like our store manager would wait until the day the district manager to come to be strict on the rules.

The CSMs were very quick and helpful, and they usually were on the ball with busy days._x000D__x000D_In both areas, management was apprehensive to ""share"" employees on average days when one department/area needed more help. Cashiers were only doled out one at a time to the places closest to the register. Sales associates hardly ever jumped departments. This might be due to lack of training. The slew of computer-based training modules are fine for learning the basics, but in my year as a floor worker, I never learned how to take things out of the back for customers to buy. Management was quick to pass the training to people of the same level who had just been employed longer instead of having some kind of ""how to do"" paper or FAQ for the department.",3,Former Employee,Cashier and Sales Associate ,"Rolla, MO",4/24/17,2017,4,24

"Good job, but not a career for me.","Walmart is an interesting place to work. The job itself is fairly fast paced and physically demanding, but I have enjoyed working with most of the people here. I have developed an incredible value for customer service and work ethics. However, in my opinion, the main complaint about the place is that there are are way too many chiefs and too few indians. For every department, there are about 5-7 managers that I interact with on a daily basis. Many of which are not on the same page with things and their requests are trumped in ascending managerial order, so you work on one thing, and another manager will ask you to do something different and so on. it can get frustrating at times! The most enjoyable part of the job is that I have the opportunity to interact with customers all day long and get to share little parts of their lives each time they come into my store.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Conway, AR",4/23/17,2017,4,23

"Great coworkers, great hours","I loved working here and would gladly work for Walmart again. I used to be under Walmart's CAP team 2, unloading trucks daily and stacking the freight onto pallets, stocking grocery aisles, taking pallets of freight to the floor. There, I learned how to use a pallet jack, how to stock and stack boxes efficiently, and general work ethics, being my first job. Management sometimes made life a little rough, but we always got what we needed done and felt good about it after we went home. Workplace culture, very White and Hispanic/Latino heavy. Hardest part of the job was when management was feeling moody, they'd assign us to a useless task when there was work to be done and we'd fall behind and really need to pick the pace up. Most enjoyable part of the job was feeling satisfied with myself and actually happy when I went home, exhausted and sore but looking forward to doing it again.",4,Former Employee,Cap team 2 ,"Yelm, WA",4/23/17,2017,4,23
good as a stepping stone job.,Walmart is a good stepping stone job if you are between jobs. The company needs to take care of their employees better. Their benefits packages need to be better. They will hire you full time and only give you part time hours. They need to take care of their hourly managers better. A Customer Service Manager should not make less than a new cashier coming in the door.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Customer Service Manager ,"Greensboro, NC",4/23/17,2017,4,23
Horrible Management,"Lazy and rude managers. All of the management there is aware of people stealing company time and they those workers get away with it. Some managers remove points from workers records because it would hurt that department if those people would be fired because we have a horrible turn over rate. Lazy co- workers and when you tell management about those horrible workers they do absolutely nothing to make them work. There's favoritism. Extra breaks being taken and management is aware of it. Some management won't even look you in the eye when you're talking to them or they try to speed up the conversation by saying ""yeah"" or ""okay"", they'll even be on their cell phones when trying to talk to them. There is an open door policy at Walmart and managers have told workers before when they have needed help or questions that they ""don't have to time for this/you"" Some managers sit in  a back office and do nothing just to hide from their workers that they're supposed to be there for when needed. I would never recommend anyone to work at the Shepherdsville Walmart. It is a complete nightmare.",1,Current Employee,Sale Associate ,"Shepherdsville, KY",4/23/17,2017,4,23

Walmart,.The company has great opportunities. I feel the way of teaching and training management team is not what it should be.

Great people to work with other than the management,"Only negative thing I have to say about working for Walmart is the confusion that the management provides. You have many people that can tell you what to do and you have to do everything that everyone of them says to do. It gets very difficult to do so when at least two different managers each tell you to do something at the same time. Typical day at work would include unloading the products onto the shelves, zoning the products, and anything else that my bosses would tell me to do. Met many great employees there and befriended most of them. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers out. I love helping someone out and knowing that I made their day that much better.",3,Former Employee,Grocery Sales Associate & Receiving Associate ,"Russellville, AR",4/21/17,2017,4,21

It all depends on the stores location and management,I primarily worked at the same location every day but there were 2 nearby stores that I was also sent to to help hen needed. Everything about working there depended on the stores location and its management team. A good location with a good management team generally resulted in a good team of employees and a very pleasant work experience. On the other hand some stores had a very poor management team that would usually result in a disorganized store with a lot of missing stock caused both by the employees not doing their jobs correctly and theft that was both not stopped and not being properly accounted for. In my experience it was either a pleasure to work at a location or you dreaded going to work on a daily basis.,3,Former Employee,Inventory Management ,"Gladstone, MO",4/20/17,2017,4,20

Awful place unless it is a stepping stone up,"Don't expect to really go anywhere if you work at Walmart. The pay is awful and the management only care if they have their own days off.

"Great experience for first time retail job, but I'll never work at Walmart again","In this position at Walmart, I learned that if you're really good at your job, management expects you to do 4 other people's jobs at the same time while also trying to maintain your own. There was definitely favoritism and unfair treatment in regards to how some of the managers viewed certain employees. Benefits and breaks were provided. Normally taking vacation wasn't a problem, but during the holidays it was war for everyone who worked in a high demand area; ie. toys, electronics, photo center, etc. I definitely didn't expect to make as many friends working there as I did, but it just shows that there are all walks of life coming in and out of positions there as well as the customers.",2,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Coventry, RI",4/20/17,2017,4,20
fun but stressful workplace,"A typical day at work was good. there were lots of customers, it was always busy, which was great because there was always something to do. I learned how to look up customer receipts, how to do wire transfers, money orders,and how to cash checks. I also learned how to mange the front end of the store. The management wasn't that bad it was just hard getting them to come and talk to the customers and there was a lot of favoritism. The workplace was very unorganized but one belief that they have that was good is Respect for the Individual. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the favoritism from the management. The most enjoyable part was being able to help the customers and doing it with a smile.",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Landover Hills, MD",4/20/17,2017,4,20
Has been a long time sense I work there,Long time sense I have worked for Walmart  I Honestly couldn't tell you much about them now but when I was there I did enjoy the job. I only left because I had gotten my old job back and made much more money at my old job. I would have stay with them if didn't get offered my old job back,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Casa Grande, AZ",4/20/17,2017,4,20

Low Pay and Bad Work Environment,"Unfortunately at the store I worked in, the management staff had a double standard of dealing with employees. The employee's they like were given lots of leeway while those that they did not like were treated like slaves. For example, when stocking in a particular area the computer only gives the employee a certain amount of time to complete the nights' tasks for those employees who were liked these times were never applied. However, employees who were disliked were held to the times, and if they did not meet these times, they were written up and eventually terminated.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Waynesville, NC",4/20/17,2017,4,20
Okay place to work,"Great benefits. Can apply for 401k, Walmart stock and my share profits which are paid out quarterly. Flexible hours and fair management. Looks great on the resume.

Not a nice place to work,"They have a set schedule and most of the employees are nice to talk to, and they have a really nice pay. They also have a good hour lunch if you work a certain number of hours. However the management was awful. They don't care about any of their employees, their benefits were horrible, and they do nothing when there are managers abusing their power and mistreating their employees. It is a terrible place to work.",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Bangor, ME",4/20/17,2017,4,20
"Really enjoyed being a cashier, great customer experience","I worked part-time, enjoyed the customer experience, had a very good relationship with fellow employees.

Enjoyable fun work place.,"typical day at work is relaxing, usually busy but not stressful. I learned how to work the register and that's something everyone should learn while working there because when it gets busy cashiers have more help when short staffed. Management is great! The only tough thing about working there is the customers but, every customer is different. most day are enjoyable and its rare to have a bad day, you meet a lot of great people while working there that they almost feel like family. You pick up new ideas on how to deal with things such as time management, multitasking, dealing with problems, and other learning experience's. Enjoyable part of the job is when you really get into your work and the time fly's by, its like you weren't working for long because of how focused you are. Everyone is really nice there and easy to get along with.",5,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Redding, CA",4/20/17,2017,4,20
Poor Management,"People are fairly decent around Walmart but the management is poor. They are always reactive, rude, they disrespect you and belittle you instead of helping you and try to help you grow with the company. The store manager is the worse in this as he will shoot down request to transfer or even advance in the company. Many people have had to leave the store in secret in order to actually begin to get ahead.",2,Current Employee,Walmart unloader ,"Battle Creek, MI",4/20/17,2017,4,20

"Fast pace, customer friendly atmosphere.","Make sure front end of store was zone properly, make sure all cashier were dressed in the proper work attire, make sure that the outside of the store was clean and carts were available for the customer. I learned how to use several inventory devices, how to count down each register and proper way to collect each cashiers moneys. Management could've used more classes on how to approach others but  overall good staff. Hardest part of the job was counting on other employees to show up for work, while the most enjoyable part was helping customers with issues.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Marietta, GA",4/20/17,2017,4,20
The Night of Living Overnight Modular Associate,"2 1/2 years of Retail was life changing, a constant work everyday. I learned that you should stay business 24/7.

productive fun workplace with great co-workers,I always came in happy to see my co-workers and to do my job successfully. The coworkers are what help the day go by.

Ideally for the person who wants to pick up some extra money,"Walmart is not designed to be a career but is simply just a job to tie  one over who is between jobs or would like to pick up some extra money.  Expect part time work only.  Managers are less likely to respect you however it is not entirely unheard of to get that boss that acts more friend than employer.

I helped unload and move pallets. I searched for products to be put out from the freezer. I also cleaned the cooler by myself and cleaned milk trays that resided under the milk areas.

"Fun place to work, needed more equipment to help","I loved working with the other employees, but mostly liked interacting with the customers and helping them find things, or answering questions.  Nothing was really hard to do, just wish they would let you stay in your department(s) and feel like you accomplished something while you are there.

Stressful and inconsistent work expectations.,Wal-Mart holds a standard for its employees. However that standard is not equal among all of its employees. The company tends to put more pressure on harder working ore reliable associates. But that being said it does not seem fair or just to leave less productive or focused associates to their own devices while focusing on pushing the already hardworking and dedicated employees more and more. Also they do not consider effort or qualification when giving pay raises or compensation they use a time based system where whoever has been there the longest regardless of ability or worth should get paid the most.,3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Honesdale, PA",4/20/17,2017,4,20
Poor management talk,Walmart is a big fat lie. they tell you there is place to grow in at Walmart but there really isn't. you can work so hard to try a different area and they end up hiring someone else for that position you were working for. i know an employee who had that happen to twice. walmart is a joke .,1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Evans Mills, NY",4/20/17,2017,4,20
Amazing company,I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart and left only to make more money. The management knew what they were doing and never had to worry about layoffs or being sent home early. The benefits were great other then having to wait for a year to be eligible for them due to being part time. They help with emergency moves as well as helping you pay for college.

The people were fun to work with but the managers would punish the good workers for the things the bad workers would do.,I would normally start off my day by pushing carts. Then when it got busy inside the store. I would be brought in and put on a register. It was my first time working in retail so I learned a lot about customers and customer service. The management was never on top of things like they convinced you they were when I got hired. I'd have to do there jobs on more then one occasion to like helping associates and reporting to the boss when people would break the company guidelines. Everyone knew everyone and it was very enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was working my whole shift in the freezing cold.

Ok place,Your told you're part time if your a sales associate but they give you hours like your full time. A typical work day is 8 hours and every now and then a 4.5 day. On average you receive 32 hours a week only if the store isn't packed you'll receive lesser than that which is rare. Good luck  getting  closed availability which is asking to work from a certain time and staying to a certain time for school or personnel obligations. Sometimes you might get closed availability then a manager will override it and make you start earlier or stay later than what you can. Expect long days and overtime for inventory. Can get short staffed a lot and expect fellow coworkers to take long breaks or call in a lot without any repercussions. And having to work elsewhere besides your department.

Depends on what kind of person you are really???,A typical day at Walmart is usually really busy and exhausting. You do get an abundance of customers along with your daily tasks that you need to do for that particular department. They are very good at letting you go on breaks along with lunch if you work more than a 5 hour shift. You can work up to 36 hours part time and 40 full time. It's difficult to become full time. Walmart loves to send you to different departments all the time and get you knowledged up with everything to use you as a tool in the store.

Getting our work area set up and utilizing the pallet jacks was really fun especially when the boxes were stacked really high and they would waver back and forth through the aisles.  The shift went by so quickly some nights with us setting goals on how many pallets we would complete that shift.  Two of us managed to get 10 loaded pallets finished.  We would first sort the entire pallet and put everything into carts and then we would spend the other half of the shift unloading the carts and putting the products into their proper places.  It was physically demanding at times but helped me get back into shape fast.  Our lunch breaks were a little too long causing tiredness to set in.

I love helping people. Unfortunately, Walmart is making a lot of company changes that make it hard for people to work there and have a family life, or any life outside of work. I am a single parent. I do not have 24 hr availability to work. Trying to get the people at Walmart to understand that is impossible. Associates are tools to be used, not people with families, opinions or feelings.

productive retail store,A typical day at work was performing overrides and register drops. I learned that in a managerial role you have to respect and teach associates that were below you.

A challenging yet friendly workplace,"Walmart is an exacting employer who wants to make sure everything is done right. This is not always accomplished however. The store is usually understaffed with myself pulling double duty as a cart pusher for an hour because the only one on staff that day has to go to lunch. This happens on a weekly basis. I am one of only two maintenance associates on the entirety of the day shift. Two days a week I am on my own entirely. We are also under supplied constantly running out of paper towels to stock the store restrooms. My hours and days vary from week to week with no one seeming to check which days you worked the week before which at one point had me working six days straight. Despite all this the pay is good and the employees (or associates as we're called) are open and friendly, often going out of their way to help.",2,Current Employee,Maintenance Worker ,"Carrollton, KY",4/13/17,2017,4,13

So so,"Selection is good when they can stay in stock. This store does a tremendous volume of sales, but keep cutting the labor force and their hours,  and making them do more.

The management really need to work on their business model, like taking better care of their employees, so they, in turn, care about the store.",5,Former Employee,Associate ,"Paris, TX",4/13/17,2017,4,13
High expectations from employees,"I unloaded freight from trucks. We separated items onto pallets depending on what department they belonged in. This took several hours.

Confused why I wasted so much of my life there.,"Even for those not seeking anything in life beyond a job at walmart, I can't recommend working there. Boss, upon boss, upon boss does not care. Every time you express concern and confide, the one higher up squashes the one below, hence bottom level stays squashed. _x000D__x000D_The job itself was OK. It was the politics and ridiculousness provided by the workforce (both salaried and hourly) that made the job undesirable. _x000D__x000D_They protect the bad workers and punish the good workers.

Terrible Employer,Management is not very interactive with employees.  Employees' schedules constantly changed without the employees' prior consent and/or knowledge.

over-nights,"Working the over-night shift is not an easy job,  once you get used to working hard and fast it can be a nice place to work.  Down side is the over-night shift has the least amount of workers and have to do twice the amount of work.  The more you know how to do in each department, the better your chances to be taken full-time. The best part of the job is meeting new people and making friends.  The downside of the job is, they are so short staffed,  that you are very worn out at the end of the shift.",4,Former Employee,FDD Stocker ,"Houston, MO",4/13/17,2017,4,13

Safety is very important but maybe ignored by store manager. Employees may care for each other but the Walmart Culture has changed and is uncaring. They want to replace all full timers with part timers. less benifits more hours worked for less costs._x000D__x000D_generally the only real family at Walmart is the Walton family, the employees are a dime a dozen and as easy to replace.",2,Former Employee,OVERNIGHT STOCKER ,"Franklin, NJ",4/12/17,2017,4,12

Good Pay but Not Worth the Stress,"I worked here for a little over a year and though I found the pay to be better than most companies and it paid my bills, the stress that came with the job was not worth it in my opinion.

Walmart is full of false hopes,"For a company with a profit of over 400 billion, they are not willing to promote and advance within the company. It's a shame. I invested 8 years of my life with Walmart and was constantly looked over as a pharmacy employee.

Some of the managers would stuck me and everything that wasn't done they blamed on me even though I had coworkers that could have done what they wanted. they even yelled at me for things going bad in my department while I was on lunch.

We were recently forced to to work 3-12 hour shifts instead of 4-10's, so our hours are cut to 36 a week instead of 40 with zero premium change. So we're asked to work longer, harder hours for less pay. The company has spiraled out of control the last 4-5 years.

attitude is everything,"The nighttime management has a great attitude. The nighttime associates, however, are an 80/20 split. 80 percent are mopey and always in a bad mood where 20 percent have an upbeat attitude. It is very hard to work with the negative people so your personal attitude is everything.It is also hard to get used to working nights. Your body and mind aren't programmed that way. Its also difficult to do your job properly in maintenance when you don't have all the supplies you need. We let management know we are completely out of something and it takes weeks to get what we need.

Do your work and go home,I don't know about all Walmart's but the one I work at is probably one of the worst ones to be in. My typical day is doing at least three people's jobs on top of unloading anywhere from two to three trucks a day. I've learned from Walmart that if your not a favorite your just a laborer that doesn't get paid enough to speak. The management at my store belong in high school and aren't mature enough to run a store. The hardest part of my job is always doing your best and still looked at like your not good enough.

I decided to try it out for myself when I came of age and immediately regretted it. The management can't work together and instead of being consistent they only really care about everything when a ""big wig"" comes in. I loved my department  and was proud of my work. If the managers cared more about what their employees were doing right instead of berating them every time they slipped up a little maybe they wouldn't lose so many of their good employees.",4,Current Employee,Produce Sales Associate ,"Cleveland, TX",4/10/17,2017,4,10

It's very pleasant with very good compensation for the work performed. You clock in, management tells you what area(s) you'll be working, and depending on what store your working (whether its 24hr or not) you don't have to deal with customers for very long. Clock in, throw some earbuds in and tune out while you get everything done. The job moves really quick so the night passes by quickly.

Great for a first job,"The best part about Wal Mart is their emphasis on building your skills up, especially in your job field. I learned more about inventory management from Wal Mart than a class I took at an employment building. However, once you are really good at what you do, it is likely that they will not promote you to something else. I was satisfied with my position, but this is a word of caution to those who want to move up. Management is a mixed bag, some are great, some are happy to just sit in the office.

Walmart Review,"This company is very well known all over the planet. With it being such a popular houshold name and so famous, it is easy to see them as one of the top businesses in this country and around the world. However thats if we look at the numbers or the larger variety of items/products the super stores offers to its customers over some competitors. In the time i have been working for the company i have learned many good things that will benefit me in my future and have met good friends in the process. Yet i do not see the company as one that i can stay with for a large portion of my life and when it comes to the management i felt very un-connected and unapreciated as an associate for the company. There are far too many individuals who work at walmart who simply do not care and complain about the company on a daily basis, those who lack integrity make it easy to spread negative perspectives on coming in to work everyday. so i find it hard to stay motivated surrounded by such a careless staff. it is not a job i am proud to be apart of and that is exactly what i am searching for a place where the management and associates have pride in what they do and enjoy waking up in the morning to go to work.",1,Current Employee,Assembler ,"Brooksville, FL",4/9/17,2017,4,9

Great people and place to work for.,I enjoyed working at walmart alot. Loved helping customers and trying to make their shopping experience the best ever. I started out as cart associate and 4 months later i was promoted to produce sales associate. I also helped unload the trucks and downstack produce pallets.,4,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,Allen road,4/7/17,2017,4,7
Horrible place to work,"I worked in produce which was very demanding. At our store managers would publicly shame a department by bringing seven managers to ""show us how it's done"". They would pull pallets to the floor (something we weren't allowed to do) and our department had at best two people and a department manager. I had to work alone one Thanksgiving weekend. We had to regularly break safety regulations because we couldn't take pallets t the floor. If you were caught you'd get written up. They only released your schedule three weeks at a time and they wanted associates to commit to 24/7 availability.",1,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",4/7/17,2017,4,7
Work,"Each day has variation. There (to me) is not a thing such as ""a typical day"". One day, you may be tasks with doing the job of others along with yours. On another day, you may be able to focus on your specific routine. At times, expectations are unrealistic and the home office is very out of touch with daily store operations. Overall, the potential the company has is promising, however, there are several people in the wrong positions.",4,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Bentonville, AR",4/7/17,2017,4,7
Good way to build peaople skills,"The company is a well rounded place to work. The benefits are good, the people are amazing, the company shares profits with assoicates.

good starter job,"the job is really good, loved first shift, very friendly coworkers.

Workload unbearable,"About half the people I worked with were worth anything. I had some great managers, but they couldn't do their best because they were being stopped by upper management, e.i. store manager. There were so many chances to do great things that were stopped by higher management. The work load they give you can be ridiculous for one person to bear. Each department should really have a manager then 2 underlings. I know it has changed now, but from what I've heard I'm not sure its for the better.

Great place to work,"Wal-Mart the actually company is a good place to work for. I actually enjoy working for the company. However though, while there is a wide variety of job advancements there, I find it hard for me to advance my position. Wal-Mart has something that's called Cap Team 2, and I am a part of that team. Cap Team 2 is considered to be the heart of Wal-Mart because the team is responsible for setting up the GM Receiving Room, unloading the trucks, and clearing the GM Receiving Room after each use. We're also responsible for cleaning of the truck's trailer and going out to the sales floor to stock grocery items to it's proper place on shelves. Wal-Mart offer the team 38-40 hours a week with no benefits at all! We're part-time workers, and I find it impossible to move up the ladder because Managers love the production their getting from the team. They don't want anybody to move from off the team. It's either you work as a part of Cap 2 Team, or you're out the door. I have been with the company for almost 2 years, and I strongly wish to seek a future with any company I shall work for if I'm going to stay long with them.",4,Current Employee,Grocery Stocker ,"Georgetown, SC",4/7/17,2017,4,7

Possibly A Fair Place to Work,"Walmart is currently in the midst of an internal campaign to change it's company culture in an effort to be a better place to work. I don't know if it will work or not. Your experience could be highly dependent on the management at the store you work for._x000D__x000D_It's a retail business, so you probably won't have the ideal 9 to 5 schedule. That said, I've been working there for a year, and I haven't endured any forced overtime like I have with other retail companies. You can be sure you'll be paid for the time you work, as well._x000D__x000D_The company I worked for before Walmart only put up their schedule 2 to 3 days beforehand, so I appreciate that the schedule at Walmart goes up 3 weeks ahead of time. That gives you the ability to make  plans with people and actually live your life instead of being a captive of the company._x000D__x000D_It's not a perfect place to work, and it is retail, so it has all the pitfalls of retail. Management may lack leadership ability, and it is likely you will often be understaffed. I would have been surprised to say this before, but if you're going to work in retail, this might be one of the better places to work. It's just that it's retail.",3,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"Denver, CO",4/6/17,2017,4,6

Good job with nice co-workers.,"As a cashier I was in a high traffic, busy area for the most part.  People were pleasant to work with and any concerns were handled in a professional manner.  Hardest part of the job wasn't being on my feet but, standing still in one spot for periods of time.  Whenever I was placed in the tobacco shop I was able to move about and walk frequently to retrieve products (which was a challenge for me since I'm a non-smoker and cigarettes are not in alphabetical order).

Great first job to gain work experience,"Working for Walmart was like working for any other entry-level job. As a cashier, a typical day at work is pretty much ringing up customers and processing payment methods, then giving back any change necessary. During the lulls, Customer Service Supervisors (CSS), while working the front end to balance the lines, would give us other jobs to do until it picked up again. These extra jobs usually entailed running go-backs back to their shelves, collecting go-backs from registers and then sorting them into their subsequent bins, or collecting trash and hangers from the registers and disposing of them. More often then not, I enjoyed working for Walmart, but management could do a little better not only typing up schedules, but just all around do a better job of not playing favorites with their employees. The most fun I've had on the job was all the inside jokes my fellow cashiers and I had, and how well we all got along.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Tacoma, WA",4/6/17,2017,4,6

I've managed a couple ladies in how to greet customers, how to file, answer phones, trained in checking guests in and out of hotels. My workplace always had people from the Caribbean which are sometimes English speaking, Spanish, and Creole. The hardest part of the job usually was always making a customer happy. To have a person being upset was not good for business, so I've always went by the rules and knew how to communicate with someone.The most enjoyable part of the job was always being busy and multitasking.

Could be a lot better,I've worked at Wal-mart stores for 4 years and in those 4 years I can say that they do believe in advancing their employees and hiring from within however the starting rate could have been a lot better.

"Good Company, bad management",Work on CAP Team 2 is very physical and the demand during holiday season allows for all the hours you want.  Fellow associates are friendly for the most part.

I worked in the fresh area, so it MIGHT be different in other areas, but based on what co-workers have said, it's not.

"Productive, stressful work environment.","I'd come in and open the deli, begin moving products from the freezers to the sales floor. Would organize and price the products.

I would then work behind the counter, preparing and cooking the products, cutting and packaging meats and cheeses, and finally serving those products per customers requests. I would also come in from time to time to do closing shifts. I would clean and prepare the tools and workplace for the following day. I didn't see management often but the supervisors were pretty strict. Culture seems more business oriented, but seemed family friendly.

hated this job,"Moving from one department to another usually results in a pay cut, depending on where you're transferred, but it's nice that they give you an entire hour for lunch depending, once again, on which department you work in.

It was fun to work there...,"Out of the jobs I had, working at Walmart was the best one. I loved working with the people and helping move merchandise on the shelves. The only criticism I have is that the managers did not talk with one another, which lead to a lot of people getting mixed instructions. Also, I believe strongly that three of the four managers should not have been managers, as they did not treat their employees well, relying on yelling at them in front of customers and threats to get results.

Difficult,"I like working with the people around me, I love the interaction between customers.

The company really tries to help it's employees,  with scheduling and everything like that. They even offered me a GED program while I was there. It was frustrating at times only because of a lack of sleep, and some workplace drama. But, only the type of drama that us as humans will create.

"productive and fun atmoshphere, room for growth","A typical day at Walmart was assisting customers as well as doing truck and placing product where it needed to be. I learned how to manage my time more efficiently because at times there was a high demand for customer assistance and at other times there weren't many customers at all. I would say management was okay. At times it was hard to get in contact with a manager. The workplace culture was great. I worked with very many different types of people. Hardest part of the job I would have to say was knowing where to locate product in the back, it did not always match what inventory said we had. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with different kinds of people and new people each day.",4,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Fort Wayne, IN",4/4/17,2017,4,4
"Good Work, mediocre people","The work you do is standard retail. Stock the shelves, work in the inventory systems. Help customers. It's all fine. The real dynamic thing about this job are the people. Managers, coworkers, and customers. Some are really awesome to work with or help out. However, some people you work with, you may hate. It is very hard to get rid of a person, especially a manager (this didn't personally happen to me). It's aggravating, I had to personally file a harassment claim.

frustrating,"This job was good as far as pay, but management was a little crazy. _x000D_There three managers who each had different expectations which made it difficult to complete a task from one person to the next and each department was understaffed, putting more pressure on the employees to complete more tasks in less time.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Franklin, IN",4/4/17,2017,4,4

judged,The whole time i worked there i did my best and worked fast. As an overnight stocker you have to go fast. You only have four days to learn what to do. The first full shift they team you up with someone but the second day your on your own and if you aren't fast enough they'll pull you aside and tell you that. They expect you to know where everything is the minute you start working. Working electronics and door greeting were the only good parts of working there. They treat there employees like very poorly. For instance I looked at my schedule for the next 3 weeks one time and wasn't scheduled for a whole week. I brought it up to a supervisor who did nothing about it so I brought it up to another supervisor who again did nothing about it. It wasn't until I was waiting for the store manager that my third supervisor came up to me and finally got me scheduled for the week I wasn't scheduled. Basically don't bother getting a job with them. They don't care about there employees or customers.,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker/Cashier ,"Red Bluff, CA",4/4/17,2017,4,4

"It's improved, but not by much","Moving from one department to another usually results in a pay cut, depending on where you're transferred, but it's nice that they give you an entire hour for lunch depending, once again, on which department you work in.

Largely, management focused more on associate teamwork rather than working as a team with each other, and associates could become confused on more than one occasion with conflicting orders from the management team. Still, they made sure to hold to the open door policy, and any issues were heard and addressed with urgency._x000D_The culture of the store was definitely one of family, tight knit and centered around teamwork. A few bad eggs never soured the bunch, and no one could ever go through the day without encouragement from their fellow associates. Hardworking and caring environment._x000D_The hardest part working in this location was the low amount of associates, despite the ideas of teamwork. Associates often had to cover areas they barely knew, and there more often than not was only a single associate in any area at a given time, sometimes one in an entire section of the store._x000D_I definitely enjoyed the community of the store, and the readily available assistance.

A Culture of Intimidation and Bullying,"A very disappointing experience would best describe my time at Walmart. The training (if you can call it that) was a joke.

After four weeks of watching videos on how to talk to customers and employees, I was sent to my store. Upon arrival, I was handed keys and told ""good luck."" From there, it has been a nightmare. My departments are grossly short staffed. My upper management team pulled members from some departments to put in other departments without a plan to replace them.

Productive and unbalanced at times but good teamwork,A typical day at Walmart can be various things from stressful to very satisfying. I learned that teamwork is very important and not having an understanding with other co-workers can cause problems. Management at Walmart in my experience could have been a lot better. There is a family type of culture at Walmart outside of management. The hardest part about working at Walmart is the fact that you never know how that particular day is gonna go. The most enjoyable part about working there is that you have a chance to meet new people.,4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Milledgeville, GA",3/29/17,2017,3,29

Some are more understanding and supportive than others. Some are more by the book, and zero tolerance. My most enjoyable part of my job is working with my coworkers.

Safe and Reliable Workplace,"Wal-Mart is an awesome company. I guess it all depends on which store you work with. A typical day at Wal-Mart is tiresome, and overwhelming. I learned that to be recognized you have to take action yourself. Nobody is there to help or save you. If you want something done you have to do it. Management at MY store is unbelievably ridiculous. I have never met people with absolutely no respect for others. They aren't there to help you or help you persue in your career if anything they rather see you fail. The hardest part of the job is having to do everyone else's job, but your own.

Your day is set and ready to go as soon as you walk through doors.,Typical day at Walmart would start by hitting the floor and finding out what merchandise you need to stalk up on. After you take notes of what you will be pulling out from the freezer and what you will be making ( I was a cake decorator). You pull everything you need from freezers and label them and there ready to be put out.Then I would start working on what needed to be made i would get that done label it as well . When my floor was done I would start the rest of my tasks such as making my cake orders for the day and back ups for the floor.You are constantly washing dishes since icing can be very messy. I would constantly have to stop what I'm doing to take orders or help costumers the key is patience and being able to multitask.  _x000D__x000D_What I learned: My artistic skills came out in this job as I learned how to decorate beautiful cakes this is something that I will probably benefit from for the rest of life.

Unfair Treatment and Ingenuine Interest in Employees,"While it's smart to stay updated and try new things, Walmart is constantly changing back and forth between different ways to handle sales and presentation - it gets very confusing from week to week and, in my experience, not everyone is on the same page. While there are some managers who genuinely care about you as an employee, I've also met managers who only have their own interest in mind. I've met many hard-working associates in the year I've been working for the company, but they seem to be treated poorly compared to the people who don't work as hard (like the employees who have family members in management positions). They also have extremely high and nearly impossible expectations for their associates.",3,Current Employee,Cake Decorator ,"West Lafayette, IN",3/29/17,2017,3,29

Stable work in hourly position.,"As a whole, Wal-Mart is fairly standard when it comes to working as an hourly associate. Pay is average for an entry-level position, and advancement to an hourly supervision role is quite easy to accomplish if you demonstrate average competency. It is, however, a very competitive atmosphere within that tier, and you will be held responsible for many things beyond your control. Salaried Management tends to have very little training and, more often than not, a very unprofessional approach to workplace interaction. If you're simply looking for an easily obtained job, with an unchanging workload day to day, Wal-Mart is an acceptable place to begin.",3,Former Employee,Claims Processor ,"Phoenix, AZ",3/28/17,2017,3,28
"Great pay, long awful shifts","I started working at the Hurricane, UT DC. First off, this is southern Utah and it gets VERY hot down here. There were multiple days that were well over 100 degrees. The building doesn't have any AC in the working areas at all. There are break rooms and offices that do have AC but you're limited to breaks to utilize them. You are hounded for accuracy here. It is very easy to miscount and make small mistakes that you get in trouble for EVERY single time. It is very easy for these mistakes to add up which leads to being fired very quickly. You will work hard here, they pay great, but you're definitely going to earn it. Go for a job that involves power equipment all day here or you will hate it. Management is ok, they try to help you out but like I said, it is very easy to get fired for literally the smallest mistakes.",4,Former Employee,Receiving Associate ,"Hurricane, UT",3/28/17,2017,3,28

Productive and safe,"A typical day at work consists of hauling over pallets from our designated bulk areas to our shipping dock. After we've hauled over all of the daily pallets we have to upstack the pallets that we can. Example: using our RC lifts to stack a lighter pallet on top of a heavier pallet to reduce the amount of space taken up in a trailer. After we finish upstacking we have to load each pallet into the assigned trailer. Each pallet has at least once label on it which designates the store and batch number the pallet is for. When we go to load each pallet we must double scan each label and mark it with a crayon to show we verified that the pallet does go to that store. At the end of each shift we check our reports to ensure we loaded all of the pallets. Before clocking out we must do our daily housekeeping with includes sweeping and emptying our trashcans into a compactor._x000D_I've learned how to properly load a trailer using a brick layer loading style, I've learned how to use two different typed of Powered Equipment, I've learned multiple jobs outside of my designated job title._x000D_Management has always displayed the highest level of integrity and leadership.

Constant passive aggressiveness, whining, intimidations, and incessant condescending, disrespectful, bullying behavior from Sr.. Tech and the idiot creating a hostile environment.

You will also be assigned one task, to only be asked to do another task wild mid task. On top of such, you will also be doing other employees tasks from those of which those employees are either lazy, or don't put forth a hard working effort. The pay is good, and benefits, but what use is it all, when you're working with lazy people and or people whom work you to your bones, for just minimum pay, or close to it. I suggest not working for Walmart, but as a starting job, put in at least 6 months, and then put in your two weeks notice and find better.",3,Former Employee,General Laborer ,"Chino, CA",3/27/17,2017,3,27

Easier than it sounds, really. Great pay considering the job type, good hours, and good management except for ehen it comes to certain things like rude and disrespectful employees. I had a few encounters with one coworker who was just awful and each time I reported it (written and verbal) to management but they never did anything. I had another coworker send me into a panic attack at work and the next day he was cracking jokes to another coworker about. That other coworker went to management with it and they did something then but that is the only time anything was ever done about a disrespectful employee. They just don't seem to care very much if one of their employees is being harrassed and lied on by one of their other employees. That's really the only bad thing about Wal-Mart.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Zanesville, OH",3/27/17,2017,3,27

My first day I was immediately sent off with my mc40 and expected to do my new job. And there was no room for error or a grace period for being new to the job, it was do it right or face the consequences, an intimidating way of thinking when you have no training outside of the computers which did very little to truly help. I did end up learning a lot and am thankful for the assistant manager over me because she did her best to help me, but the constant stress over being spread too thin and not having enough time in a day to to all that I needed to do, as well as not having any help to handle the minor things that could be passed off and lighten my load, made it too much for me to handle any longer",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Rensselaer, IN",3/27/17,2017,3,27
