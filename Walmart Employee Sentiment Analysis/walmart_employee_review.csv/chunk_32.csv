It was a job.,This was a Friday - Sunday  12 hour a day job. I did not enjoy standing stationary at a machine.  More of a move around kind of person.  The hours were not conducive to any type of social life.,2,Former Employee,Technician ,"Crawfordsville, IN",10/23/16,2016,10,23

Bad Bad Bad,"Wal-Mart is terrible with their employees, they only care about making money now days. They really don't even care about their customers any more which is ashame. I have learned that if WalMart management screws up (higher up) your going to get fired one way or another. Some of the managers are great to work for at WalMart but others shouldn't even be there. Co-workers are great, I got along with all the ones I worked with.There wasn't anything hard about working the job I had and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and helping them with all their needs. I would not recommend working at WalMart though if you want a long term career because after you reach a certain amount of years, they find a way to get rid of you so you don't get your benefits. They did that to my husband and they also did to several others I know.",4,Former Employee,Jewelry Sales Clerk ,"Roanoke, VA",10/23/16,2016,10,23

Good pay bad management,Sam's Club pays very well for a retail job. The atmosphere isn't the best though. The employees are somewhat united but not for the better of the club. The management at this place sucks and it makes it very hard on the employees. They tell you that they care about you and will work with you when you're having troubles but they won't actually do anything even if they say they will. The people are nice but the general 'I don't care' feeling in the air makes it hard to work. Everyday I show up for my job all I can think about is getting up and leaving and never coming back. If you're in a bind and just need a good paying job for the time being I would suggest it but don't plan on sticking around too long for the sake of your sanity.,3,Current Employee,Member Services ,"Fargo, ND",10/23/16,2016,10,23

Walmart Employee,It was ok to work for. But when you have a death in the family they aren't that willing to work with you because they are afraid of being sued. You have to contact a third party company to request any time off for personal reasons etc. If you are sick they won't accept that you are sick and if you are out too many days.

The life in a super center,When working at Walmart you have to constantly train because you can be pulled to perform tasks that aren't your usual.

Not the right time in my life,"When I would work at Walmart I would get there at 5:30 p.m. and would stay there until 10:00 p.m. I would run the carts full of picks, or items pulled from our inventory to fill stock outs on the sale floor. I would then look to refill the milk in the display from the cooler. At this point I would go out to the sales floor and make sure the items were presentable and neat. When this would all be done, it would be usually around 8:00 p.m. or 9:00 p.m. and the store would be almost empty. I would then usually clean display windows and then go home at 10:00. I learned to use technology to run pick lists and to work with a to-do list. The management was stretched thin and would often have to be paged when doing takes that had management required portions such as unlocking doors or giving codes. The co-workers there where great and they worked together well. The hardest part of the job was the difficulty of getting key jobs done when managers where hard to be found and the unpredictability of when you can be called away to help others.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Omaha, NE",10/19/16,2016,10,19

"Learn, Work your hardest, get paid little, and feel unnecessary stress.","Despite what one can read about them on Forbes, Walmart is a very cut-throat company to work for. This I feel greatly impacts it's management teams and associates negatively. Walmart effectively practices the chain of screaming. My bosses boss yells at my boss, to which my boss yells at me with the expectation that I would add the same negative pressure to the associates below myself. This negative management style was one experienced on a daily basis with continuing threats to each employees own job security without regard to each of their own actual work ethic._x000D__x000D_Walmart doesn't mask their expectations from associates, though one could easily argue if the pay is anywhere worth those expectations if you are not pursuing promotions within. Despite the toxicity one will receive from half of Walmart's management team, the best of Walmart's managers are always there to pick you back up and motivate you properly to achieve your goals. These men and women were my role models and mentors as I climbed my way through my store eventually leading to multiple interviews for a salaried position, to which I respectfully declined._x000D__x000D_Working at Walmart taught me many things that I hope to carry on through my life.

cook outs for employees,"At this particular Walmart I was considered a one of a kind Door Greeter I excelled at my job. I really liked working there because I would cheerfully greet the customers and at the same time be on the lookout for thieves. I was posted across from the security office. My hours and the days that I worked them were GREAT. My store managers, supervisors and lead people were all very nice as well as easy to get along with. I learned that a simple smile or a polite good morning goes a long way. I really miss that place and the employees that I worked with. I think the hardest part of my job came in the first 4-6 months when standing in one spot was hard until I got use to doing it. The most enjoyable part of my job was bringing joy to others it makes me feel good and I often received complements from those around me, which to me was better than the money.

Management helps out when needed, provided they aren't required elsewhere._x000D__x000D_The biggest issue is scheduling, with several days leaving 3 associates on the floor at a given time, throughout the day (not counting other departments outside Electronics).

Enjoyed working with most of the customers that came thru my register lane.  Each day was different, you never knew what the customers would say; or what management would say to me or my co-workers.  I would make sure the register, the conveyer belt and the area around the register, would be clean and bags were put on the carousel, for the next cashier.  I would greet and interact with customers, answer their question; also, direct them to the right department if needed.  The hardest part of my job, would be dealing with the customers at the service desk, it was also the best part of being a cashier; in that I would be doing something different, other than being just a cashier.

"Good experience, but lousy benefits","The people you work with are usually nice and cooperative. They work well as a tea. Most of the management team listen to what you have to say.

They are willing to hire disabled people(most of time)_x000D__x000D_The health benefits are not worthwhile. You probably get better coverage from other companies. Corporate does not really care about the people down below on the ladder. We do a lot of work and have unstable hours.  Some of the Corporate policies are questionable at times. Such as having customers bring their pet lizards and birds inside the store is allowed.  You are only allowed to use 40 hrs of your sick time a year. Regardless if you have more sick time than 40 hrs. _x000D__x000D_I learned that the labels of the positions do not really mean anything in retail. Sometimes you are required to jobs not part of the position you were hired for. They will hire disable people including deaf like me, Rarely do they ever promote them or have them work  as management or supervisor and such. _x000D__x000D_I learned that they have so many part time workers to save money and expenses because management is graded on how much they save and still be able to do  satisfying results.

This job is not one for me.,I quickly moved up with this company and I quickly knew that it was not the right place for me.  I was over qualified for my position and the managers knew it.

Not a bad job for someone just starting out,"As a cashier, a typical day was standing for however long per shift, scanning items and meaningless chit-chat. If it wasn't too busy then the impulse buy items had to be straightened up and shelves dusted. Every now and then the cashiers would help straighten up the clothing racks that were close to our register. The management at my location wasn't bad, there was a good pyramid system but the higher ups would still go around and see how the employees were doing overall. There was friendly competition with scans per hour so it made it fun some. The hardest part was people trying to convince me that prices were lower than they actually were.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Locust Grove, VA",10/10/16,2016,10,10
"Good work atmosphere ,friendly associates and good benefits.","Working at Walmart overnight is a positive experience ,the work is great the co-workers are friendly and approachable. Staying overnight is a good experience because you learn how too stock and zone departments and you learn different ways of working through pallets full of freight that has too be stocked. The management wasn't really what I expected ,The Managers in charge of working in the office are great but the managers staying with you overnight are the most negative to be around. I had an incident were one of the managers that i worked constantly with would embarrass me in front of my co-workers. Two of the overnight managers would always pressure me and would make me feel less of myself. Constantly rushing me and always criticizing my work and the way i work. They are not professional at all choosing favorites between all of the night crew. I know a lot of my coworkers felt the same way. Getting treated bad and getting ""coachings""another word for warnings more then usual for the littlest thing overall the night managers aren't positive and should be trained in working with associates too make them feel positive about themselves.Co workers are great all friendly and hardworking. The hardest part of the night is the last four hours,we have too finish our work before the store opens with hardly any help.They send help when the store is one hour before opening.The most enjoyable part is when we go on break it is an hour long and is good if you wanna enjoy your meal outside in your car or inside the break room watching the companies tv.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker/Customer Service ,"Fontana, CA",10/10/16,2016,10,10
Best Lesson From A bad experience,I did not enjoy working with Walmart. They showed very little management skills constantly replacing managers and showing very little care for their employees. The working conditions were horrible with constant fighting and gossip between both managers and employees The lesson I learned from this experience is that making yourself better and representing your employers is far more beneficial then lowering yourself to those who do not appreciate their opportunity or acknowledge the joy of being employed. We all should represent our jobs and their associates in a way we would all expect.,2,Former Employee,Door Greeter/Cashier/Stocker ,"Hammond, IN",10/10/16,2016,10,10

Decent workplace with good people.,"I learned working at Walmart that the managers can be hard to deal with from time to time, but in one hear out the other and get my job done. The co-workers were typically awesome people and I enjoyed working there and having their company. Typical work days depended on the days we got trucks, which were Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. We had coordinated areas we all knew how to do efficiently and worked as a team to make sure all the work got done. Go from one area to another, if someone is struggling we'd lend a hand. For me, there was no hard part of the job, all of it was pretty basic and if you had questions you asked your management on what to do. I'd have to say the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people in the job itself.",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Blue Earth, MN",10/10/16,2016,10,10

Very Productive and competitive wages,"I'm pretty sure everyone has or had a job in a Walmart before, and we all know the stories that generated witch each position held. I had one position as a telephone operator, and although the wage at the time was unfair I managed, I learned a lot about how Walmart started and a little more about my position and how to be a sales associate. The story about Walmart having very rude employees is average , but I barely paid attention to that because I was an employee myself and, I did not care to know about how rude I might have been with a customers , because you will find one anywhere from my personal experience as a customer. I had two very cool co-workers that I became incredibly close to and created  immediate relations with, this job was very easy although what makes it hard is the drama encountered every so often. I was never a part of the drama starting crew but I had a blast from all the entertaining associated with it .

"Loads of work in short amount of time, high expectations, bad management","I've only worked as a night stocker at WalMart for about 4 months and it's probably been the most stressful and demanding months of my life. Our old managers were great (they switch out every 6 months), our new ones however are terrible. The old ones would have workers come help other departments once they were finished with their own, they didn't hound you to get loads of work done each night, and they made sure to keep you updated on your workload and schedule. Our new managers are down right rude, they expect each and every associate to get around 10+ hours of freight, zoning, and return carts done within 7-8 hours. They expect all of us to know how to make bales yet none of the new associates were taught how to make them and they'll throw you in a new department a few times a week and expect new associates to know where everything is within an hour and get everything done. I work in housewares, domestics, and crafts and each night we are absolutely loaded with freight and return carts it's unreal. We're extremely understaffed, we've always got remodel in our way, they rarely if ever send help, and they continue to bring back stock you worked the previous night out as if merchandise has sold out over night. One of my managers compared my roommate/coworker to his autistic cousin and another watched her constantly and always had something smart to say although she always worked hard, she quit after a month. We've had 10 night stockers, one manager, and 8 remodel quit just within the past two months, which is about the same amount of time we've had these new managers. _x000D_Other - more...",3,Current Employee,Night Stocker ,"Danville, KY",10/9/16,2016,10,9

It isn't at all bad if retail is what you enjoy. Unfortunately though there are too many people over you that aren't ever on the same page.,"My time here paid the bills. I started as a Wireless Associate and greatly enjoyed helping customers every day, not to mention I was in electronics which is kind of my element. It wasn't until I decided to take a management position over hardware, paint, and stationary that I began disliking the environment. I also found out I wasn't alone in disliking my job as a department manager. There are a dozen daily things that absolutely need to be done in each department that take, in all, much longer than an eight hour day, but despite that, you have every manager up the chain from you demanding that you do what they want done now. I get it. I really do. These things need to be done for the store to operate properly but there isn't the man power to do it. But like I said; if you really enjoy retail or you know you are good with people then by all means give it a try. You may like it because some do.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Reno, NV",10/9/16,2016,10,9

Walmart what else is there to say?,People were great but the company itself did not take care of there employees. I would not recommend anyone to seek employment here.

Under paid and over worked,"My coworkers and management team are amazing, the company how ever has unrealistic expectations. We have been told to take an energy drink every night so that we can get our work done because if you're not hopped up on something you will never finish. If you dont finish on time  you are subject to termination or other disciplinary actions. the quickest workers have trouble finishing. these problems would arise if they were ""allowed"" more staff. most issues are because of man power but with such a high turn over rate and the company paying less than the agreed amounts people tend to not want to work for walmart. I on the other hand NEED this job so i deal with everything. I dont recommend working for the company with the frequently changing policies and cheated wages but desperate times call for desperate measures so you suck it up and go to work. im guaranteed a paycheck here when many people are struggling to find work.",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Elgin, TX",10/6/16,2016,10,6

The Greatest Job to Leave,"I worked Walmart store 1966 in Geneseo NY for almost a year. I was hired at full time only part time hours. The managers are lazy, complacent and don't care about safety or even doing their jobs. They spend all their time on their cell phones hiding in offices in the back. When I would inform them of major issues, safety issues or not having the equipment to do my job they just rolled their eyes at me and walked away. They are so badly understaffed because most people quit before their 90 days are completed! There is a lot of favoritism at Geneseo Walmart especially among night managers.  The best thing I ever did was quit. Walmart doesn't care about their associates only how much work they can get out of them for little pay. They like to play the blame game, especially Arlene who doesn't do her job! She is made aware of the issues and ignores you or makes up excuses for her lack of management! If you are a female she is harder on you than the guys! Walmart as a company is a bunch of liars and full of back stabbing!",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Geneseo, NY",10/4/16,2016,10,4

Not a bad place to work if you are retired or just looking for a little extra spending money.,"In the busy part of the day you are very rushed, and because you are dealing with money you are watched like a hawk. I did learn new skills such as merchandising (preparing the shelves according to who is paying top dollar for a particular shelf or section on the shelf). I also learned that the worst time to work there is during the holidays, not so much fun. Co-workers tend to keep to themselves and don't seem to be very happy or friendly. Hardest part of the job is dealing with such strange scheduled hours, there are no set hours(8-5, M-F etc) per day or per week, they tend to jump all over the place making work life balance almost impossible. Very rarely do you ever get a forty hour week unless you work in the pharmacy. There are some customers that are rude and obnoxious and the holidays brings out the worst in them. The most enjoyable part of the day is quitting time after standing on your feet all day you are ready to go home. Not really intended to be a career choice unless you are going to be a store manager.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Morton, IL",10/4/16,2016,10,4

Walmart's Review,"This was a fast paced environment with great coworkers and employees. Management helps their new employees with ease with any help they need while on the floor.

Employees are not treated fairly,"I have learned the hard way that Walmart does not treat it's employees as well as they should. They let harassment go unnoticed. If you are not a manager or supervisor, you are just a piece of the corporate machine to them. One of my two supervisors has no respect for anyone, especially the people he is over.

Productive learning day in apparel,"Walmart has many different areas for employees to branch off and work in. My favorite happened to be apparel. Normally our task for the day is very simple and easy, I just have to open packages and sort clothes by gender. Sometimes we will have a huge truck to come in so my managers and a few co-workers will come and grab boxes to sort out, which is a tremendous help because it takes a burden off of my shoulder. I'm typically the only one in the stock room sorting out close to 200-250 boxes of apparel everyday. It can become overwhelming if you don't learn to pace yourself. The best part of the job is you control your breaks/lunch and your work pace. I make sure that my task is completed before going home.

Walmart is alright.,Walmart is an alright place to work. It really just depends on what part of the store you desire to work at. It is very easy to move up if you bring determination and dress professional. I was to move up to a customer service manager in half a year of working there if it wasn't for a relative being a manager at the same store so I had to be a customer service associate. The real downfall of Walmart and with their customer service is that the managers expect you to follow policy but will overrule policy and make you look ignorant. They put you in situations to fail and get coached. You only get three before being fired. The managers are allowed to add tweaks to the policy and if you don't follow them it won't work out for you. My store has some really amazing managers but some that aren't which is normal. I recommend anyone who wants to work at Walmart to not work in the front end unless you really have a great costumer service attitude.,3,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Okmulgee, OK",10/3/16,2016,10,3

Developed and Growth,One of the greatest things I learned from my experience working for Walmart was how to become a better manager. A better manager isn't about numbers and how you perform but rather how you develop your team. To be able to grow together for the better of the employee and the business. Great customer service isn't always just for the customers but also your members working side by side you.

Lost benifits.,I left Walmart because I became part time as well as so many other full time employee and lost my benefits. Walmart as a company doesn't treat the employ fairly. They try to get as much work out of the least amount of employees. No one really liked their job because of this. Managers at Walmart didn't even seem to like their job. Everyone was just going through the motions for a paycheck.,2,Former Employee,Produce Associate ,"Lubbock, TX",10/2/16,2016,10,2
Interesting,"Typical day is running freight, cleaning up [zoning], and doing our best to help customer with what they need. Learn how to let thing roll off of you when angry customers come in when there isn't much we can do to help them. Most management is alright but like some jobs some people have favorites and some times its hard. Most Co Workers are amazing. I doubt I will ever come across so many people that I really enjoy working with. Some days we have time management issues and don't communicate with each other as we should but most of the time its a great bunch to work with. Hardest part of the job is manly when we have those tuff customers that you just cant please. The best part is my co workers and the really good customers that just make all the bad customers worth dealing with.",3,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Reidsville, NC",10/2/16,2016,10,2

"Stressful, demanding work place with little regard for associates","Walmart has declined in their attitude and view on customers and associates. The company they want to present is a lie to the public and the people who work for them. Walmart is more concerned about the bottom dollar instead of providing great customer service. Home office dictates what they want to happen but with little or no understanding of the ramifications that will take place. A typical work day is usually dominated by being forced to work alone in customer service while the line continues to grow with customers becoming increasingly upset. Also, in order to avoid dealing with a customer one on one, managers will have associates go against policy to keep the customer happy and make the associate seem as though they do not know how to do their job. I would not recommend that people apply to Walmart or even shop there.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Garden City, ID",10/2/16,2016,10,2

Management did what they could to help us out but management was fairly good. I learned the proper way to change a tire and headlight. co-workers were always needed depending on the day, they were good to have around because having co-workers was very helpful. the hardest part of the job was trying to take lunches without leaving a tech in the shop by himself. the most enjoyable part of the job was tire races with co-workers.",4,Former Employee,Tire and Lube Technician ,"Mount Pleasant, IA",10/2/16,2016,10,2

inviting atmosphere,"Hallmark is a wonderful company and the store is beautiful. It's very inviting. Employee-customer relations go well. However, sales is obviously not for me. I have no interest in attempting to sell something in any way shape or form. Being on one's feet all day is extremely uncomfortable, pain inducing, aggravating, and down right distracting - especially when the employee wears dress shoes of any kind as opposed to athletic shoes or sneakers. The same can be said about wearing uncomfortable and overly warm dress clothing - specifically in the required arrangement of black slacks and a white dress blouse (while having to be thrifty because the future employee has no money). I fully realize this is standard and an important part in looking professional - the comfort of employees should be important too. Also, working in a job where one is on their feet most of the day or all day can lead to conditions like plantar faschiitis. Again sales is not my forte.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Hanover, PA",9/30/16,2016,9,30

"Avoid the Wal-Mart Trap. If you are looking for a steady paycheck or career opportunities, look elsewhere.","I've been working at Wal-Mart for close to 3 years now as a part-time Associate and it has felt like a dead-end since day one. Despite working with the company for 3 solid years I still struggle to make it from paycheck to paycheck due to the fact that my scheduled hours will fluctuate almost weekly.

All in all, it's not a difficult job, and the worst that can be said about the job itself is that it can be a little boring most days.

I got coaching and fired over someone not working. It is a slave company and does not give two f*cks about their associate. The only people who ""Enjoy/love"" the company are those white people who automatically get an management job. They only want money and will milk you of everything you have until they decide to lie and get rid of you. If they don't like you, they will make it hard for you to get a job by lying.

"Nice Supervisors, nice backroom with reclining massage chairs.","My day starts when I clock in for work. I go to the front and search for a supervisor to tell me where to go. They tell me to either go on a register, or a self checkout. On registers, I make sure I scan every item and bag it in an organized manner. I make the customer happy by asking how their day was or talk about something that they show interest in so they feel comfortable. I count money and give the correct change back so that the customer gets the correct amount of change back, and the company is not losing money. At the self Checkout, I make sure that the items are scanned correctly. Sometimes, items are scanned twice or not at all. It is important to pay attention, especially if I am in charge of multiple registers. I also help customers if they have a problem or if they have questions. The management is pretty good, they are nice, but they are disciplined enough to get the job done. My co-workers are amazing, we get along nicely. The hardest part of the job is making sure that everyone is happy. Sometimes customers come in with a bad mood and it is impossible to make them happy. I had one customer ask me to be quiet and just bag her items, after all I said was ""Hello, how are you?"" Sometimes people have a bad day, but I learned to be sensitive to a person's situation. The best part of my job is bagging Items. I think it's pretty fun trying to decide which item goes in what bag.

Wal-mart is very nice place to work at times. Management and training is what ruined my experience.,Wal mart was a nice place for me when i was able to work and left alone by the management. Management gets involved in things and tells associates to do things knowing that most associates have not been trained right. Every time there is a visiting manager disappointed with something management will throw those same associates under the bus and coach them. It was very discouraging for me as one the hardest workers in the store to witness that and even be a victim of it myself. Wal mart as a company talks a good game but does not have enough oversight to enforce things at a store level.,2,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Erwin, NC",9/28/16,2016,9,28

My co-workers were generally quite friendly and eager to teach me what I needed to learn, or else learn from me as a more senior employee. This job was by no means difficult, and the hardest part for me was working nights with a lot of downtime. It's tough to find things to do when you can only leave the sales floor sparingly. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding exactly what the customer needs, when they don't already know. Figuring out what may have gone wrong with the products they had at home, and telling them the solution, is extremely satisfying.",4,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Wylie, TX",9/28/16,2016,9,28

So the management changed and many new people were hired. No management was in the shop half the time and when they was. No managing was being done, just critizing everyone while leaning on the gate not helping when we was being hit hard. Have to say there was 2-3 of us that ran that place better then management ever did.

Not a fun place,I worked in the pharmacy as a cashier. I learned how to pull meds and how to use the scan system they had. Management was not that great and seemed to only help those that had been there the longest.

Management was friendly, helpful, kind, understanding and mindful of their staff; especially the Store Manager, Co-Managers and some Assistant Managers. Co-workers were helpful. Hardest part of the job was the lifting of heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part was, whenever I interact with the customers and made some acquaintances out of it.

A place to work.,"It was a fine enough place to work, I worked in electronics, and it wasn't anything too physically strenous working there.

I enjoy meeting new people and hearing what they have to say. The hardest part is when a customer gets frustrated, because we ask for an ID. However, I never let that get in the way of my work. I try to explain the situation as best as I can, and majority of the time I have to page a manager (CSM). The management at Walmart is very unorganized. Sometimes we have to leave our registers to go find them. Sometimes we have to page them several times, because we can't find them.

Very fast paced and demanding work,"I really ended up feeling like I had a rewarding experience getting to know so many of my coworkers here.  As far as cleanliness, this restaurant suffered greatly.  The management was pretty harsh, but at least stayed in contact well with the general staff.  Customers seem confused about whether a tip is part of a servers pay at this particular establishment because it is a buffet setting, but management paid about 2.65 dollars per hour.  Servers bus their own sections of about 12 tables that seat about 4 people. Heavy busing due to the nature of the restaurant.

I think that the hardest part of working there was the fact that I was never left in one department for long. I really enjoyed my coworkers and the customers.,3,Former Employee,Photo Specialist ,"Newport, AR",9/26/16,2016,9,26

Great work performance with poor Customer Service,"WalMart was a more go with the flow type of job. Everyday was extremely busy and had conflict that came along with it. I learned to speak up for myself instead of getting run over by coworkers and management. The management and staff were very poor when it came to caring to their workers needs. My coworkers were positive, caring, and supportive non the less. But it was made me feel like I was working myself for no reason. Some days were exhausting and some days were energizing. The hardest part was getting through the day itself. But what made me stay at the job was that I learned more and experienced more about customer service. knowledgeable",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service Representative ,"Aurora, CO",9/26/16,2016,9,26
Need to allow apa to do their job.,"Asset Protection Managers don't listen when you tell them there are problems. They don't address issues until their Market Asset Protection Managers get onto them for it. They complain about losing so much product but refuse to let us take steps to secure under the excuse that it would not be customer friendly.

Fast paced and miserable,"I did not enjoy this job. Management  treat employees very poorly. I only worked there for a month and then left due to the top store manager refusing to work with my scheduled time off and telling me that he didn't like me and that no one liked me. Claiming that was why I had no friends. That was literally the 2nd time I had ever seen him.

Very busy and fast paced setting,"When I first started working at Walmart I spent my time working as a cashier.

Anywhere from returns, paying bills, cashing checks, and helping out with important questions. The co-workers were all great people to work with and made it easier to have a positive attitude. The hardest part of the job was when customers would have carts full of items and a lot of price matches. It made it harder to work fast and customers in line would become angry. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting complimented when a customer was satisfied with my skills. It assured me I was doing what I was supposed to be doing.

"Nice building, not so nice managers","I provide this review as a former cart attendant working part-time (20-32 hrs/week) while going to school full-time (online). _x000D__x000D_I was originally hired as a cashier but only worked this position for about 4 months because although it was very easy, it was also quite slow for a lack of customers (newer store, not as many people know the location). This would be fine in many cases, but you have a number of CSM's (direct supervisors) micromanaging you far too often, some nicer than others. By August, I had requested a position change to cart attendant (cart pusher/gather/etc.) because I wanted to get away while still making some money. _x000D__x000D_I initially loved it for there was so much more freedom, fresh air, natural light (that didn't give you headaches), constantly busy moving (gathering carts, picking up trash, etc.), even if it was a little hotter/humid outside it was worth it in my honest opinion. _x000D__x000D_After a few months went by, right around the Holidays, the store apparently got a bad review from corporate (i.e. very disorganized, lack of communication, etc.), all of which and more was true. After that, all levels of management became super strict right away without any warning, new rules, enforcing old rules, and even more micromanagement believe it or not. The further down the ladder you were (like me, a cart pusher), the worse you got it. Now I consider myself a very hard-worker (as many that know me would agree)  and pretty tough when it comes to not letting things get under my skin, but there were many times I felt harassed, demeaned, and even bullied by one higher up - more...",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Cart Attendant ,"Wesley Chapel, FL",9/26/16,2016,9,26

There was always something to do whether it was paperwork, cleaning, restocking, etc. The co-workers there were all very friendly for the most part. Occasionally different personalities would clash but that was all mostly due to the massive age differences in some of the employees. The best part about the job was the flexibility you had with your schedule and the amount of benefits you would receive after your first few months of staying.

Walmart.,A typical day at Walmart an associate will preform nearly every task in the store except what they were hired for. Different managers will delegate to you what benefits them and their coverage areas. Most associates will be unhappy at all times because they are dealing with the same treatment and poor pay. The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out the process of the business as minimal training is provided. An associate for Walmart will learn a lot about inventory and customer interaction.,1,Former Employee,Inventory Associate ,"Jupiter, FL",9/24/16,2016,9,24
Depends on the location and connection to higher level management,"Good company to work for when the store manger is a intelligent proactive hard worker. The Assistant mangers also play a key role in the success of the store and work environment. Bad attitudes and poor work ethics effects everyone. The stock is decent.

it is walmart..... what else can be said,my experience at all four walmarts is that you never know where you stand with the company and if you do real well and excel at your job management will assume you are after their job and report fictitious problems to upper management..... you will NEVER know because upper management never communicates middle managements problem with you.

"The atmosphere was pretty chaotic with certain supervisors but once issues were rectified, the job was fun, fast paced, and a great experience.",A typical day at work required you to be a self starter. I always stayed on top of my tasks and I eventually received an offer to take over the deli department as manager. Most of my co-workers were amazing to work with and some were difficult but we had a mutual understanding that completing our set goals for the day was the main focus and we always executed them with high marks. The hardest part of the job was sometimes having a heavy work load due to co-workers slacking or calling off for the day often leaving the team one to two men short.

Challenging and fast paced work environment,"Once clocking in, the pace was fairly fast paced in the pharmacy.  There was nearly always clients waiting in line to be served and phone calls that needed to be answered and redirected.  Prescriptions that had been filled need to be placed correctly in order to locate it quickly once the patient came to pick it up.  Friendly and informative service was always expected and given with the expectation the pharmacy technician would provide information within their scope of practice and refer more advance information (i.e. patient counseling on medications) to the pharmacist.  My co-workers were hard worker and worked together well while I was there and management was actively involved in the day to day activities within the pharmacy.  The most difficult aspect of the job was dealing with aggressive and rude customers.  I learned that keeping calm, listening, and treating the patient respectively was helpful in helping to calm down and upset customer and enabled me to work with them.  The most enjoyable part of the job was continuing to learn new information on medications, their usages, and other aspects of a pharmacy technician position.",3,Former Employee,Pharmacy Cashier ,"Norfolk, VA",9/24/16,2016,9,24

Decent part time job with few opportunities,"Walmart was a fairly decent workplace, at least at the store that I worked at.  From other, more veteran employees who had worked at multiple locations, I understand that the overall experience depends heavily on which store you work at and the management at the store.  My store was high traffic, so there was a lot of work to be done on a day to day basis, but most of my managers and fellow employees were good people, with the exception of the store manager.  I worked in the stock room separating new freight by department so that it could be worked by the night shift, and almost every day was hard work in hot, cramped conditions.  The culture is heavily resistant to change and improvement, and most changes in the store layout and procedures come from corporate.  Maintenance on essential equipment (cardboard baler, trash compactor, floor scrubber, etc.) was slow to be implemented, in part because of inaction on the part of the management.  Essential maintenance supplies were slow to arrive.  For instance, we once waited almost six months for an order of mops to reach the store after they were presumably ordered.  Many departments within the store were understaffed, presumably to save money.  In my opinion, many of these shortcomings are because of a culture of cutting costs wherever possible, even when the associates and customer satisfaction suffer.  Job security is good, provided you show up to work on time and do your job.  Advancement is possible within the company, but it requires extensive dedication to the job at the expense of your personal life.

Review From a Former Stocker (DETAILED),"-Typical day? Go to the daily meeting, check your tasks, complete those tasks all while giving customers excellent service and assistance._x000D__x000D_-What did I learn? Get your tasks done. Don't procrastinate. Always check the outside of aisles in case more ""freight"" (new items to stock) have been set out for you to ""throw"" (stock and put in correct areas). ""Zone"" (organize items on shelves/make the displays look great) only the first two items in a spot so if a customer picks up one, there's still another waiting for the next customer and the whole area still looks pretty presentable. Also, watch your step. You'd be surprised how slippery spilled sugar, flour, oats, and rice are. You never know what can spill._x000D__x000D_-Management? It was sometimes difficult to find a Co-Manager or Assistant Manager when something crazy or confusing happened. Support Managers were typically a call away if you needed help. The higher up of a manager you sought help from, the better help you were going to get._x000D__x000D_-Co-workers? Most of them were very very nice to me and helped me out. I have became friends with a handful of them outside of work. There was some drama and some people talked about one another though. A select few would flirt and get uncomfortably close at times which made me wonder how they even got the job. They and another particular person that harassed me (not knowing I have depression and anxiety) were one of the main reasons I left._x000D__x000D_-Hardest part of the job...

Each and every one of them knew their role and provided it to our department making it easier on our individual selves. When one of us didn't know what to do, we'd help one another with the task.

Basically nothing good,"A typical day at work: There was no typical day, your ""job title"" is a joke because they expect you to do anything and everything they need/want at any given moment. This includes, cashiering, pushing carts in any weather, unloading the truck, stocking in other departments, zoning in other departments, etc. The store I worked at had a 2pm-3pm zone hour where basically everyone was expected to go to the grocery department to zone an aisle while most of the time the managers just stood around and watched.

Example, a guy was hired on the same time as me and got promoted to department manager of grocery on his third month (min. they are suppose to be allowed to promote), shortly after he was put in jail for armed robbery. The upper (salaried) management usually treats the hourly management very badly (including screaming at them over the walkie's) so the good ones leave/quit. _x000D__x000D_The corporate management has NO CLUE what really goes on in stores and they don't understand why they are shorthanded or things don't get done.

When I work somewhere I give it my all because its my place of work so to speak. I like to honor whats handed to me and do the best of my ability to get tasks done that need done.

I loved working on cars and getting to know the vehicles._x000D_The management was poor and full of greed and lies.

Poor management,Just because you have more managers doesn't mean you'll have better management. I feel as though all employees are stuck in a predicament to cover their own butts rather than work as a team to succeed and that in itself was a horrible feeling. Managers liked to use fear tactics to scare you in to staying at a low paying job that couldn't even make regular bills. Nothing like feeling drained at the end of the week and not getting anywhere.

Dealing with inventory,The typical day begins if you work overnight with a meeting where you learn where you are going to work within the store. Management does not communicate between shifts and some times provides false information. The associates work as if being robots and are down trodden and penalized for calling in sick and moving to different cities.

Productive and friendly workplace with understanding supervisors and co workers,"A typical day at Walmart would start off somewhat slow depending on the time of the month, and then ending at steady or fast pace. I learned how to work better with the public, run different cash registers, handle different types of checks, coupons, and vouchers, and handle larger amounts of money. The management at Walmart was great at the time! Very friendly and understanding individuals. I can't say that I've had many bad experiences at Walmart. Mostly good.

Lots of work to do but bad management!,"Every night is the same night! You clock in have a meeting in the break room with all of the associates and with all the overnight managers. During the meeting you are given a task from the head manger for the night to tell you what department you are to be working in and how long it should take you to put the merchandise up. Also they give incites on whats right with the store and whats bad, events or issues and lets not to mention what we can improve on associates of the store.After the meeting the associates are walking towards there departments and start working on their pallets. Some pallets smaller than others and some even taller/bigger or messier than others either way it had to get worked. Even if you have 10 hours of freight and you only had 8 hours of your shift. Wal-Mart does not provide the store with a good amount of maintenance positions so all associates would have to clean up in their own area. They don't provide enough experienced workers and don't help advance their alumni workers. Every sales associate/stocker  is provided to do there tasks and also complete other tasks that the managers don't want to do there self. There is a lack of management skills at Wal-Mart because most make bad or poor choices when under pressure. They tend to overlook constantly with what the associates need or suggest.The hardest part of working there would be dealing with the managers because they think the associates don't know whats best for the store. They definitely stop acknowledging the overnight crew and don't treat them once in a while anymore.

I, also, made some customers my loyal customers who sought me out specifically. That was cool. Management tends to indulge in favoritism. The managers are, either, really cool or they have nasty attitudes.

Walmart is a decent way to earn a living if you are just starting out in your work history or are in need of a retirement supplement job.,"There is a lot of standing in one place, and opportunities to clean up the aisles and fold clothes when it gets slow.  When it gets busy with customers you may stand in one spot for long periods of time just scanning items and collecting tender.  I learned how to tell if a bill is legal tender or counterfeit, I learned how to treat people in a friendly way, even when they are being annoying, obnoxious, or being otherwise hard to deal with.  Management it alright, sometimes hard to get help when needed if it's a busy day where a lot of people are having troubles, but they are mostly willing to listen to your problems and concerns.  The co-workers are nice and generally will get their fair share of the job done.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get credit card applications, which are tied to your bonus along with if the customers are taking the survey, and other ways they ask you to engage the customer.

Walmart,Clock in and go to a meeting. Followed by going to the aisle and down stacking our pallets to stock. Stock the merchandise and front the products. Greet customers on the aisles.

Associates are very Expendable and underappreciated by the Managers and bosses,So working at Walmart seemed like a great thing at first but after a little while i realized something wasn't right about the Company. The Managers were often negligent with myself and their Employees/Associates and you often had to track them down just to ask a question or get certain things done. They were good as far as getting you your check on time but there are many other areas that they need to improve on. I'm not going to put the Company in the dirt completely though. Working here taught me a lot about dealing with people and working in Retail but they should just learn to treat their Employees.

Descent Place to Work,"You are expected to do too much as a department manager every day. It's really only you working your departments because communication is difficult. Especially between management, the morning shift, second shift, and third shift people. Everyone blames the other shifts for the disasters and the lack of work being done.

"Decent for short term, but unorganized and understaffed","It's okay. There's a need to be very specific about your availability. Saying it's open means one day you're working until midnight and then coming in the next day at 7 am. Waiting for assistance at the register is a pain and can take longer than it should. Sometimes you don't get one (or any) of your breaks and only get your lunch. Sometimes you get locked out of your register before you get sent to lunch.

Productive but need better management from the overnight managers,"The ""day"" would start out alright, just go through our meeting and make sure everyone knows what departments they are working in. By the time the breaks and lunch came around, the manager would pull away my coworkers that are suppose to help me in the department to talk to them about places he could get an apartment or if he should get a pet, etc.. I learned time management and how to get work done very effectively. My coworkers arent the hardest workers in the world. They tend to slack off when they know the manager is across the store or take longer breaks than we are suppose to. The hardest part of the job was staying up all night long when your sleep schedule is messed up. It feels like an eternity just getting half way through the night. I enjoyed my coworkers.

Very Stressful,"A typical day at Walmart is always fast-paced. Unfortunately my experience at Walmart wasn't as I expected it to be. The managers expected too much from associates in departments that were always short staffed. The hardest part of my job was trying to get all of my assignments done in a day while helping customers. Generally it is fairly easy to do both and I don't have a problem doing so but the management at my store were very strict about assignments so it put a lot of extra stress on all of the associates. The most enjoyable part of my job was most of my coworkers and several of the customers that came through, especially the regulars.

I loved my peers here,"I enjoyed hanging out with my peers in the break room. Even while working with them, it would always be fun and productive. The hardest part of the job would have been, the customers. The customer is always right motto, need to get tossed out. They feels as if they have power over us and so we as the associate get stepped on by everyone including management. My lovely co-workers were and will always be the reason to get off of bed in the morning to show up for work. Management is a joke, they forget how it was when they started from the bottom. They treat anyone who doesn't kiss their boots, just as bad as customers do. Those who have heart and low self esteem tend to be the first to go. The ones who swallow their pride and are courageous will make it through such a rough environment. A typical day at work would be to keep the department clean and help all customers who are within 10 feet of me with any questions or concerns they may have.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Hartford, CT",9/6/16,2016,9,6

Busy Productive Days,"Walmart is always busy in the mornings and as Cashier I was able to keep the lines moving without having to slow down. I learned how to communicate with people, no matter how upset or confused they are. Unfortunately the management did not respect cashiers and only decided to help us out when it was convenient for them. This made me learn that I needed to stand on my own two feet. The hardest part of the job would have been operating Self-Checkout with eight stations and only one person managing it. The rules for Self-Checkout state that there should be always two people in the area instead of one.

Good transitional job,"Working at a WalMart store is pretty much as one would imagine; working hours are okay once you've been there awhile, pay isn't the best, and your days are fairly busy. Management is pretty hit or miss. Either your manager is qualified and does their job well or they have their job because they've been working there for awhile and don't really have the interpersonal skills nor qualifications/attitude to be an effective manager. It's really about the relationship you have with your co-workers that make the job rewarding.",4,Former Employee,Department Head/Inventory Control/CSM ,"Fort Worth, TX",9/6/16,2016,9,6

Often I will work at the till in my department, but I also will work on the sales floor from time-to-time. Sales floor work involves straightening up merchandise on shelves and guiding customers to their desired items. Working on the till involves scanning items and settling price disputes with customers by having co-workers and managers weigh in on the debates.

I think working retail definitely prepares you for just about anything: you really have to focus and dedicate yourself to your people and clients.,"You can't really characterize one typical day in retail, because business is always changing. Just like the stock market sales and profit is always moving: some days its down and others it jumps back up: there is always going to be adjustments that need to be made, which requires an all around team effort. The best part of my job is the hearts of people willing to work along side me because I'm willing to work with them. Young adults putting in their time and effort to go above and beyond simply because their manager is willing to work right beside them, and set boundaries, safety precautions, and a comforting outlet to make changes if there lies any problems. The hardest part would be the ability to manage time, when you're in the most chaotic environment of unpredictability, but I've learned if you work hard and lead your people to the correct expectations you can minimize these issues.  I will say that when you work retail there seems to be a lack of taking proper responsibility. Instead of shouldering a decision that you had to make for the act of business, we have managers who like to shift accountability to hourly associates, when the situation should of just been explained or properly followed guidelines and regulations you wouldn't have any issues. Being a leader is taking direct responsibility for your team, if your team fails: then it wasn't just the action of one individual it was the systemic flaw to the whole structure.",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Powhatan, VA",9/6/16,2016,9,6

A very good work experience depending on location,Worked at the walmart in cleveland tx for nearly a year. Very good pay and wonderful enviroment when management kept their distance. Offen theyd constantly go to other employees and heckle them and also come to my crew and ask them to perform a task that would impede or overall cancel the task they were told to do without my consent or knowledge. Its not too serious until the store manager asks you why something didnt get done and you dont have an answer.,4,Former Employee,Hourly Supervisor ,"Cleveland, TX",9/6/16,2016,9,6

Walmart is a great option if you don't have a family to support.,While working at Walmart I did not feel like I was valued as a person or an employee.

"fast pace, high demanding job","A typical day for myself starts off having a meeting arranging where all the associates will be working in all of the areas. Followed by the nightly register pulls while also assisting customers or running a register. Over the years I have learned better ways to handle customers in tough situations, to be firm yet gentle. Then turning around just to be ambushed by more customers or associates. I've spent the last two and a half years as an Overnight Support Manager.

An honest review from an active associate.,"I've been at Walmart for over 3 years now. Yet I make the minimum 10 dollar-ish wage like most of the people I know. They started me off at $7.70 when I first joined. Recently everyone got bumped to 9 or 10 dollars an hour._x000D__x000D_You can't ask for a raise. And the raise they give you each year is pitiful. I think my last one was 28 cents. The chances of you getting promoted are slim at best. They simply have too many candidates to choose from. Everyone in the store applies for new management positions when they open. But most of the time they just find someone from outside of the company or from another store._x000D__x000D_You will NEVER get overtime, under any circumstance. They also cut your hours on and off. It's always been that way. Even dept managers have been getting reduced hours as of late._x000D__x000D_They actively try to find ways to screw you when it comes to money. For example, I know several people who work full-time hours, but are kept as part-time associates. I was one of them._x000D__x000D_They're also extremely anti-union because they don't want to pay their workers a decent wage. They will show you union propaganda videos when you first join. It is very strange and bizarre._x000D__x000D_They rant and rave that there is so much opportunity there. They try to deceive you by saying these things because why else would you stay there? I've seen dozens of associates come and go during my time._x000D__x000D_I've been in 3 different departments officially and also help others. That is one thing you can expect at Walmart. They rather have one person do 2 or 3 jobs instead of hiring someone else._x000D__x000D_Overall, it is a - more...",1,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"San Antonio, TX",9/2/16,2016,9,2

Loved the job hated the people,I worked for Walmart almost 2 years in my short time there one assistant manager basically ran the whole store. If your not in with management kiss any possible promotion goodbye. This place was full of drama! They changed your schedule constantly sometimes without notice.

Start getting ready to unload the truck, so we have to make sure we have on our safety gear on then put down pallets and set up the line for the items.

work place,Nice place to work for a temporary job. Doesn't give workers enough hours. if you want a part time job this would be great.

For a starting company it was good.,"Starting on the typical day was pretty much a get up and go, slowing down as the night moved on. Starting out as a new employee there wasn't much teaching more of looking on the computer and doing a quiz and if your starting to get the hang of it, they have you get to work immediately and learn on the job from your fellow associates. Most of my fellow associate were nice upbeat people where if you need something explained they would help, but most of the management had their groups which they casually hang around and there was kind of an invisible wall between staff positions. I think the hardest part of the job would have been when other positions would be behind you or another associate would occasionally be moved leaving the rest of the team under handed, but the most enjoyable would have to be that your never in the same place long and that most coworkers had such distinctive personalities that just all came together perfectly.",4,Former Employee,Modular Team Associate ,"Crowley, TX",8/31/16,2016,8,31

mediocre,"You have the opportunity to assist individuas with various needs. I learned working here that hard work pays off whether you get promoted or not.

Good company to work for but Management team needs improvement,"Walmart is an overall good company to work for. They are very involved in the community and take pride in satisfying the customers. They love to give incentives to associates when goals have been reached. The negative aspect of it, is that the workload given can at times be a little unrealistic. Especially when management do not have knowledge of the specific areas they are over to help the hourly associates. A lot of times you will find yourself, teaching yourself how to get certain things done. In other words, there is a lack of training or willingness to learn in salary member of management.",4,Current Employee,Department Manager ,"South Euclid, OH",8/30/16,2016,8,30

Not the best company to work for.,Walmart was a good company to work for in the sense that there is always job security. Walmart is huge and will always employ thousands of people. I worked for them while I was pregnant and they were not very understanding. I had to stop labor six times because of their refusal to schedule me for less than 12 hour split shifts from the time I was seven months pregnant on. No doctor's note was accepted for my absences for doctor appointments. I brought notes and was told repeatedly they would put them on file but they wouldn't help with my absences. Management was less than understanding and frequently bad mouthed employees with other employees. The best part was meeting all the people who come through a walmart store on a daily basis. The worst part was management.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Carson City, NV",8/29/16,2016,8,29
walmart,"a dependable employeed, always showed up for work. considered a team player, worked well with others. management and security questioned me regarding production in photography and organization of photo packaging.  they seemed to doubt my professional ability.  felt they were singling me out of the team. also many debates on copyrights of professional photos.  the same managers were very lax regarding customers that destroyed wal-mart property and abused the photo policies.",3,Former Employee,"cashier, customer service ","Anthem, AZ",8/29/16,2016,8,29

Then glazed my donuts, pack everything into their boxes and bags. Put sale by dates on them and put them out on the sale floor. Clean up the bakery and do the pulling and markdown. What I've learned being in the bakery is that everything have to be time consumed. Can't do things slowly, have to manage your time to get things done before you closed for the night. Most of my co workers are very helpful and caring. The hardest part of my job is really nothing. My most enjoyable moment of the job is accomplish all my duties for the day.",5,Current Employee,Cashier/ Bakery ,"Wichita Falls, TX",8/29/16,2016,8,29

Multi-tasking fun,"As a Customer Service Manager with Walmart, I was always on the go.  There were no typical days of work, every day was a new experience.  I learned how to manage associates, run the front end of the store in a proper manner, manage customer complaints and problem solve for associates as well as customers.  When a manager higher up was needed, you called and they were there.  I had a great time working with all of my co-workers and am still friends with a lot of them.

"Fun coworkers but management was never on the same page, so rules were cloudy.","Working at Walmart gave you great pay and benefits for being retail or a grocery store, and was easy to move up.  You worked on a team so if someone didn't do their job it would effect others.  I learned that going above and beyond your job sets regulations and goals of your position you would be respected better and people will like you more.  I got along with all of my co-workers.  Management and their rules were kind of cloudy, being that rules were always changing from corporate and people did things differently.

Great work place environment and lots of friendly people to talk to during break time.,Working 7 to 8 hour shifts helping customers and keeping everything clean turned out to be not as boring.

Worst Place to work,"There is not much to say other than it takes your soul and crushes it! It is always stressful, and nothing is ever good enough for the managers.

Routine work days,"Typical day at work was routine. Get work details from MOD, retrieve shopping carts 2 - 5 times during shift, then help out at register whenever needed. Pay was decent and management was exceptional. However, co-workers were often rude and generally poor workers. The hardest part of my job was working with said co-workers due to their poor work ethic.

Not as bad a people think.,"Honestly, compared to some companies, Walmart is nothing to turn your nose up at.  They're now paying people a minimum of $9-$10 an hour across the store.  You get guaranteed breaks and lunches._x000D__x000D_I was a cashier.  I might have had an easier time because I am very patient and friendly with the customers and let rudeness roll off me as much as possible.  Obviously they want you to be as quick and efficient as possible when checking out customers while giving awesome customer service.  I did pretty good, but I wasn't nearly as fast as some cashiers.  In my position, you have a lot less ""so&so didn't do their job so it's making things harder for me"" attitude, as far as fellow workers go._x000D__x000D_Most would probably disagree with me, and it may have to do with temperament, but I think cashier is the best position in the store.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Broken Arrow, OK",8/29/16,2016,8,29

this is actually a pretty good job.,"Your typical day at walmart includes working back stock and organizing the backroom while keeping the sales floor looking good. sometimes the job can be hard to keep up with, they are understaffed. sometimes management would expect a little more than you can handle... but i always got 40 hours... they treated me and my co workers fairly... and the job was just, very secure, and very fair. thats not something i can say about my new job...",4,Former Employee,Dairy Sales Associate ,"Grapevine, TX",8/29/16,2016,8,29

Walmart Review,"Walmart is a good employer, but needs to improve in other areas of management. Their management style is not taught in college. Most management majors have no clue on how Walmart treats its people. Many people get fired from Walmart for doing stupid things such as stealing money, coming in late to work, or by having too much overtime. Today, Walmart has pay increases to its workforce, but some critics say it benefits only the new employees, not senior employees. I would give Walmart a higher rating, but the company needs to improve on how they treat the general public and their employees. When I was at Walmart, I had to pay for most of my equipment for being a cart pusher. Walmart would not pay me back for my purchase of equipment. They did not provide me a decent water supply when working outdoors in the heat. This treatment of employees concerning outdoor work is wrong in my view. I had to use my own hard earned money to purchase water and gatorade for fellow cart pushers.",1,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Ruckersville, VA",8/28/16,2016,8,28
Productive and fun experiences,"Everyday started out the same, come in, prepare the bread and donuts, then bake them off.

Easy place to work,"As a cashier I was pleased with the environment at work.  The management team had a good balance of fun and easy to talk to while still following the rules.  The shifts are all over the place and really hard to plan around, but availability can be changed.  The job itself is relatively easy as long as you can stay calm with angry customers.  You don't have to balance your own drawer or anything like that, the managers do audits throughout the day.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Hastings, MI 49058",8/28/16,2016,8,28

As with any job hard work is involved, there were long hours, and being it is Wal Mart there was a variety of customers to work with.

Nice for a while.,Seems like management goes on a rampage and targets a certain department. I have seen both of my supervisors get fired or forced to step down within weeks of each other and 5 coworkers on my team get fired in the past 3 months. They still expect us to get truck unloaded and most of that merchandise stocked by the end of our shift. It is very stressful.

productive and interesting environment.,a typical day at work for me is coming to work doing your job. of course your going to run into customers that will complain or have an attitude but he best way to resolve the issue is to remain  calm and speak politely. I love to learn new things  so a work in a new environment will be interesting. I  have had two years of management experience.

The working environment is fast paced and fun.,I enjoyed working for Walmart and would not mind working for them again. The truck team environment is fast paced and you receive a great work out.

Will Never Return,This is a great company to work for if you are just looking for a temporary job to help pay the bills or to get through school. There are plenty of options to move up within the company but the work load is ridiculous. The managers do not follow proper guidelines on FLSA and do not adhere to proper FLSA-Overtime guidelines. Was asked multiple times to stay and work late the last five minutes of my shift then told I was not allowed to go home until the job was done but I was also not allowed overtime. Was constantly being forced to stay and work 14-18 hour shifts but then told to leave early the next day to cut overtime before time would go in. You would also be coached in the office for productivity even when the managers admitted that you were 6-8 people short staffed in the department. Managers constantly made inappropriate jokes while on the clock and premise. There is a lot more about Wal-Mart that makes my blood boil. I only gave a second star because there were 3 managers that made my time with the company bearable.,2,Former Employee,Dept. Manager ,"Chickasha, OK",8/26/16,2016,8,26

Its Alright,"A typical day will consist of a nightly meeting with the team and the manager for that night. They will give you the department(s) you need to complete for the night along with any notes from the store manager or new policies. Once the meeting is over, unless paired with another associate, your work is all alone. Your freight will come on a pallet, and it can vary in size each night. You then are to go to the price checkers and scan your badge to start your task, on the task screen you are given the amount of hours to complete that task. I would always gather the things id need before ""starting"" the task. (Top stock cart and plastic bag) You then go to the pallet and down stack it according to aisle. Some tags on the boxes will tell you were they go, some do not. As you learn the department it becomes easier to separate items. Once you have filled your cart you then go find it on the shelves and stock it if the ENTIRE case will go out. (Only a few departments stray from this rule). Once you are done you take your cardboard to the baler, clean up any remaining items, and bin your overstock. (Only a few are binned daily by stockers). After the freight is thrown, then you are assigned a zoning task. And that's where you fix up the aisles, pull everything forward and take out what doesn't belong. Management can get a little stressed, but is usually understanding. Co-workers generally keep to themselves but are friendly. The hardest part of the job would be pulling pallets back at the end of the night, its just hard on the body at times when the pallets are heavy. And the most enjoyable - more...",3,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Everett, WA",8/26/16,2016,8,26

Afterwards I would sanitize the restrooms, one by one, coming back every 2 hours to check on the rooms, cleaning again if necessary, and every 4 hours to sanitize the room all over again. In between the routine, I would empty trash receptacles and take care of recycling throughout the facility. The only deviation from this routine, would be when a customer created any kind of spill or mess; or when a customer needed assistance. I didn't learn much from this job, minus the basics of sanitation. The management was very hands off, staying to themselves in a single section of the building, and difficult to find if not there. Co-workers were decent, easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job was the disrespect certain managers and coworkers gave the position.

Average Entry Level Job,"A day at this Wal-Mart is busy, I myself know how to handle 3 departments and get paid the lowest of the three. My department is usually not too busy, but the other two can get hectic. I learned how to use two different systems of registers, how to reboot 3 different systems, how to multitask between customers and management, and how to use some warehouse system programs. Management here varies from those that ignore their assigned departments, to those that help out any associate in need. Dependable co-workers are few, but not rare. The hardest part of the job is having your hard work recognized but be dismissed entirely when you want to climb up in the work ladder. The most enjoyable part is when you can see how well you attended a customer and made part of their day great.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Laredo, TX 78041",8/24/16,2016,8,24

Management often left something to be desired with most of all associates, almost no one saw eye to eye with them and they generally caused frustration among the workers and in the workplace. My co-workers and i generally got along absent any conflicts and could work together efficiently. The hardest part of the job was definitely throwing the truck, AKA putting the boxes on the belt and pushing them down, not necessarily because it was terribly physically demanding, but because on a normal day inside the truck was 100 degrees+ and no fan.

Downright evil at worst.  There is little to no communication between departments/upper management.  Absolutely miserable environment that breeds indifference and smashes any sense of self worth.  If you can tolerate the oppression, and make yourself somewhat essential to the process, you might get by.  DO NOT TAKE PROMOTIONS!  Last 3 supervisors they promoted were driven off within months.

The people at my specific location only gave a hoot about who they were flirting with, how many numbers they could get of each other or customers and who got with who that week. They constantly changed my planned out schedule, even without telling me so therefore I would get in trouble if they didn't inform me of my change.

Production fast paced,Stocking shelves nightly. I've learned to drive fork lift and use palette lifter and pulling tool. I enjoy working with my co-workers. I don't feel like there is adequate pay for the amount of work that is required to be performed nightly.

"Mostly a learning experience, since it was my first job.","Day to day we get worked and dogged really hard, unloading the truck. Expected to do our share and some of overnight's, which was insane. I worked three different positions and learned quite a bit on how a functioning company is intended to work, and picked up some good tricks for customer service. Management at my Walmart was 50/50, the good half of managers would work much harder than a standard associate, which was great, they were the leaders. The other half were very iffy, they wouldn't communicate what they were doing if it effected someone elses work, and always treated what they wanted to get done as priority #1 and demanded other busy associates to come help them instead. The co-workers there were more like 80/20. 80% being slow, ignorant people who would stop working to talk if the opportunity showed itself (which it did very often). 20% were reliable and hard workers, even if they're personality was bad. The job was never really hard, mostly just frustrating. If I had to say what the hardest thing about working there was, It would be when they terminated my original position of day stocker and moved me to be a truck unloader.",2,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Sarasota, FL",8/20/16,2016,8,20
New surprises everyday,"A typical day started off with finding a manager to find out what to do for the day. Usually I got ""Just start on this until I find something else for you to do"". It wasn't always like this. They expected me to automatically know what to do on a daily basis, but they keep pulling me away from it or starting me on something else completely and ignoring it. I also got written up for it, twice. The hardest part about this job is trying to understand management (and keep your sanity). They run based off what they're told, and they tell us what needs done, then forget that they told us and punishes us for doing it instead of our ""daily routine"". Seems like management grew up as middle school bullies and just were itching to pick a fight with anyone who looked at them the wrong way.",2,Former Employee,Cap Team 1 ,"Tucson, AZ",8/20/16,2016,8,20
Satisfactory,Work load average. I learned how to work in a public environment on a sales floor to be friendly and curtsey. Managers are honorable. Suitable co-workers.

Over all Walmart was a great company to work for,I never had a typical day at work when supervising associates. I learned how to get along with several types of personalities and learned how to be a fair manager. The hardest part of the job was coaching people for success as well has having to let someone go. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and getting to know so many of the associates.

Keeping the day fun, interesting and different each shift. Lower management was really engaging and helpful, but upper management wasn't really all that helpful or nice.

Fairly Easy Job,"The job at Walmart for Food associate is pretty straight forward you just keep the food section looking full, fronted and neat. Sometimes they will need you in other areas as well such as paper towels or bathroom, etc. but mostly just in food. The attitude towards customers is kind of poor and could be better. We don't check things for customers and we don't spend too much time making things look neat if we have other thins in the store to get done because the management doesn't really care.",3,Former Employee,Food Associate ,"San Leandro, CA",8/20/16,2016,8,20

Productive and friendly atmosphere,"The night starts with a meeting. The co-managers and assistants are usually in a good mood, making jokes. We generally work with the same people over nights, so everyone knows everyone.The work is hard on third shift, we are the stockers and clean up crew. We stock the merchandise as best and neatly as we can, zone merchandise for a professional look before we leave in the morning, we also build and maintain features; whether it is filling or changing them. Management is usually helpful when we need ideas, or help finishing up areas. Your breaks and lunches are with the click of people you enjoy being around, so we are always having conversations about our personal day(s) or cracking each other up with jokes and stories.",5,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Weatherford, TX",8/20/16,2016,8,20
Unfair environment yet a pleasure to assist customers,"The best part is assisting customers and building a repertoire. Having that close connection with customers builds with each interaction and they become a familiar face to which they become friends in the work environment. Management doesn't communicate which makes it frustrating and very uneasy in the workplace. You can see the 'click' mentality amongst Management and associates which makes it unfair and challenging to work because of apparent favoritism. Like any company you have your good and bad co-workers but it seems the ones who move ahead are the ones who Management like. There isn't much training, more like learn as you go or figure it out on your own. Expressing concerns or bringing observations known seems to be shunned even though there is an Open Door Policy.",3,Current Employee,Photo Lab Technician ,"Woodbury, NJ",8/20/16,2016,8,20

Different,"A typical day at walmart has lots of twists and turns, from all the different people you interact with from day to day. One thing you learn from working at Walmart is patients. But Ive learned how large company's order there merchandise which was interesting because it helps me do my job better by helping Walmart cut down on their shrink. Co-workers and managers are friendly depending on how there unique duties for the day effected them. The hardest part of my job is probably dealing with an irate customer, when I am having a bad day. The most enjoyable part of my job ironically is when a customer makes my job easier and thanks me for whatever assistance I lend them.",3,Current Employee,Lawn and Garden associate ,"Canton, OH",8/19/16,2016,8,19

Definitely a good introduction to the workplace,"This Wal-Mart is a great place to find an introduction into the workplace setting! They have very seasonal waves of customers and are willing to hire extra help to handle the extra workload. However, you do still feel the workload at these different times of the year which I feel makes it a great place to start working. Most employees seem to be hired during these times, so you jump into a fast-paced job with lots of other employees learning like you. After the initial rush, things will seem to slow and you can find a comfortable pace for your work days.",4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Overnight Stocker ,"Parker, AZ",8/19/16,2016,8,19

Great Overall Job,"Walmart is a great choice for hours, benefits, stability(varies per position), and flexibility for parents and college students. Other than that minor favoritism, lack of actual training for newer associates, and poor maintenance on most of their equipment makes the job very stressful.

Poor Schedule Availability,Walmart refused to give a consistant schedule to work with school hours and study time. Only Full time employees could pick their schedules.

Poor Management,"Management wasn't on the ball on things as much as they should have been. They lacked Management skills altogether. The store would be nicer and a better place to shop and work over all if Management had better communication skills and listening skills. They acted like they were team players, but, they were not. Issues would come up and they would leave it at that, unresolved or there would be a quick fix and move on. There needs to be a Team Leader and a Team that will follow through and keep in communications with one another on the same page. Also, they need to keep their Department Managers in their assigned departments so they can keep on top of their jobs and not pull them to different areas of the store or to go up and cashier when they fail to properly schedule cashiers to work at their most busy times of either the store hours or days or times of the year when there are major holidays and or events.",2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Shelton, WA",8/19/16,2016,8,19

Management wasn't the best. You would go to them with a problem, and they would either help you or ignore you. There have been a few times when I had asked for help and I have received none.

Like the work not the hours,"I love the personal interactions but the schedule demands leave much to be desired. Having the ability to teach and train those I supervise, as well as assisting customers; this is what I enjoy most about my position. I am typically scheduled 10 hour days, usually work up to 15 hours due to work load. Meal periods are spent in meetings or completing other computer related business, leaving no real break during the day to regroup. And recent changes to technology requires to be in contact or monitoring operations from home, even during days off or vacations.

"Consistent hours, great benefits, bonuses every quarter","I have been doing Dairy and Meat departments at Walmart for most of my almost 4 years there. I like the cold and it's great during the summer. It's also a good challenge because in my store is pretty busy and I have to keep moving to keep the shelves stocked. The hardest part of my job is sometimes we don't have enough help to keep everything going, so sometimes the associates like me have to step it up and sometimes do the work of two people. It's actually pretty satisfying and I feel a level of accomplishment when I can manage to power through a tough day and see that progress has been made.The management do their jobs well and will sometimes come out and help us on the floors, too. I see they will also get on a register to help out, which is good because I can see that no task is below them. I get along well with my coworkers and they are the main reason why I like to go to work. We chat and can have fun teasing each other, but at the same time, we take our work seriously and do our jobs to the fullest.I find though that as much as I have appreciated what growth and hard work I've maintained at Walmart, I feel I need a change of environment and some new job experience since I can get burned out from time to time doing what I do.",4,Current Employee,Meat and Dairy Associate ,"Lincoln, CA",8/18/16,2016,8,18

"Hard work, good pay and bad management!","Management at Walmart is shady and self absorbed, and 100% always look out for themselves.

The life of retail..,"I really do enjoy most if my days at work because I know I am working to be greater. Working for Walmart has taught me quite of bit of things even if it was unrelated to the job task at hand. I was given the opportunity to begin my journey 3 years ago as a sales associate in toys, and oh boy, to me it was the best position ever. I loved some of the managers that were over me, but there were some others that I just didn't quite care for. However, they all taught me well on how to stock the counters, zone the aisles, build presentable features, help customers find exactly what they are looking for, and also how to take down the counters to redo them for modular resets. I didn't really find anything terribly hard to do, but what made woking hard was the STRESS. This job can get really stressful at times due to the multiply tasks that almost everyone of management can ask you do.

Pretty Ok,Working for walmart was fun and a good experience. The one thing i did not enjoy was the management of the place.

"Organized, safe workplace with a sense of family and trust.","A typical day of work, as a cashier, is simply clocking in using your badge, being assigned a register, and working at that register until your break.  There's not much to it.  It's simple once you get familiar with the nature of the job.  Personally, I learned how to best balance and juggle multiple tasks when the situations arose.  The management at my Whitewater store is pretty good, and my co-workers were pretty easy to get along with.  The only difficult part of the job was having to promote corporate's silly credit card promotions that hardly any customers wanted any part of, especially considering asking about them with every customer slows down the cashiering and check out process.  Unfortunately, management had no choice but to punish us if we didn't ask customers about the credit card promotions.

"Decent place to work, but not perfect","Wal-Mart is, overall, a decent place to work. However, it is like any other company. It's main concern is making money, Nevertheless, it does offer benefits but you have to be working full-time in order to qualify for them.

Depending on which location you work at, Wal-Mart can be a fun place to work or an uncomfortable place to work. I've worked at both.  Their policy on breaks is generous and they do reward hard work.

"Overall, decent place to work.","A typical day at work at Walmart as a Department Manager would be, working freight, scanning inventory for items that were out of stock, ordering those items, finding out if the Inventory was accurate, filling the out of stock items, checking the schedules, assigning tasks to associates below me. Management is alright as long as they're doing their job. They tend to form ""clicks"" with each other, and when they do, it just gets worse. Also, their communication skills to all of the employees, are awful. But there are, however, a few managers who were AWESOME! Always did their job, always were available to help whoever was in need. My coworkers were awesome, very easy to work with. The hardest part of the job, was getting all of what needed to be done on time, it was doable, but they never gave us enough time. The most enjoyable part of my day, was working with other department managers to complete tasks, it's awesome working as a team!",4,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Watertown, NY",8/13/16,2016,8,13

Walmart ok but not ok,Walmart asks so much of the employees and they don't pay enough if u ask me. They are very strict about the attendance. Which is good but also bad because they dont care if u have a child or children. They could careless about if your sick. If u miss 9 days in a 6 or 7 month period then your fired. New hires only can miss 3 days. Too many managers want to be friends with the employees instead of managing them. So there is a lot of favoritism. If u stay to yourself and do your job then you are fine but the minute you start speaking to employees it brings drama. It's a lot of young minded employees that work there. Despite everything it's a job and its pretty fun if you stay in your own lane. You meet new people I worked there a year and a half and I only had 2 bad customer experiences.,5,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"West Palm Beach, FL",8/12/16,2016,8,12

Start your morning with how many save days there are, how much work there was to do and how well we did the day before. The managers were very nice, flexible and can talk to them about anything.

Walmart,Walmart is confused as to how many associates need hired compared to how many cashiers were needed. I was hired for electronics and spent most of my time on a register which let my other work fall behind. Managers forget to give you breaks and treat you poorly.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Leavenworth, KS",8/11/16,2016,8,11

Liked working with people and customers,The typical work day was good because you came to work checked the notice for the day and worked your assignments and helped customers where they needed help. But to be honest the management team wasn't the best. Anyone can see the favoritism between management and surtant associates. Daily jobs that are handed down from the higher management team aren't assignments that have a high priority to the business but most of the time it is only the appearance of the store that they work on. I do understand that the appearance of the store is important to bring back customers but when the customer can't find what they are looking for and than can't find someone to help them or find an associate that gives them an attitude than the customer won't want to come back even if it looks nice. Working for that Walmart has taught me to always make sure that my job is down before taking a new job and making sure that my department runs smuth throw the day. If anyone needs help in the team work around the problem and fix it.

I not only gained a lot of experience and knowledge in this company but also in the customers who came and shopped. It was also very enjoyable  because my co-workers made things so easy we were all great team players and made time fly by fast. Though there were times that were hard but with motivation and great supervisors and co-workers we all each got through the day. I remember a time a customer came with a complaint my first thought was okay i need to help her, but she was so angry even the people who tried to help her she yelled at. So i continued to say i apologize for any inconvenience  let me get my supervisor. My supervisor than came and helped the customer so easy. I then realized no matter what angle you try to approach people some just want to speak to someone with authority and assurance so they know they are getting exactly what they wanted. And i understood that because some people just want to be informed of the right information to enjoy a great shopping experience.

Tough job but rewarding pay/benefits,Very physical job you're pulling cases that weigh anywhere between 1 and 100lbs and stacking them up to 7 ft high two pallets at a time. Your work is judged on productivity percentages which were determined by how fast you finished each trip. The company highly stresses safety above all else.

They took me out of that but never gave me a reason why, then here when it gets sad, They moved me over from being a sales associate to the produce side were i had to pick out all the bad fruit and throw it all the way and on top of that, I was getting fired they just didn't know when they were going to fire me. I was in produce for about 2 weeks before I got fired. Walmart is a very good place to work at but they don't mess around, they will fire you within a second if your not following the rules.

A good pt job,Hardest part of the job is dealing with the miscommunication of the management team they can have you running around like a chicken without a head because of misdirection and doing the same task multiple  times until it's done right way it should've been done the first time.

Managers that get promoted are clueless, unprofessional, unapproachable and tend to sometimes be unethical. Most of my co-workers are very hard working folks and really put in a lot to help the company though it is Rarely acknowledged or appreciated.

"Great overall, but some problems.","I worked at Walmart, in the Vision Center, for a bit over five years, and all in all I had a great experience Most of the time the work was enjoyable; adjusting glasses, helping patients, filling out orders, that was the sort of thing I did. Now, I wasn't on the floor very often, most of the time I was was going to my job up front from the back, or vice-versa. One thing I did notice was just how understaffed they were out there. From the front end Customer Service Managers and registers to even the shelf workers, many a time was that a customer was standing in a department looking for help and I had to call someone over as I was out of my expertise. Invariably that person would be busy, and they assured me that the would be there shortly. Normally, they were, so there was no issue with customer service. In fact, customer service was rarely a problem, in or out of the Vision Center, and most people I spoke to were happy with the help, or at least satisfied with the help they received. Being understaffed wasn't only a problem with the hourly, the Management were pulled tightly as well. Walmart sells guns, and a manager is required to unlock the gun case and get them for the customer. Customers would often have to wait thirty to forty minutes until a manager was available. I liked to help patients as quickly as I could so it always made me uneasy seeing that, and being unable to do anything. I would like to add that this is not something that personnel did nothing about. Often I would walk by the personnel office to see a group of new employees going through orientation.

Work at your own Risk,"I worked as a cashier, and I didn't mind the work, cleaning, stocking, running registers and customer service desk, the problem with working there was management. They could not possibly care less about associates, making the work ethic there non - existent. I felt unappreciated, over worked, and everyone was mistreated.

"Ok workplace, company wasn't what I expected","The job itself was a pretty interesting job, a lot of different aspects to it. However nothing was ever effectively explained or taught so the extremely long 12 week training you go through doesn't even prepare you for actually doing your job. They stress being able to adapt to change but it's not change, it's inconsistency and unorganization. The managers are ok I guess, you deal with a lot of different people never really knowing who to report to. Their culture is BS. All they care about is what you do for the company, not you or your needs as a person or employee. Not understanding at all. Feel like you definitely have to fend for yourself most of the time but then it's times where they are micromanaging you. You don't always have work but you are expected to look like you have work. Co-workers are cool if you started with them but others act like they are better than you because they've been there longer and know more. It is easy to get in touch with higher ups and I guess that's good but wouldn't matter.

Day at Wal-Mart,A typical day at work at Wal-Mart would be clock in at 2 pm and check in receiving to see if anything needed stocked. Zone for an hour. Go to receiving and help unload truck. But when they where short up front I would go up front and help cashier. I had Assistant Manager Steve tell me that the Customer Service Managers liked me up front Cashiering because they could trust me. Then it would slow down up front then I would go back to help unload the truck. When there was enough people to help unload the truck we would rotate our 15 minute breaks but if there wasn't enough people we would have to wait for our breaks until the truck was unloaded. Working at Wal-Mart i learned to use a telezon kind of hand held computer and bin merchandise with it. The co-workers that I worked with willing to work and it made the time go by faster. Sometimes it was hard to go back and forth up front to Cashier because we where really short handed at times. When we where short handed in receiving some of the assistant managers would help us unload the trucks.,3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Creston, IA",8/6/16,2016,8,6

great place to work,"I love the management in and out of the pharmacy. Everyone gets along and helps out with different duties with customer service in mind.

Solid Job,"For the most part, Walmart is a good place to work. You can set what times you are available to work, and you are paid fairly well starting out at $10. In general, managers are willing to work with you, as long as there is no chance they could get in trouble for helping you. You know what is expected of you each day, and never have to stay later than scheduled (in fact, you aren't allowed to stay later). The customers are the only fall-back, as they are usually rude and condescending.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Morehead, KY",8/5/16,2016,8,5

"Great benefirts, good coworkers.","It was a standard retail job. Occasionally there were certain managers that I might bump heads with, but the discounts were worth it.

Boring place to get help by a associate.,Everyday day a work you learn something new about your work place an about the customers. You learn about how to talk to customers and make the customers to come again next time. The management really sucks at Walmart because they don't really listen to you and you do what you are told to do. the coworkers can be really mean to you according to how their day is going if they having a good day they will be nice to you and if they having a bad day they will be a a... h... to you.,1,Current Employee,Meat Department Associate ,"West Sacramento, CA",8/5/16,2016,8,5

I felt that I was getting treated fairly no matter how hard I worked.,"I felt that the company didn't care about me or my family. They make everyone except a handful of favorites work on holidays and weekends. The do not build you up they put you down. They set you up to fail. Its amazing that Walmart can afford to give away $20,000 plus in gift certificated to people on The Extreme Weight Loss Show and they have people working for them that need help. They only give the employees 10% discount and 20% during the Thanks Giving holidays.",2,Former Employee,Supervisor ,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",8/4/16,2016,8,4

Was good in the beginning. Expected to much from one person in the end.,"Started out just running register. After a while I moved to the sales floor working on stock, and ran register when needed. I started with Wal Mart in 2001 it was different back then, was really not a bad place to work then. Management was ok most of the time. I liked some of my co-workers, keep in touch with some of them. I did learn a lot when I worked there, learned how to interact with the public. Most enjoyable part was the customers, enjoyed talking to them. A lot of the customers were regulars, felt like I really knew some of them. The hardest part was toward the end, company policies had changed a lot. They wanted more and more out of a person. When I left there I was working Electronics, putting away freight in electronics plus usually at least 2 sometimes 3 other departments, and I was answering the phone all night. It was just to much and they couldn't figure out why I couldn't get it all done, Other people that they put there after me couldn't do it either. I think my being let go had a lot to do with what I was making after being there for almost 11 years.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Stock/Customer Service ,"Canton, OH 44708",8/4/16,2016,8,4
Horrible Management,"Co Managers and Store Manager were total jerks. They treat you like a piece of trash. Worked extra hours and days and still got yelled at like it was the end of the world. No matter what you do, or how hard you work, it's never good enough. I got stuck on 3rd shift. Was told for months I would be moved to days and it never happened.

I would take pride in the fact that I could make a customer smile before leaving the store. _x000D__x000D_Walmart taught me many things from working with angry customers to cash handling and stocking. One important thing that Walmart taught me was that you can have a manager that is extremely nice, but also is strict when need be. I really enjoyed that because I need someone to be strict with me, but also nice to me. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part about my cashier job was having to tell a customer that we could not help them.

I typically do the things that she has been unable to complete for the day.  I do things that are beyond my pay grade and position.  I have learned that this company takes little notice in it's hard working associates and frowns upon people very easily.  Several opportunities have come up for me to move up, but I chose not to take them due to school obligations at the time.  The hardest part of the job is working harder than other people in the department and being paid the same.

Until I moved to a different department and had a set schedule where I was able to have the same days off and able to plan for family events. however the management team disappointed me with the time delivery of the discharge from the company by waiting until the end of the day to give the news to me. A typical day was coming into work and then preforming the activities that were required as well as projects that were asked of me by the other members of management from time to time.

A typical day at work,"A typical day at work would be to clock in a few minutes before or after 10:00pm(the time I should clock in). Make it to the back in the break room for the meeting at 10:04pm. The management takes attendence to see who is here, then assigns the associates their areas for the night, talks about the previous night or any news that has come up. You should finish your freight in an timely manner, clean your area, and then proceed onto the next zone. First 15 minute break is at 12:00pm, then 2:00am is lunch (3:00am for others), lastly the last 15 minute break is at 5:00am. Before and after the last 15 minute break most associates should either be finishing up their last bit of freight or zoning; organzing their section and the store in order for it to be presentable for the morning. Once 6:51am hits you are free to clock out without losing any minutes on your hour  review or if you are still finishing a minor task you can clock out at 7:00am.",4,Former Employee,OVERNIGHT STOCKER ASSOCIATE ,"Jacksonville, FL",8/3/16,2016,8,3

Save yourself the trouble,"I see that a lot of these reviews are decent/good which is great.However for me, working at Wal-Mart was horrible. If you plan on working in the deli well expect busy weekends and a lot of stress. I was a part-time employee working 40 hours a week. My boss kept giving me and all my other co-workers these full time shifts because we were short-staffed. Mainly due to the fact that my boss refused to listen to us with the way things were going in the deli and because my boss wouldn't change our schedules when we actually needed to have days off on certain days. _x000D__x000D_For example, I had a coworker that had to go to an important doctors appointment but my boss refused to even give him a day off on that day off. Most of the time A LOT of things were over-looked and you might ask what I mean by that I mean like customers sub orders,bulk meat/cheese orders and simple things like ordering forks and spoons and condiment packages. We were always running out of spoons,forks,ranch you name it, just because my boss never ordered enough._x000D__x000D_A lot of my co-workers had children and they were practically begging my boss if they could get a day off because they spent so much time at work. To be honest going to hire up managers was pointless because even my own boss's manager wasn't that great either. So people kept quitting and when people would quit my boss would take a long time to hire new people so at times there would be literally like just only 1 or 2 people in the deli at a time because not everyone's lunches/breaks could be covered. Even managers had to jump in and actually slice meats/work - more...",1,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Albany,New York",8/2/16,2016,8,2
management,Management does not care about their workers! Great environment to work in but terrible management.

I have no problems what so ever. All I have to say mainly is it is tough and you have to be self motivated because you only have yourself to push you when it comes down to it. The employees encourage you to push yourself, but it's got to be you. The job consist of driving around on a rider with pallets on the back, and you grab boxes one by one and stack them.

I was able to interact with other employees and help customers make decisions on what was needed to be completed on their vehicles.   I learned that there were a broad range of people who utilized the Automotive Center for the services provided.  The hardest part of the job was to write up the service contract in extreme cold weather.  The most enjoyable part was the interaction allowed with other employees and the trust given to me by supervisors and fellow workers.,4,Former Employee,Service writer ,"Wichita, KS",8/1/16,2016,8,1
"Fast pace work enviorment, helpful co-workers","After we clocked in we would have a 5-10 minute report on any goals accomplished that week an discuss goals for the current week. Once report was finished, we would go to our assigned sections and begin our work. We had handheld devices that would let us know of the jobs expected of us to accomplish on that shift. Though my experience with management an other co-workers was overall good, I feel like they lacked in the importance of training. I didn't get a very good grasp on certain things like what to do if the bar codes an prices didn't match what was displayed on the shelf and other like issues. You could imagine, it made the job itself less productive, and therefore that much more difficult for me. However, I did enjoy the learning about the people who worked there for years, and gone through the changes of the store.

This was a physically demanding job.,"I originally joined the Wal-Mart remodeling crew in September of 2013. It was a physically demanding position as shelves were disassembled and moved and new merchandise was displayed. The hours were regular at 6:00 a.m. to 3:00. I worked with a good group and enjoyed the job. At the end of the 6 week remodel job, I was asked by an assistant manager to join on permanently as a cashier. I enjoyed the job and relations with customers. My problem was that I could not have any type of regular hours and had no way to plan on an income when I never knew how many hours I would be working.

There is a lot of truth in walmart being one of the worst employers.,"As with everyone, they have good points and bad points.

Enjoyed my time.,"Four years at Walmart were enjoyable. I learned so much from the management staff. After only a few months I was able to move up from an ICS team member into a Department Manager position all thanks to the management team. A typical day at work always started with an associate meeting  keeping us informed of what was going on with the store and any special things going on with other associates. My day would then go to customer service and making sure all outs were filled. If needed I would jump on a register to help shorten lines and then get right back to handling freight and counting outs for order. Whatever special projects that needed to be done in my department or helping others was always next. Always keeping our customers needs taken care of first and for most, My co workers were generally as helpful when it came to stocking and taking care of customers. I do believe the hardest part of my job was having to have a co worker written up. I would handle it as needed and keep my composure but never really liked having to perform that task.

A great place to learn the retail industry.,Set up backroom and open trucks for daily general merchandise deliveries. Assist unload crew with the unloading process.During my time with the Walmart corpoation I literallyacquired tons of information and retail knowledge. Management was knowledgeable but hesitant on sharing that knowledge. Being given task lists that were not acheivable inside of one shift. The comraderie I experienced while i was with them was second to none and actually inspired me to do my absolute best.

Productive place to work and good pay,"Receive work schedule a week in advance, so I was always prepared. Great hours and good pay, so finances were secure. Was my first job and I wish I could go back. Would go in early and sit in break room and clock in when time. Got my gear and headed straight to my post (fabric table). Would go check for returns. There was usually a cart or two filled so it would take up a lot of time, but was great for when there was nothing to do. Loved putting things back and organizing shelves. Being on the sales-floor you have many customers asking for help, but it was good talking with them and helping them made my day. Co-workers got along great and followed policies, even helped each other out. There is a lot of walking so wearing good shoes is important. There are 15 minute breaks every 3 hours. Does not seem efficient but helped take time off feet and had me energized through the day. Lockers were available and break room had a tv, charging station, and candy and water vending machines. Lunch was 30 minutes long, but for days that go over 8 hours, there was an hour lunch. I loved the experience overall. Great job if you do not mind long hours and 38 hours a week (part-time).

somewhat fun place to work.flexible hours,start by pulling all out of date produce and check every produce crate for bad product. management didn't know how to properly pick associates that could handle the work load. hardest part was when someone would quit because no body would get scheduled for an afternoon shift so when i came in the morning i would have to do double the work,3,Current Employee,Produce Associate ,"Encinitas, CA",7/25/16,2016,7,25

Would be better if issues weren't personal,If you only need to work for a year this is the place for you. Shortly after your annual review expect to be let go regardless of how well you did.

Oh yeah nobody receives unemployment after working here.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"East Point, GA",7/25/16,2016,7,25
If you enjoy working with the public then great job,I enjoyed my job at wal-mart while in Deli for the first 2 1/2 yrs and then I transferred stores and didn't enjoy it that much anymore. Due to the management in the new stores deli and the co-workers in the new store were lazy. When at my first store though I loved the management all the way up to the store manager and I loved all of my co-workers as well they were extremely hard working. The biggest Con of working at wal-mart is that you have to full time and have a year of employment before you are eligible for health benefits.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Oak Ridge, TN",7/25/16,2016,7,25
Day in the life of a Walmart Associate,"When it comes to a typical day at Walmart it isn't always typical. However when I get to work I open the photo lab fill all the orders that came in the night before and put money in the cash register. If I'm slow in photo I help out in either electronics, toys, or stationary/fabrics and crafts. As for what I've learned, well over the years they've taught me how to do price changes, binning/un-binning, I can order supplies, and I know how to manage my time. Management is always busy running around working on their own projects. Most of my coworkers are hard workers but then there's a few who could  move out of the department and no one would miss. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I know someone is leaving happy and they keep coming back for more pictures because I was so helpful the first time they came in.",5,Current Employee,Photo/Electronics Sales Associate ,"Rice Lake, WI",7/25/16,2016,7,25

Hard Worker Ready for A New Opportunity In Asset Protection,"A typical day for me insists on ensuring that everyone is working safely, as well as making sure the correct paperwork is ready for receiving high ticket merchandise as it is unloaded off of the truck nightly. I also walk the sales floor to detect any shoplifting that is going on. I also utilize the PTZ cameras to follow suspects. I pull up video for management and law enforcement. The hardest part of the job is the part that i like. I like to work and stay busy. The most enjoyable part is working with the people who make my job great.",3,Current Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Cross Roads, TX",7/25/16,2016,7,25
Order filling a horrible experience,I worked at walmart for 8 months. Got my first write up 3 weeks later for not having a poolhook and stepping on a pallet to reach a box which i was new couldnt give me a warning. Everytime i would miss a day i would always call in for some reason to them they never found a call i made to them but when i told them i could show you guys my phone history to show the calls i made which where over 10+ they werent interested to both manager and Ops. My badge never worked for the vending machines to get a pair of gloves or a pen i would tell my managers yet none did something about it but say i got you and would help me out my using there own badge but not once did they take care of my situation. On Orientation they told us steps are removed 6 months yet mine took up to a whole year i worked both weekdays and weekends i worked friday thru sunday confusing schedule sometimes weekdays managers rules were different from weekends causing me to get alot of write ups managers didnt really care about peoples situations unless you were in their level. I was starting to get tired of DC until i didnt show up for 2-3 weeks because i got all my wisdom teeth removed called in everyday when i finally went back the following week they called me to the office and wrote me up for all the days i missed which led me to a step 4 got a saftey and was terminated on the spot when i told them i had paper work they just kept nodding there heads like if they were blocking what i had to say out of there ears then decided to go along with the termination then said they would give me a call 3 weeks passed by no - more...,2,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Grandview, WA",7/25/16,2016,7,25

Ok place to start,I've meet a lot of new and good people from working here. But the advancement they promise is false. I have been working here for 3 years now and haven't even been approached by management about a different position. I qualify in every way but never confronted.

Great and productive company with room for progression.,Walmart is an amazing company which values their employees and customers.

Decent job and work environtment with dreadfully dull work and abusive and/or negligent management,"Walmart is a good job for if you just need a job. The management tends to be full of people who dont know how to treat their employees, and customers often ignore the fact that you are human to. Aside from that, the pay is really good for an entry level no-qualifications job, and the actual work is very easy",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Borger, TX",7/25/16,2016,7,25
Alright Place to work at but terrible management,Most of the day working in the Electronic section at my Walmart consists of helping customers with the activation of prepaid phones. Besides this I assist customer with buying Televisions and video games and consoles. I also help my Department Manager in making sure all of the paper work is done everyday. Management here does not like to take responsibility. If an associate asks for help most of them will tell them to go ask another manager or will say give me a few minutes and then never get back to the associate. There has also been about 4-5 months where there has been no store manager. The best part about the job is my coworkers.,4,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Flagstaff, AZ",7/25/16,2016,7,25
they do not take care of their people,"a typical day consists of customer service, stocking items, inventorying incoming products, intenventorying items, maintaining outdoor & indoor products. with no help of replacements, there are only a few people that worked the rest sit on their butts and get paid the  same as I did but I worked in the lawn & garden area with no ac no extra breaks with the 110 temps. like an employee is suppose to ...with pupose.Management was there if there was an incident or accident otherwise they were never to be seen.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Olathe, KS",7/24/16,2016,7,24

Average retail work.,"The job was nothing more than that, a job. I would get to work early and clock in 5 minutes early or so, then head to a register. The only thing I can say I really learned was from observing other cashiers, the managers rarely stand up for the employees when they are right.

Good starter job,This is a company that has been in business for many years but they currently do not treat their lower store level employees fairly. If you are not apart of the management team then you are being treated poorly and your complaints fall upon deaf ears. The benefits could be much better and unless you have the right actions and connections you do not have any opportunity to advance in the company. Hard work and dedication mean nothing.,1,Current Employee,Accounting Associate ,"Mayfield Hts, OH",7/24/16,2016,7,24

The worst company in every way for anybody with a soul to work....,"When you work for this company as an hourly associate and are actually a good hard working employee that really truly makes a point of doing your job correctly to the T it will NOT help you advance, in fact it will put a target on your back to be treated like garbage, borderline being tortured by management. Everything having to do with being treated decently working there is based solely on your rank in the worst popularity contest you'll ever experience. It's 1,000 times worse than high school in that aspect. Laziness and not doing things corectly or even really trying to especially per policy (which they do EVERYTHING possible for being able to look up and read any policy EVER an impossible feat) is what gets people recognition and what moves them up in this company as long as you make sure the store manager is your best friend that's the only thing your treatment and any opportunities to move up in the company will be based on and nothing else. They will find any way to do whatever they want to you and it somehow still be legal, just because you refused to sign the papers to relocate you to a lower position and give u a pay cut it doesn't matter they'll authorize it anyways because it was ok'd and accepted by someone that wasn't you on the computer.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Ridgecrest, CA",7/24/16,2016,7,24

Fun Workplace but annoying management,"Honestly walmart was a great way to assist customers especially in the electronics department. The downside was that management wasn't as efficient as possible focusing more on return carts rather than actually helping customers, which in turn can cause customers who aren't fully educated about purchases to be making more returned products.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Country Club Hills, IL 60478",7/23/16,2016,7,23
Worked here off and on for awhile. AVOID unless you realyl need work.,Walmart is your typical retail position. Work when they tell you too and since they are so cheap and don't want to hire a full crew you are pulled to other areas of the store. If you want a job where you feel valued and appreciated do not work for this company. They only care about the customer and not their workers. If you work in a food area and you have to miss? It is held against you. (Guess what walmart this can and potentially will violate health code laws and standards) And if you have open availability don't even mention to management that you can't work a scheduled shift or else you would be stranded due to not being able to get a ride home from a friend family member or public transit. They won't care. Overall i'd say avoid unless you absoultely need a job.,1,Former Employee,Electronics Associate ,Utah,7/23/16,2016,7,23

Not My Favorite,"Walmart is a good start up company, as well. However, the reason I left this job was because of the work environment. Despite trying to become friends and open to many of the other cashiers there, they closed me out like I was an outcast. I wasn't in a great work environment. Given only part time, I worked at least 40 hours a week. Many wouldn't complain over this, however this was my first real job so I wasn't ready for full time hours.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Denison, TX",7/22/16,2016,7,22
Working at WalMart made me understand I wanted a career in Banking,"A typical day included helping customers in the electronic section -- where i was recognized for customer service more than any other previous employee.  Management varied:  sometimes they were helpful and informative; other times, they were stressed and of little to no help.  the hardest part was working solo with no input or support from anyone else._x000D__x000D_The most enjoyable part was working with some of the customers and the satisfaction I got from helping.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Flemington, NJ",7/22/16,2016,7,22

If there are changes in the routine or processes the training staff is amazing and ensures the employees are up to speed. Management is available to answer questions and are happy to help as needed. Co-workers are polite and eager to learn and assist one another to ensure the job gets done beyond expectation. The hardest part of the job is keeping busy while there is a limited amount of customers; however, there's always something the managers are happy to assign to fill the time.

Great Job security,Love my job but there is so much lack of communication between Management. This honestly would be an amazing job if some Managers would look at the point of view as a Business perspective and not just something to make themselves feel and look good about.  You can't skip work steps to make yourself look better.

On a typical day at work, Wal-mart is never the same. Everyday is always different. What I have learned working at Wal-mart is time-management, being organized, multitasking, how to treat customers and employees professionally. The Management at Wal-mart is a pretty steady team.

"Good for an entry-level job, not as a career choice.","I'll start by saying that working at Walmart isn't the worst place to start one's work experience; decent starting pay, good benefits, and an honestly great vacation system. However, Walmart is only worthwhile as a career if you can become a manager. If you are just an average associate, be prepared to have no say in how things are run, working hard for little to no recognition, and basically being stuck in one department for years at a time.",3,Current Employee,Deli Sales Associate ,"Fargo, ND",7/22/16,2016,7,22

so/so to work for,Until February 2016 I was really not liking my job very well. Then I started at the neighborhood market and the moral went through the ceiling.

Poor management skills,Large store with little help from the overnight managers. They were always in the office and left training up to other associates that weren't helpful or annoyed to be stuck with a new employee and often complained.

"Stressful place to work, with poor moral, work ethic, and management","A typical night working with Walmart starts with a meeting when you clock in, then it's off to work. You have to pray that the equipment you need is readily available, which it rarely is. You then have to hope that the equipment you found, works properly, which it rarely does. Co-workers often have the mentality of ""its not my problem, why should I care"". Morale is low all around, especially when the management that you work for is poorly organized, misinformed, and downright rude.

Walmart review,A typical day at work would begin at 2 p.m. with 7+ people pulling merchandise off of a freight truck and sort it out onto pallets. This usually takes 1.5-2.5 hours depending on the pace of the associates and the amount of freight on the truck. After we sorted the entire truck we would go to an hour lunch. After lunch we would take the freight we pulled off the truck and pull it's right place and stock the shelves. We would do this until 9:30 p.m. with two 15 minute breaks during that time. After 9:30 we would take the remaining freight and pull it out to the sales floor with pallet jacks.,3,Former Employee,Customer service ,"Moberly, MO",7/15/16,2016,7,15

I'd take them back and then start putting them where they belong. My co workers were the best, they were all so helpful in anything I wasn't sure of and taught me alot. I learned how to cut fabric and print out the price label, how to zone great, and how to help customers more. The hardest part was being put out on the floor not knowing a thing, this is why I was so thankful for my co workers.

The stress is overwhelming. You have to make production every week or you get written up. Most of the employees suck up to the supervisor so they can get good trucks and make production.

They didn't train properly or explain to you when you are in your interview that there might be days that you have to work sixteen to eighteen hour days and then  go home sleep for four or five hours and come back in to do it all over again. They tell you when you are hired that you are hired for four ten hour days but that defiantly wasn't the case. Co-workers at wal-mart some were great they would help and answer questions that you may have and then there were others who were there to help themselves and that was it. The hardest part of my job was learning how to do my job properly without proper training in hopes that you didn't get wrote up and fired before you actually knew how to do your job properly. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to just go in and work do my ten hours for that day and go home.,3,Former Employee,fork lift driver ,"Bedford, PA",7/14/16,2016,7,14

"Employees made the job enjoyable, management killed that.","I loved being able to spend time with my fellow employees. Our store was always kept clean and organized. My main problem was with the management, in the beginning they would tell us that we could come to them for anything and that they will work with us on our schedules, but when something came up they would say that there is nothing that they can do and then we'd get in trouble if we had to miss work. That is just one example.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Devine, TX",7/10/16,2016,7,10

Large impersonal company with with great growth potential,"As the overnight support manager my crew was responsible for stocking the incoming freight and cleaning the store before it opened in the morning.  I gained great respect for the hard working employees that kept the large store running at minimal wages and much disconnect between their shift and management.  Being a very large company I saw how little authority management had even within their own store.  The corporate office micromanaged every aspect of the store making it hard to meet employee's needs or help them advance.  There are many hard working individuals in the store I worked at that I respect and applaud for their work ethics.

Corporate policies are horrible.,I worked for several Walmart stores in the six years I worked for Walmart.  The first store nearly all of the management team walked out because corporate would not allow them to raise wages to be more competitive with the local job market.  The final store I worked for we had a great team and were getting a slightly failing store turned around and cleaned up.  Then corporate stepped in and did a restructuring bringing in management that had shown to not be able to handle their responsibilities the reins and undoing a years worth of massive forward strides.,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Portland, OR",7/9/16,2016,7,9

I ordered items for the shelves and kept them full.  I had no authority over any employee, hiring, firing disciplining, or over any of the systems in place for running of the deli, but was definitely the go-to person when something wasn't running correctly.  I am very conscientious about my job and wanted it to succeed.  The policy at Walmart was to never give overtime, but my job required so much more; I would come in two hours before, stay at least an hour after, but punch in at the correct times just to get some things done that needed to be done.

I have learned so many things from working at Walmart, pretty much any type of skill that one could think of, its not just retail and putting things on shelves it is so much more. But I see Walmart as a job that is needed, but not a career. The management team varies, there is such a high turnaround with managers its hard to comment on the team.

Very easy and fun work environment,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was very chill and relaxing. I would help customers, maybe build a grill or two, water the plants if they needed it and zone the department. I didn't really learn much other than some customers can be downright irritating. The management there was a little worrisome, some knew what they were doing but others didn't and when you told those managers the way it should be done, they would argue with you and tell you to do it their way anyways which, in turn, would fall apart and you'd do it the correct way once they realized their way wouldn't work. My co-workers were fun if a bit lazy. We all worked for Wal-mart and we knew what that meant, so they just didn't try most of the time. The hardest part was when the holidays came around and you had to redo the seasonal aisle but that was also the most enjoyable part because you got to see all the cool new stuff be put up.",4,Former Employee,Garden Center Associate ,"9599 Sheridan Blvd., Westminster, CO",7/6/16,2016,7,6

WalMart is a world of its own. There are very nice and hard working people who work there.,"Walmart is a high stress, fast pace, and a job that is not appreciated by many. I've learned what hard work was. Management as a whole was great and wanted to see you succeed, but not all. There are two types of co-workers at Walmart. Either they are hard workers or they are there to connect with friends and ignore job duties or the customer. The hardest part of the job is doing my responsibilities and everyone else's. The most enjoyable is working with responsible co workers.",3,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,Minnesota,7/6/16,2016,7,6

I pretty much had fun with management, but sometimes the things they said or did didn't really make a whole lot of sense business wise.  They upset a lot of employees and customers.  The hardest part was working in the garden center, but it was also the funnest, because we got to work outside a lot.  It was hot, the items were heavy, but it does give you a good workout.

I did not learn a thing from the CBL training and got all of my knowledge from the fellow people that worked around me, once again not the management. The typical day was a bunch of redneck losers who walked in thinking they were the master race, and mixed in were some mean old people who had nothing better to do than to tell the world their life sucked and ours should too. Also if you could not figure things out quick enough you would be cussed at, or have your job threatened by the customer, which usually was a blow off since I was pretty much the main guy on my half of the store.

They do not know what it means to have great customer service, they change your schedule without knowing. The open door system is janky. Typical day at work is not the right prices on items more than 20% of the store. They fire people at our most vulnerable times. Only up to 5-6 people unloading a truck when we need at least 10 and up to get the job done in a timely manner. Hardest part of the job is when you supervisor blames you for cluttered lines when you dont have the jurisdiction for a key turn or actions codes. VERY UNORGANIZED.

Wal-Mart Family: Take it or Leave it.,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was overall easy and allowed for movement in the company. I learned many different positions from cashier to customer service to sales. The management was a hit and miss. Some of the staff on management were fun and enjoyable while others seemed to hate being there so they made it miserable for the employees. Hardest part of my job was how much was expected from me all at one time. I could be in the middle of 20 different things, but if one other thing came up and I didn't stop what I was doing to do that one thing it would make the rest of the shift hard.

The way management works there isn't fair, there is a lot of favoritism towards people who've been there longer or have family members who are part of management. My co-workers are amazing,we all get along so well and really help each other out. The hardest part of the job is not being able to stick up for ourselves when customer is yelling at us and threatening us,and the managers don't do anything to back us up on certain things.

My day consisted of opening the Connection Center and taking an inventory of the available stock. I checked the computer for price changes and possible new bundles or deals that each company represented began. I took the continuing quizzes that each company provides on new technology on each telephone, computer, and camera. My manager would make sure I put up the correct displays and the pricing was corrected accurately. My manager had three departments: Electronics, Photo and Connections. I had to know how to develop photos and change out machines, How each television worked plus how to set it up for different needs, Plus my department. I had one co-worker who knew the department and countless others for the other two departments. The telephone and satellite companies did not agree with cross training for the other two departments because of sensitive information so it was just the two of us.

Some days are incredibly busy and some days are incredibly slow, so I've learned about prioritizing what's most important. _x000D_Management could be worse. It's difficult to use a blanket term to describe management because working for a large company means there are a lot of co-managers. My manager specifically was always willing to compromise, but it was difficult to actually get things taken care of with him because he was always busy and it was always ""I'll get back to you on that."" _x000D_The people I worked within my department changed constantly because people were quitting and being replaced sometimes within a month of you meeting them. In the last few months with Walmart, I worked with a lot of difficult people that were just looking for easy money, so they had to be directed and told exactly what to do and I often found myself cleaning up their messes (it's incredible to me how messy of workers people can be). But at the same time, I've worked with a couple really great people. I've worked with a huge variety of people in my time here._x000D_The hardest part of the job is usually the people.

The worst part is the management. Many of them are inept at their jobs, and often forget they either allowed you time off, or authorizing paid overtime.

stressful and undesirable workplace.,"A typical work day at Walmart is generally unpredictable. The amount of work done every day was questionable at best. There were days where I could come in to my department and see no freight and a clean service desk, however, more often I would be greeted by pallets and a very messy service desk all which I would have to fix prior to started my actual duties. I was able to develop a lot of skills at Walmart from simple stocking to marketing merchandise. The management at Walmart was rather disappointing. While I was an overnight stocker the majority of higher level management was very detached, most of the overnight crew only knew of the assistant managers on overnights and the store manager. I specifically remember waving at a day manager when my shift was over and theirs was starting, the manager didn't even acknowledge. However, when promoted I was introduced to the management team and thrown into the position with virtually no training or direction. I was only able to learn through questioning other department managers as to what was required of me. I did make it as a department manager but it wasn't easy. The co-workers I had on overnights were generally lazy and it was nothing for me to stand out from the crowd as a harder worker. The day shift employees were more experienced and some were very good workers. I only met one other person who was willing to actually work as hard as me though. He no longer works there either.

Granted, you can advance very quickly but you don't have to be a strong associate to do it. There was a time that I loved my job but they quickly rip that away from anyone.

I'm all for times when discipline is needed but not so much that you learn not to trust them. I liked most of the management team but never trusted them for that reason. Rules are very needed but you have to learn to talk to your associate and not make them feel and outcast. The pay was good and for the most part so were the managers.
