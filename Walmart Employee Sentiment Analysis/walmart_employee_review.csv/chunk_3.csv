"Cool coworkers, atrocious management and scheduling ","I am I part time highschool student, I worked around 32+ hours a week during summer, I’ve had to sign 3 availability forms because they kept changing my schedule without my permission, management and coaches pick and choose favorites and contribute an extremely toxic work environment. There have been numerous times where I’ve been tasked with a 2-3 person job alone due to bad scheduling and then “coached” because I couldn’t complete other job task’s I wasn’t trained to do or told about. Waited 3 months for a 10% discount that doesn’t work on half the merchandise in the store. ",2,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Arroyo Grande, CA",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Co-Workers Are What Make You Stay,"I'm not sure of the benefits because I didn't use them, but working here was okay. Not great, just alright. It gets stressful during holiday season. You often have to do more than you're asked and they don't like overtime - even though on most days, you have to.",3,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Houston, TX",9/4/22,2022,9,4
They are not truthful,Walmart claims they never retaliate and that is a lie. If management doesn’t like you they will make your life miserable. You never have a life outside of work and expected to work 50* hours and you end up making less then a team lead or regular associate by the time they make overtime. ,1,Current Employee,Assistant Store Manager/Store Manager ,"Washington, MO",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Difficult but easy ,The customers can make an easy job insanely difficult to deal with. I have been threaten on multiple occasions and depending on the manager on duty they may or may not take it seriously ,4,Former Employee,Door Host ,"Durham, NC",9/4/22,2022,9,4
No competition ,"This is the only super store in this town so it’s constantly loaded with customers , who will come to the store even in bad conditions So you will never not be working.",3,Current Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Walterboro, SC",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Co-workers are great. Management only concerned about themselves.,Employees are overworked and under paid which doesn't seem to concern management. Management only cares about their bonuses and nothing else. Rude customers.,1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Crystal Lake, IL",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Bad,"Disrespectful management . Store leader will drive by on off hours and take pictures of things that look slightly dirty. Must be a sad life at home, and definitely at work.",1,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Mentor, OH",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Too much work for too little pay,"While the pay at walmart is above the average for a retail job, the amount of work expected is sometimes not worth the extra money. Little to no training for new employees as well.",2,Former Employee,Associate ,"Fort Collins, CO",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Productive ,Employees aren’t always respected as employees The work load is too much Basic training Management is chaotic Most enjoyable part was making friends with coworkers They have a lot of benefits but not all of them are meant to reward you ….. some of them were just to push an agenda ,3,Former Employee,Store Associate ,"Fort Smith, AR",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Really hated working for Walmart,"I have nothing positive to say - I was hired off the street and treated as such. You have to fight for lunches and breaks, then when you let it go, it's suddenly your fault when you didn't go to lunch on time. Management was horrid, coworkers don't care, and you can't even blame them. I was left and forgotten in the garden center constantly with no other coworkers, security, nor door hosts, no air conditioner in florida 100°+ weather and rarely able to go 'take 5' when it gets too warm... I could go on for hours. ",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Team Member ,"Jacksonville, FL",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Management is terrible ,"They do not know how to communicate with employees about time off and points. Management honestly doesn't care about what their employees are going through, they only ""care"" about you when you call in ",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Cameron, MO",9/4/22,2022,9,4
disrespect and lies ,"they say theirs  an open door policy,  theirs not. I attempted to work for walmart on a couple of occasions. one of those I was told not to come back until I had the proper clothes.  the other I was having a personal problem,  they did not want to hear about it. and their is other issues with this store. I guess having anxiety is a problem for walmart.",1,Former Employee,Stocking Associate ,"Gillette, WY",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Productive and fun work,"I would go back and work for Walmart again if it was a neighborhood market. I tried working at a super center, but the managers…gave me such anxiety..",4,Former Employee,OGP Associate ,"Jacksonville, NC",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Could be better,"Most of the time coaches and team leads are great. Manager has a god complex. When times are slow there's not much to do but you still have to look busy. If you can't fake it they'll give you other work to do. Co workers are mostly good at helping each other out. I came here to be a cashier, not to stock items or be a door checker. They need to hire more people so cashiers aren't doing jobs that aren't really ours to do. We're always getting new people but still somehow always understaffed? Makes no sense. When you need helpnand use action codes to call someone over they never respond. Your only option is to walk to them and flag then down. You have phones and TC's, pay attention to them or hire more people who can. I don't like getting yelled at by a customer because someone else is taking too long to do their job getting to me. When I was first hired on I was not trained very well and had to figure a lot out for myself once thrown onto my own numbers. Still just kind of winging it sometimes. Might give it a month or two and move onto to other things.",3,Current Employee,Could be better ,"Schertz, TX",9/4/22,2022,9,4
toxic work environment,Team leads would make inappropriate jokes on an almost daily basis. I had multiple team leads and other associates make jokes about suicide and not just the ohhh I want to die kind. like thought-out jokes meant to include it. I had a team lead tell me I look like how they feel. basically telling me I look like terrible. I had one make fun of the way I talk and mimic me. If you have never read Nickle and dimed give the chapter about Walmart a read before you work here I found that even though that experience is from over 20 years ago it is still relevant to the company. They give you certain things to keep employees from unionizing but keep other rules in place so that they can fire anyone at any time they want if they step out of line. I saw this happen many times while I worked there. If for whatever reason you do decide to work at Walmart don't talk about management to anyone you will get fired for it.Departments are extremely understaffed and they don't cross-train people so there is normally no one to help you and you are just expected to do the job of multiple people without any help or extra pay.,1,Former Employee,Associate ,"North Adams, MA",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Walmart sucks,"As a janitor, I was the lowest on the rung, even though they cannot function without a janitor. I felt that way when I was there. I was denied advancement for no reason. The manager's lie, and apparently hate janitors, wanting us to go above and beyond for garbage pay. Constantly micromanaging and being overly critical when you're work isn't ""perfect"". Kinda hard to do any job with a several managers breathing down your neck.",1,Former Employee,Maintenance ,"Gainesville, GA",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Great team to work with  love this company.,I'm been in this company 10 years and it great .You will learn a lot  learn different skill s.Manager are nice to me .Benefits are great I feel like we are a dream team.,5,Current Employee,Modular Team Associate ,"Niles, IL",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Productive and fun place to work ,I loved working at Walmart. Communicating and learning more abt the customers. Everyone seemed like family. They always gave me another chance in btw personal things in my life. ,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Longview, TX",9/4/22,2022,9,4
It was about what you’d expect ,"The pay was pretty good, especially for the job you’re doing. I did overnight stocking in the Summer before I went back to school. Go workers were cool. Job was fair. I enjoyed seeing different customers ",5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Valparaiso, IN",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Unorganized,Very unorganized and under staffed. Almost impossible to get management to listen to concerns.Can be very disrespectful at times. I enjoy working with people that put equal amounts work and respect into the company.,3,Current Employee,Delivery Driver ,"Morgantown, WV",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Terrible  mgt,"I loved  working for walmart  Inc. But the store I worked at #556 in waycross  ga. Is not a good place to work, mgt is terrible to say least. Employees are so young n not made to do their jobs and the older good employees are fired over points or frivolous  things while others that do nothing  and not show  customer service to customers are kept  on. It's a very  prejudice place to work.",2,Former Employee,Front End Assistant ,"Waycross, GA",9/4/22,2022,9,4
Walmart does not care about employees,"I worked for Walmart for 5 years. I had amazing managers, specially my last 2 years. I had nothing but respect for those 2 store managers. However, when it comes to Market Managers, they don't care about hourly associates or salary employees. They don't understand the struggle we have at the stores. All they see are metrics, and expect us to get there with little hours and no support. They do little to no training, most of the stuff you'll have to figure it out by yourself. You work long hours 9 to 12h, sometimes without a break or lunch. Market puts a lot of pressure on OPS and Store Managers; which end up giving you no life outside of Walmart.My recommendation is don't trust no-one, and make sure you work for the right people.",1,Former Employee,Ops Manager ,"Woodland, CA",9/3/22,2022,9,3
"good management, good break periods, flexible changing from full- to part-time","management and HR are good people and understanding. co-workers will try to answer a question and help out when they can. job instructions and rules are clear. scheduling is automated, so you never end up working past your scheduled hours.  ",5,Current Employee,Fulfillment Associate ,"Chippewa Falls, WI",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Very busy and always working hard ,"Greet the customers and help them, cleaned my area, organise it before I started my work day cooked, cleaned helped customers with orders. Stock merchandise and help the bakery Department. The hard part of the job is not having enough help. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.",5,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Vista, CA",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Mixed bag depending when and where you work.,"Walmart started out as a very promising company when I started out. Most people worked hard and management was full of spirit and encouragement. However, as managers changed, and friends of managers were promoted over other, including night crew's dealers...you can guess what direction that went it.  Walmart almost course corrected and reformed their promotion program to outside the local stores decision, moving interviews to specialized hiring.  After being promoted through that system, things almost look promising again, but there was too many of the old managers running around. Combine that with the crazy decision to axe almost all the upper management jobs and the sabotage between managers blew up like wildfire.Depending when and where I worked it was either the best job or the worst job.",1,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Encinitas, CA",9/3/22,2022,9,3
The job is easy but the company is…… terrible,The job is easy. There’s no doubt about it. Simple replenishments and occasional putaways if working in outbound. My issues came from the company as a whole. They had made major benefit changes including not paying out holidays. My major issue and the reason I left was the major bill they had left me when they didn’t pay my tuition. They were supposed to pay 100 percent of it at only 14 dollars cost to me. That’s 3000 dollars I’m never getting back. Overall terrible company to work for and would not recommend.,3,Former Employee,Reach Truck Operator ,"Pendergrass, GA",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Okay job,"Not paid for the amount of work you do. Sometimes they’ll make you do a team lead’s job without the pay. Draining environment, Repetitive. Sometimes hard to deal with management. Easy job but has its down ",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Poway, CA",9/3/22,2022,9,3

Okay job but many fake people ,I liked working at Walmart job is reasonable with pretty good pay but my negative about this job is that management act like they care about you but in reality they don’t and they would be snakes.,3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Santa Maria, CA",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Corporate job. ,The days are long and depending if you work days customers are rude. Management support is almost nonexistent. Toxic work environment all around. Management will definitely have favorites. ,1,Current Employee,Overnight Maintenance Associate ,"Center, TX",9/3/22,2022,9,3
"Hard work, nice pay, not for everyone","If you enjoy demanding, fast, and hard work this is a good job for you. Hours lack a bit but other than that if you think you’re up for it give it a go.",5,Current Employee,Order Filler ,"Wintersville, OH",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Horrible ,Horrible treatment of workers they don’t care for u or a balance in ur life. They will work u to ends! Then add more work!! What I learned was truly higher ups and management treats u awful!,3,Current Employee,Grocery Clerk ,"Wheeling, IL",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Pharmacist are the last on the totem pole,I prefer floating than working as a staff member.  I also liked the benefits package. Helping customers was great opportunity and experience. I do like that they actually have more than one pharmacist on a shift.,3,Former Employee,Pharmacist ,Mississippi,9/3/22,2022,9,3
Hectic and poorly managed,"I worked there almost 3 years I worked in three different departments which is the only way to really get a raise there. The morale among employees is non-existent, help from management also non-existent, customer interaction horrendous and working conditions lacking in basic needs.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Chino Hills, CA",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Good,"Good pay, but too stressful at times. Can move up if you want to, but you have to put in the effort to do so. Benefits are decent, some good changes are happening that will be beneficial.",2,Current Employee,Area Manager ,Tennessee,9/3/22,2022,9,3
I work with a lot of people and I am a people person ,"walmart is like any retail place and retail is retail you get good customers and bad customers, it is your duty to yourself on how you deal with it. I like my managers on a personal level. I would like to advance in the company. Walmart is okay to work for.",3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Miamisburg, OH",9/3/22,2022,9,3
They can't keep workers at walmart herriman,My manager was not fair. He arbitrarily gave me points to cause me to be fired. I was so frustrated by the way he was treating me. So I gave my leave notice before he fired me.I couldn't take the frustration and stressful work environment even though the payment was satisfying.,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Herriman, UT",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Review,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart for the most part. The employees were nice and helpful. There was a couple managers who I did not adore but most of them are not there anymore. The job was fairly easy and the customers were nice. Overall, I rated it a three out of five",3,Former Employee,Fuel Associate ,"Lynchburg, VA",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Watch who you talk too,Watch what you say and who you say it too. Words and actions can and will be used against you in the wrong contexts.  Some team leads and managers are great and others are awful and vengeful.,2,Former Employee,Multiple Positions ,"Berea, KY",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Great Start for being a recruiting coordinator,Walmart is a great company to work for.  This company is always changing.  Like any other company you will have to learn and adjust. There's always something you can lear. ,4,Current Employee,Senior Recruiting Coordinator ,Remote,9/3/22,2022,9,3
Good,"Good job, days went by fast. We unloaded trucks, stocked the shelves in grocery and general merchandise and helped customers locate items when on the sales floor.",5,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Mountain Grove, MO",9/3/22,2022,9,3
It’s was good,"I enjoyed working there, it had great pay, I liked what I did as my job title and accountabilities. The managers were supportive and nice and continue to support me in my future",5,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"New Richmond, WI",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Not the greatest place to work,"Management is lazy, makes you do ask of the hard work. Got fired for being sick and missing days, although I had a doctors note excusing me. If you wanna work excessively for horrible pay, then you should definitely work at Walmart.",2,Former Employee,Remodel Associate ,"Hemet, CA",9/3/22,2022,9,3
The people,While it's easy to find good people to work with and and I personally have been very lucky I hear an awful lot about big personalities making problems for other people and when it comes to communication Walmart is terrible whether it's the managers we deal with or the people above,3,Current Employee,Cart Associate ,"Wabash, IN",9/3/22,2022,9,3
"Great workers, poor leadership.","Walmart's pay is low, their supervisors at my location are hit or miss. One is good, one is ok, one has a nasty attitude, one is outright crazy... So yes, it's hit or miss... Thank god most employees are great... There is a general ""Plantation"" mentality atmosphere while working there.",2,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Pensacola, FL",9/3/22,2022,9,3
The people ,"Coming to work at 6806 from 1998 -2020, this is a small town so they have very little turn over.They watch your kids grow up finish school. ITS FAMILY",5,Former Employee,Dispatcher/Customer Service ,"Cullman, AL",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Fun co workers and an accommodating Store manager.,"Walmart is for people who are strong,  hardworking and ability to endure. It’s basically not for someone who has family and bills to pay. Their work schedule is not fixed, they messes with one’s schedule and job description. ",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Columbia, MD",9/3/22,2022,9,3
"It's a Walmart, you get what you expect most of the time","Stocking is probably one of the easiest things you can do for a job. You take thing out of box, you put thing on shelf. If thing no go up then thing overstock. It's that simple. Some people don't seem to understand that and working with them is frustrating. Managers are a mixed bag ranging from store lead material to ""why are you in this position"".",2,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Olathe, KS",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Boring ,"Idk what to say, it’s easy and sometimes you get into it with people. But ion really prefer it, it was a great company but not for me lasted a year ..",4,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Austin, TX",9/3/22,2022,9,3
Its Walmart,Retail never changes nor will it. Can't find the correct associate for anything nor do they help in finding said associate. Upper management never gets their hands dirty i.e. working freight except for one or two. Half of the team leads are on a power trip for some reason. Company works the best workers into the ground and doesn't reward them but then thanks the associates that don't do anything except stand around and talk to them.,3,Former Employee,GM Sales Floor ,"Cornelia, GA",9/2/22,2022,9,2
Work can get pretty repetitive but the job was okay,With the right coworkers the job was good. 40+ hours which was great. Paid time off system was simple and easy to use. But dealing with some managers was difficult.,3,Former Employee,Digital shopper ,"Buffalo, NY",9/2/22,2022,9,2
Productive and fast-paced ,"Honestly, I haven't came across any rude and out-of-pocket managers as of yet. Some co-workers, however, are in a mega rush and will get mad at anyone fast, but otherwise no complaints. Some customers are on a high horse, but that's everywhere you go. The workload for order pickers isn't too rough, and backup is always provided when slammed. As long as you're not one of the slowest pickers, like probably bottom 5/100 workers, you likely will never get talked to about your speed by management. Benefits are better than most companies provide. Good insurance, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Delta Dental, some free education through Guild as well as Live Better U, free Paramount+ and Walmart+ memberships, slighly faster access to preordering items, and the employee discount is a lot better than many competitors try and give. Within my first week of work I already have 3 total PTO hours. My last employer got me 12 PTO hours in 6.5 months of work. Honestly a great job for getting on your feet, and a great job for steady work and set scheduled availability. ",5,Current Employee,Order Picker ,"Chippewa Falls, WI",9/2/22,2022,9,2
"Imagine the building is on fire, the fire department arrives and starts washing the windows. That's Walmart.","I enjoyed the job at first but once the honeymoon phase ended I realized the terrible management, bad pay and horrible customer base made it suck really bad. They demoted all of their department managers and began making team leads which there are far less of so the store is often incredible understaffed with departments never having the people they need. They demoted the department managers to cut down on payroll then they increased the pay by a very small amount to show that, ""Walmart cares about you!"" I literally got a raise working there after this big grander speech about how Walmart wants to, ""Put me first,"" the raise was from 11 dollars an hour, to 12 dollars an hour. I was out in the freezing cold pushing carts by hand because the mule was constantly broken, I worked often alone most days with the parking lot being completely and utterly destroyed with carts everywhere because I simply couldn't keep up.",2,Former Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Escanaba, MI",9/2/22,2022,9,2
Hard labor ,Overnight stocking during holidays wasn’t as fun as I thought. Sometimes people wouldn’t show up so management would expect you to fully stock 2 and sometimes even 3 departments alone. If you didn’t finish they would suggest being coached. Pay was good though.,4,Former Employee,Seasonal Overnight Stocker ,"El Paso, TX",9/2/22,2022,9,2
Just a paycheck,"Not a bad job, not a good job. If you do what is expected, everything’s fine, but don’t expect any one to care if you are sick, they still want you to work.  ",3,Former Employee,Stocker ,"East Peoria, IL",9/2/22,2022,9,2

Decent. Coworkers are great management is eh,Most of the coworkers are amazing and even in other departments. Some act like they are still and middle school and like to start stuff. Most of management is on a high horse and views you as replaceable. They hire people without looking into them more and when they want to fire them they can’t because it’s considered discrimination.,3,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Greenwood, IN",9/2/22,2022,9,2
Not a great company to work for,Over the years I’ve been with the company it’s gotten progressively worse. The way they treat workers is appalling and then they have the audacity to complain about a high turnover rate. Now from my experience it seems to only be the store that I worked at because I’ve heard decent things about other stores but the majority of the time most Walmart’s are relatively the same. ,1,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Miami, FL",9/2/22,2022,9,2
Good company loved it,"I really loved working at Walmart until I had to fire people, or write people up who I didn’t feel deserved it. Otherwise it is a great place to work . I hate it that I cannot work there anymore .",4,Former Employee,People manager ,5 walmarts in NE Ohio,9/2/22,2022,9,2

Walmart is the biggest joke. Management is horrible!,I’ve been at walmart for three years now and it’s by far the most horrible job you could have. The whole place is a joke! I’ve had the worst experience,1,Current Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Pell City, AL",9/2/22,2022,9,2
Don’t do it.,The money is tempting but not worth the drama and not worth working your butt off with 3 other people. They expect you to get done with more than 8 hours of work in only 8 hours. No overtime is paid. Good luck if you decide on working with them. ,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Gibsonia, PA",9/2/22,2022,9,2
"Overworked, but I don't blame them.","The best way I can sum up my 90 day experience at Walmart in one word is ""unenjoyable."" There were good moments at my job, don't get me wrong, but it was mostly nonstop objective after objective with almost no breathing room in between. However, I was hired during the peak of the COVID outbreak, which put me in an unfortunate position. I was expected to have a pick rate of over 100 items/minute, and my manager emphasized how they were ""very competitive with their numbers.""Despite this, I still wish I felt I was more valued at my job. It would be even better if the managers treated my coworkers and I nicer though.Needless to say I worked there once and I'm never going back.",1,Former Employee,Express Shopper ,"Tucson, AZ",9/2/22,2022,9,2
Toxic,"Management genuinely does not care about associates. Any push for performance is because salaried management gets a bonus. Associates no longer receive a quarterly bonus(quarterly $100+ based on attendance/longevity/sales) , they get Walmart+ (Yearly $99 value). Hard workers get pushed out because they can never do enough but slackers always seem to be praised. ",1,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"Meridian, ID",9/2/22,2022,9,2
Bad management,The management is what makes the place horrible. They pick and choose who they are going to be strict on while their favorites get away with anything. The management treats like you are a machine and expect you to hit times that are unrealistic. When you try to report the management harassment they are protected by the higher ups and you are ignored. Besides management Walmart would be a good job. You could listen to music and get about an hour and a half for break. ,2,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Miami, FL",9/2/22,2022,9,2

Different Ball Game,"My supervisor was a sweetheart.A typical day in Walmart went like this i was left to attend 2 sections while loading a cart and offloading, attending to customers' needs, clearing, cleaning aisles.

Disorganized chaos,The facility is run poorly and the team leads never do anything to help. They complain we don’t get stuff out fast enough but we are never brought all the items we need and it runs up our times. The setup of the online dispense department is terrible also and we all get in each other’s ways which slows our times down even more and we get in trouble. The whole setup is poorly run and honestly nobody seems to even care. I see why the job has such a high turnover rate. Honestly I will never work for Walmart again. I guess I should have known better. ,1,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Cicero, NY",9/2/22,2022,9,2

Great Entry Level ,"Walmart is a great entry level job with good pay for the work asked. Also they are great with breaks and lunches giving more than most other jobs.  The downside is that the opportunities for advancement are fewer than advertised. Also if you are promoted to an hourly supervisor (team lead) the work life balance drops drastically.

Pay was amazing. Job was ridiculous.,Not all the management was bad. There were a handful of great managers. Some made us do jobs that made no sense and had no productivity at the end of the day it seemed to just make us look busy without actually accomplishing anything. They didn't really care about our imput on anything even when some employees had very valid things to say followed by good reasoning. Overall some of the things we did made very little sense. There was poor communication between the 3 shifts. They seemed to always be rivaling which seemed petty and childish. Sometimes their expectations were way above and beyond the reality of what our crew could actually accomplish in a realistic setting. They had very little understanding for the fact we had to stop and assist customers and some of the managers would get very angry that we were accomplishing enough and blame it on laziness rather than looking at any other factors. They used anger and annoyance to enforce us to get the jobs done instead of encouragement (most managers) there were a few managers that really did keep me holding on to the job and make me enjoy it. They made it clear that they weren't better than us because they were higher up like some of the others acted like. At the end of my experience there I did get let go due to being over in points do to health issues which I hold no grudge against because it was out of the power of the managers that had to let me go. One of them tried everything in his power to get me to stay.

"Hard to feel wanted or noticed, hard to grow farther in the company",It's a good enough place to work as long as you don't have goals in life. Moving up is hard to do even if you are qualified for the position. Work life balance doesn't really happen here,1,Current Employee,Shop Manager/Technician ,"Delta, CO",8/31/22,2022,8,31
A place to work till you die,Honestly Walmart is not the worst place to work but the environment there makes the days longer and miserable. The longer you're there the more depressed you get. In rural areas they are one of the better paying companies but it comes with the feeling of being replaceable and undesired. Most of the time you go to work you're sad over worked and underappricated. ,1,Former Employee,OGP Team Lead ,"Delta, CO",8/31/22,2022,8,31

It is about what you would expect,"Most of my day is spent in the backroom unloading the truck. Occasionally, stocking grocery or pulling fret to the floor is required. I have learned better communication skills, but only so that customers are less likely to yell at me. Management changes there mind about rules constantly, and they all have favorites. The co-workers are great people, but some are lazy.  ",3,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,"Hiram, GA",8/31/22,2022,8,31
Stressful management,I loved working here. Pay is quite nice for an overnight stocking position. The only downside i would have to have with this job is management. 90% of managers or team leads are more focused on there career then geniunely being a good person. Managers stand around all night on there phones and yell because your not working fast enough. Otherwise if your good at putting your head down and focusing on your job its a pretty good place,3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Vidor, TX",8/31/22,2022,8,31
Best,Cashier pay is decent. The facility is clean. Management was okay. I have nothing to complain about. They have the new kiosk cashier machine which I think is interesting.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Mansfield, TX",8/31/22,2022,8,31

good for a stepping stone not for long term,the job itself is very easy to learn and do but its the behind the scenes poor work culture that will have you not want to stick around. good for a summer job or if you just got laid off and need a job quick but not worth staying for the long haul.,3,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Griffin, GA",8/31/22,2022,8,31
A reliable and stable job with usual downsides.,"Working primarily in the distribution centers. It's good honest work that can keep you busy throughout the day. Most of what you do is either solo or with small (2-3 person) teams. Overtime really depends on facility needs. For a stretch of nearly a year my department had mandatory overtime every week due to covid. After though we had days where people could (voluntarily) be sent home or have short days. People are a mixed bag. Some are great, others make the job harder.Pros:Very good job security. No issues wondering if the place will shut down or lack of orders will eat into your pay check unless you choose. Essential workers so pandemic proof. Plenty of opportunities to go to multiple different departments. Advancement to manager positions internally possible. Pays well.Cons:Managers. They do allow anyone to try, and that often results in favoritism, poor work ethic from staff, extra work put on those who don't slack off to make up for the ones that do, problems not being addressed, rules not being enforced, safety compromised to meet production goals. I could go on. The few times someone speaks up, then it swings hard the other way with micromanagement, timing breaks (though that's sometimes justified with some people taking 50 min breaks when it's supposed to be 20 min), petty behavior. Then the spotlight moves on to someone else and the problems return, usually with the person who spoke up being targeted in some manner. Majority shouldn't be managers and realistically, areas would be better off without. Very unfortunate.Communication is also pretty bad.

Very stressful for the good worker.,"Management has a tendency to take advantage of people who do more then the required work per person, thus making it hard to like the job.

Poorly Run,"I worked as a personal shopper when this department just came out. It was extremely hectic and poorly run. Most of the time I was doing 2 people's jobs and there were definitely times when I was doing close to 5. We are expected to have at least 4-5 people in the back helping us. There were several times when it was just me by myself or only 1 other person. Our marketing manager would constantly deprive us to see how much we could do with the least amount of resources. We had a phone that we had to answer when customers were waiting too long on their orders. This would ring constantly if there was only 1 person in the back. This is because that person can not physically sort every order, then locate the items for every order in the freezer, cooler, and ambient locations and finally dispense those orders while answering the phone. Not every department was like this, and I feel like maybe my store's location was an anomaly, but be prepared to leave this place whenever it gets like this if you are offered a job there. I worked there for 9 months. I never called off, or showed up late. Was never offered a promotion.",2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Bryan, OH",8/30/22,2022,8,30

Good job but has some supervisors without leadership skills,"My overall experience at Walmart was good. I had coworkers that I enjoyed working with and liked my job as a Fresh Associate in Produce.

A rocky workplace,"I don't usually write reviews, but for this specific Walmart Supercenter, I have to. Throughout this entire store (#3402) there is favoritism and unfairness. There is no one to turn to when you've had enough of the unfairness because everyone who treats you unfairly goes hand in hand with the only superior you can tell. The breaks are always late and you have to constantly remind them about your Lunch break. The team leads do nothing but stand around and laugh with each other instead of doing their jobs and will write you up over a problem even if you are in the right just because they want to. They do not care about health situations like back pain or fibromyalgia. I do not recommend working at this tore honestly, but if you have good patience give it a go I guess.",3,Current Employee,Apparel Team Associate ,"Stockbridge, GA",8/30/22,2022,8,30

It’s not like I’m not able to work more they just won’t give me more hours and expect me to get everything done in three hours. They don’t excuse hospital visits as a reason to miss work even with a doctors note.  They point you for the minimalist of things. Some are understandable like not showing up and not calling in, but being pointed because you came in when you weren’t scheduled and started working your normal hours on a day you put in your availability is a low blow.

Good ,Working at Walmart is good people whom you work with nice manager’s are good friendly and helpful I worked at Walmart for about two years I was so happy to work I thought this is going to be my last and final job in my life but my mother got sick and she was old so I decided go back to my country and take care her so I lived there for a while and she passed so I come back so before I look somewhere else I apply to rehire I don’t know i will be given chance again to work for Walmart thanks ,5,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Reno, NV89506",8/29/22,2022,8,29
Good pay,"There is a need for seasoned ,older and mature management. Being an overnight stocker is very stressful. We only have a few to work the store. They keep pushing us to the limits. Too much workload that has to be done in a few hours. Coworkers are getting stressed out due to too much workload and  poor management. Nobody seems to care about the morale or a person's health. I feel we are getting punished for the backlog of  inventory in the backroom.  Many stores are suffering from this.    I have been employed there for years. This job should be enjoyable but it's not.

Job is easy but customers… ,"I enjoyed my job overall at Walmart. Was easy for me to learn and pick up. Honestly it truly depends on the location. Overall I did not like the customers that came in. Rudest people I’ve ever encountered in my retail career were at Walmart. The company has too many changes at times. In the short year and 4 months I was there I had two store managers come through. Also I they changed the coaches around a lot too. I myself started as stock 2 Coach, then moved to GM Coach, and went then to Frontend Coach. More than half of the other coaches Ended up being moved to other stores. This made it difficult to be successful at times because everyone was always new to their role.

The culture in the store was good, learned different phrases to assist customers. The hardest part of the job was, assisting the Loss Prevention area by reviewing surveillance of customers.

I did not always enjoy coming to work here but some days were better than others. When I first started I was getting paid $11 and now it’s gone up to $15 which is nice.

Stressful job with almost no means to advance ,"While the health benefits and dentist benefits are good, management does not help out its workers at all. I worked in three different locations at Walmart for a total of 18 years, and I interviewed nine times for various positions. Despite being a loyal worker and always going above and beyond, I was never advanced. Management is good on telling you what to do but when you are in the weeds they will not provide you assistance of any kind. Many times I was pressured unfairly to stay late on multiple occasions, I would come in on my day off just to help out the team, with no real recognition other than a verbal “thank you“. As for the hard-working ones, I found that if you took it slow for one day they will be all over your case where is the not so productive ones would not have anything said to them at all. I would absolutely not recommend this place to anyone. There are far better companies out there that will treat you as a person, rather than a number.

They are there to make money for the store and nothing more. They don't care how much you have to stress out or kill yourself to meet their goals. The assistants make things happen. These folks are the bread and butter of Walmart. They point everyone in the right direction, and despite higher management, they get it done. They are all over worked and underpaid no matter how you look at it. Unfortunately they live, eat and breath Walmart. The bathrooms are always nasty, but the clientel don't help the matter at all.

"Fast paced work, useful and transparent monitoring/posting of real-time performance statistics.","As an OPD shopper I found their system of correct product/customer order location/identification a helpful indicator of my own learning curve. You must be able to quickly and correctly fill up to 8 orders during each ""walk"" and can immediately compare your performance throughout your shift to that of other newbies as well as seasoned ""pickers."" This can be heartening or disheartening. Unloading the baskets onto pallets or into freezers/refrigerators very demanding: think fast paced lifting of up to 40 pounds sometimes above your head into tightly packed spaces while trying to stay out of the way of others doing the same. Cashiering is a drop of two dollars in pay:  less vertical lifting demands, but repetitive side to side lifting and hand dexterity and coordination, while watching screen and chatting to lines of cranky customers waiting with overflowing carts and crying children.This can make the day pass quickly. If you are young with no problems standing on thin mats/cement floors for 40 hours a week and do more than just sleep on your days off, this job is for you.Walmart is secure employment at competitive wages. There are amazing educational opportunities and lots of potential for moving up the ladder into higher positions, lateral transfers.

Bad at management and scheduling.,"When I first started, they didn't have anyone set up to help me train. I was just blindly working with no one to help me.

I also tried to change my schedule as I am a college student and they told me they 'don't think changing my hours would be a good idea'. I had high hopes for this job but management failed me.

Undervalued work for only slightly better than minimum wage,"Everything I discuss here is obviously only applicable to the location and the time I was present, so things may have changed since then. I highly doubt it, however, as a friend of mine had to work under the same if not worse conditions as recent as this year (2022). During their time, they also received a physical injury with medical evidence to support the connection between it and their job, yet no compensation from the company. They had to quit for the sake of their health, and were stuck with a hefty bill to pay as a result. The only slightly above average wage that is given by this company was certainly not going to help support the bill, either.As for my experience, while it started relatively positive, it quickly plateaued into a mentally and physically taxing routine. I joined this job during high school, as it's the only place offering a wage that's higher than minimum in my region, but was forced to work 40+ hour work weeks, despite supposedly having paperwork and regulations against that for minors (I still wonder how they covered that all up). They would rarely alter any hours for me to work on my homework, or have time to breathe, even when asked weeks in advance, because they put all of their faith on me and one other person to carry a whole department every evening, rather than give that role to the -then- only adults, ones with a ""manager"" title.I somehow managed to survive to graduation alive, despite many concerns from my teachers throughout the year, and even continued working during college.

Overnight is awful,"Walmart emphasizes on team work but overnight has no sense of team work and often ""helping"" means doing it all by yourself because that person didn't want to do whatever you were ""helping"" them with. Workers are not fully trained and taught everything they should know. Work by team leads often gets thrown down to their ""team"" because they don't want to do it. People are not managed correctly based on time and ability. Higher ups are often lied to about what has been completed and what hasn't. Doing more than what is required will be expected if you do it once, and working good will only cause them to take advantage of you and expect more and more. Asking for help is difficult since no one gets told or taught anything. The better your quality of work, the less likely you are to get days off approved. .The associates themselves are honestly very cool people. Few of them work good, but they're not bad people.

Not just one person but all and they say its a promotional pay wage and not guranteed. Not only does management treat people poorly it is worse if you're gay or are looked at to be weaker. HR does ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING no matter who goes in there or how many time the same problem is brought to their attention still nothing gets done or changed. They dont even follow their own safety rules. Including stretching before every shift this is done for at most a few seconds if at all. Even HR complains about it and still nothing changes.

"Cool people, unrealistic expectations ","The pay was okay, the bonuses were nice, the personal time was nice, the only thing I had a problem with was upper management being lazy and not doing anything other than pointing their finger at things that didn't have time to get done. I'm not a lollygagger by any means, as a matter of fact I rush and hurry and stress myself about getting things accomplished almost to a fault. If it's too much for me to get done then it's too much to get done. And I'm fine with that as long as it's understood that things aren't done because of someone being lazy or inefficient or unproductive. When you bust your hump and stress yourself to the max and get a 120% accomplished and work yourself to the Bone only to have some smug manager come in the next morning and make smart alec comments about this and that little nitpicky things that aren't perfect when all they ever do is sit in the office and play no part in the teamwork, that's where I have a problem. So it's a great job if you're able to let that kind of thing roll off your back, but it put me right out the door",3,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"MacArthur, WV",8/24/22,2022,8,24

Benefits are decent Management is horrible,"I worked for Walmart for 24 years, and finally left after consistently  being denied PTO, particularly a weekend off. The store manager was on vacation more than he was at the store, but I got asked why I wanted 10 days off for a family vacation and asked where I was going and what I was doing. In recent years, they have taken away holiday pay and profit sharing bonuses, unless you're a team lead. The holiday pay is now put into PTO and supposedly you can take PTO to get paid for a holiday, but I was denied when I asked for it. It was a decent company to work for many years ago, but now it's profits before people. ",2,Former Employee,Bakery Clerk ,"McPherson, KS",8/23/22,2022,8,23

"Great pay, but every great thing about working here has its own downside.","To start off, really anybody physically can work here, no matter how terribly out of shape you think you are, or how old and beaten up you actually are! With that out of the way, the job really isn't that skilled and only takes a month or so to get used to (Mentally and Physically). However, for every great experience or cool thing about the job Walmart tells you about, there is a massive downside to it all. For example, you only have to work 3-4 days a week! Usually for 8 hours or less. This small amount of your week is not to be underestimated though, because on off days, it is a struggle to do any physical activities. You can only attempt to recover. Another example is how everybody (including coworkers) want you to do better and challenge/help you to do so. The problem with this is that it is extremely overwhelming to constantly be under stress. Why are order fillers paid so much? Because from the moment you get up on a work day, you are expected to be closing in on perfection. If you can handle enough stress to kill an elephant, than congratulations, this may be your job! As a last example, there is a percentage that you are needing to keep to. There are many ways in which you can fail to meet this and still keep your job, but there are also ways in which this system is not good (for me). It is challenging to keep to this, and even though most including myself keep above it, it also causes you to feel and act horribly when you are not up to the goal. I underestimated how a silly number screwed with my psych so much. Managers and coworkers will never appreciate your good - more...",3,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Mankato, MN",8/23/22,2022,8,23

Excited to try something new! ,"Worked 14yrs and made my way up the ladder. Then they wouldn't promote me. Peers were able to sit in office on phones all day. Associates were frustrated. I was popular and well liked and easily the favorite because I was out engaging with the teams.

reasonable workplace no communication,It really depends on the market you're in if you're going to like your job or not. The management isn't really on the same page at most stores.

Management Sucks,"Management is terrible. Most on third shift are lazy, and don't do much. The lazy people will get away with being lazy. If you work hard, management will more than likely make you do extra work to pick up others slack, rather than do something about the lazy people.

Easy Work Made Hard,"Pretty bad management honestly, they always implemented or changed things that made our relatively easy job harder, like a mad doctor removing the perfectly functioning legs off someone and giving them 2 peg legs and expecting them to walk faster. We were also heavily understaffed most days, then occasionally we would be over staffed for a day or two and we would have too many people so management would have to throw us into other departments. Honestly it was incredibly miserable but easy work and fantastic pay for what the job was.",3,Former Employee,OGP Associate ,"Leavenworth, KS",8/22/22,2022,8,22
Pay is good.  Work life balance is not. ,"Depending on your position and the store you are in, work life balance can be a struggle.

It’s okay ,"Walmart isn’t bad. However they do have you work more than what you are paid. Management for me wasn’t always around, but I did have one manager who was always teaching me something new almost every time I worked. He was very elaborate and so very patient and knowledgeable. I would have liked to stay, but it wasn’t the best environment to work in. It was extremely stressful. I started around Christmas time and I was by myself. There are supposed to be 2 in the garden area, but there never was. Not until I left. Overall, it’s okay. Not a terrible place to work, but a good job if you need one.

It's a pretty good place to work.,"It's a very labor intensive job with accommodations for those who can't lift much (processing shoes, clothing and sorting small freight).

Ok-ish/ mediocre place to work,"The pay is decent for a younger, new to the workforce kind of person. Management can be very hit or miss. Some people in management can be very rude and distasteful. Others are very pleasing to be around. The workload is also very hit or miss. Some days it’s easy to get tasks done others you are overloaded and understaffed and still expected to get that same amount of work done. The store itself is buried in freight with no where to put anything. Each department is different and some can be very absorbed in drama with too much at home things being brought into the work life. Walmart is not understanding about time off around holidays which is understandable but specifically on every weekend day, they don’t often give time off for weekends even if you request for time off months in advance, they are slow to respond and you often have to seek out management multiple times just to have your request heard. They are not very flexible with days off and hours as they require new associates to work at least one weekend day. It is easy to get burnt out quickly at this job.

Rat race with communication issues and lack of standards,"During my time working at Walmart, there has been a consistent lack of communication and not wanting to put direction in writing to ensure all know to what they will be held accountable.

Productivity over Customer Service ,I started  with company back in the 90's. The company was more into helping customers and giving them the one stop shopping experience  with  quality service.  You could always fi D a smiling face to help find merchandise back then. Since then the company  got bigger friendly smiles became less present and more profit more important to shareholders. It not the same now as it was then. Everyone wanted to be there to work.  Now all about  the product to shelf than the person buying or getting it to shelf.  The benefits and pay are still  great.

It was a thrill to keep trying to outdo myself! The good that comes to mind, is meeting new people, and being appreciated by my regular customers. Customers will seek me out to ring them up.

Just a job until you find something better. ,"All I can speak for is my experience at the Franklin store. Very much play favoritism. Management is a joke. Maybe a handful actually deserve the title they have. Promotions are based on how well your liked. Not how you perform your job. Coaches don't coach who actually NEEDS coaching but rather overwork and set impossible standards for those who do take initiative and actually do their job. Be prepared to get singled out in meetings solely because you choose to keep to yourself at work. Seeing as you are BUSY because you one of the few they have there that actually work and not come just to socialize and do NOTHING. However these people are accommodated because their someone's buddy while the workers are given a raw deal until their finally just fed up. Its true one is going to have some type of issues at any job, but go somewhere and use that energy where hard actually pays off. You can't get anywhere with a company that stays worried about the wrong things and don't even make the effort to get to know their employees personally. This would in fact make diversity easier in the workplace considering that everyone isn't the same. Very toxic work environment. Basically smooch or get seen out the door by them pulling underhanded tricks after the other until your gone. Don't  be a quiet ""robot"" that works yourself in the ground.

I then trained in multiple areas, learning to work the whole front end.  I frequently work full shifts in customer service and/or money center.  I then found out from those employees that we don't get a raise even after being in those areas for years.  The constant smiling and being helpful to oftentimes rude and unhygienic people is tough to maintain.

Only for the most desperate job seekers ,"Find ANYTHING other than Walmart. I could go on and on about how awful it is. Managers are horrible, you hardly receive help even if it’s a priority. Customers are absolutely awful because most think Walmart is the everything store, it’s not. You can expect a daily dose of lashings from both customers and managers. The managers are total hypocrites in that you’re expected to meet certain amounts of product be stocked, yet if you’re buried in customers and ultimately CANT get around to it, you’ll still hear about it. Doing good work simply places MORE work on you. Lastly, it pays like garbage. Only, and I mean ONLY, apply at Walmart if there’s nothing left for you.

Almost impossible to get time off. Dumb 5 point system, you can only get 4.5 points, at 5 your fired. They dont care about you. Decent pay, but in my opinion not worth the toll it takes on your life outside of work. Had a manager who would threaten to write you up if you didnt do overtime, also lied about how the point system works to not let people call out.

Their employees have a brain, so speak to them in ""adult talk.""4) Prices need to be clearly marked on shelves & merchandise in their proper places.

Terrible place to work.,Exactly like high-school. Promotions are based on who likes you. You can be the hardest worker in your area and all that will happen is they will expect more. Forced into working roles I did  not sign up for when accepting the job position.Extremely toxic working environment.,1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Mebane, NC",8/17/22,2022,8,17
Severely understaffed and constantly overworked,"Everyday working at Walmart it was always understaffed, place lacked teamwork and overall willingness to help you in a time of need. I was constantly overworked and always was exhausted due to the fact I was the one having to make up the difference (there were still good people all be it very few who actually wanted to help). On top of that Walmart kept deciding to up orders significantly knowing the fact that we don't have the workforce possible to handle the increased workload.",2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Aurora, IL",8/17/22,2022,8,17
walmart is ok,"lots of walking around the entire store and its very busy. sometimes you have to work outside in the hot weather, and in the snow. always being rushed. attendance/point system is terrible. they expect you to do the most. management is terrible, they don't care about you.",3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Frederick, MD",8/17/22,2022,8,17
The benefits are good. Coworkers are helpful. Staying busy and customer service,You have morning and evening meetings to know where help is most needed. Freight is all important to get out on floor to stock. Management is slow to answer customers complaints when they arise. Overall a decent place to work,3,Former Employee,Customer Service/Stocker/Cashier ,"Columbus, GA",8/17/22,2022,8,17
It's so different from when I started,"Working for a company for six years means facing a lot of changes. While it's understandable that a business has to evolve and adapt to survive, I don't agree with decisions made on a corporate level and my personal store did not take the proper steps to work with their employees or consider their opinions.",3,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"Chickasha, OK",8/17/22,2022,8,17
Easy work for decent pay if you get your hours in. ,Enjoyed my job and the pay was decent for the work we did. But management overlooks the people who actually work hard and will stand around and let one person do all the work without saying anything about it. ,1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Lafayette, IN",8/17/22,2022,8,17
Management can be harsh on Associates,"You will work hard for your money.  Benefits are good, but could be explained better.  If you come to work, do your job and don't call off, you can do well.  Promotions are very likely for those who want to work.  Management at times, puts their stress down on the Associates.  Just do as they ask and get through the day.",4,Current Employee,Stocker ,Ohio,8/17/22,2022,8,17
Strict and rude managers ,Walmart has been the strictest place I have ever worked. They aren’t super lenient when it comes to personal things. Walmart is also the rudest place I have ever worked. Managers are mean as snakes and genuinely could not care less about you. ,2,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Oakwood, GA",8/17/22,2022,8,17
It's ok. ,"The company cares very little for the individual.

"Very stressful, own your own. Poor learning opportunities. Poor opportunity of growth. Lots of retaliation. ","Absolutely limited chances of growth unless management loves you. Tons, & tons of favoritism. You get thrown to the wolves, basically. Fast pace environment, rules change daily. Nobody goes by the policy. They love to retaliate against you. & make your job absolutely horrible when they get mad/upset with you. They will threaten to fire you over everything. They absolutely refuse to take dr notes. The company that does the LOA’s is denying everything, even Covid leaves. They refuse to work with you on bereavement, or your children. When you work for Walmart you might as well give up any kind of life that you get outside of the building, because they want you to do anything, & everything for them, & they want you to forget about your family outside of work, so you can focus on them wholeheartedly. They don’t care about you as a person, & they don’t care about the problems you have going on in your life. If you don’t have a babysitter, or you have a sick child, & have to take them to the Dr, you might as well be ready to get fussed at.

Great Management,"I always feel my team lead has my back and is open to hear the good, the bad and the ugly of what's going on.  All in all, I'm very satisfied working here.

Do not work here if you value your personal life. ,"Unless you kiss a**, you will not go anywhere here. They value political beliefs over work ethic. You cannot get promoted based on work. I saw very productively low workers get promoted over people who met their goals. They got it because of political beliefs and friendship. Not work. They expect too much work for what they pay. It is completely unreasonable and it shows why they cannot keep people. They go through a lot of workers. Don't work here ",1,Former Employee,Order Filler ,"Moberly, MO",8/17/22,2022,8,17
"High paced, easy work. Generally poor management",It was a High paved and focused job but if you could deal with the poor management and as part of a team you were pretty much fine.

Lots of confusion ,Everyone in management gave different answers. The system used when employees need to be out is taxing especially if you are sick. Accomodations for limits needed per Dr. order is not taken seriously. Also you can be a hard worker but they will take advantage. Unless you are part of a favored group.,1,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Ladson, SC",8/17/22,2022,8,17

"Fun, Opportunities for growth",All in all working at Walmart was fun. Plenty of opportunities for growth. My only problem here was some of the managers are  very unprofessional and only became managers because of the connections they have. Some managers have family in higher positions within the company pulling strings for them,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Dallas, TX",8/17/22,2022,8,17
Yikes ,Too much to even say. Great job but toxic af. The coaches need an enema. Sorry but they truly do. They are too comfortable and manipulative. If you’re not in their click then you’re just a bad employee. They will honestly throw you to the sharks. There’s one or two good ones tho. The battle with associates will never end but when management can’t work together and as a team then it will continue to be chaos. The actual working part really isn’t that bad and can be fun especially if you like working with all kinds of people that are genuinely part of the team. Same team…a hopeful goal.,3,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Buffalo, MN",8/17/22,2022,8,17

Horrible place to work,They overwork you. They expect one person to do all the work! When they know they need help in a department they don’t care.

Nightmare of Cut Corners and Negligent Management,"The constant lack of working/available equipment leads to a very stressful and unproductive work environment. It's only made worse by the abysmal number of working associates and utter absence of competent management. Due to the corners being cut left and right, our department is always behind schedule leading to long lines of angry customers who are always eager to take their frustrations out on your fellow coworkers. What has management done to rectify this issue you may ask? Nothing at all but bicker amongst themselves, assuming they even show up to work to begin with. Those associates fortunate enough to make friends with the upper management, also seem to never show up to work but are never punished for it.Turnover is high, so expect your entire department to refresh every 2 months or so leading to high numbers of new hires. This of course, also leads to the efficiency of the entire department dipping and more stress for everyone involved when rush hour arrives.Honestly the hardest part of the job is staying the full 9 hours without any/late breaks, the constant verbal abuse from ungrateful customers, verbal abuse from unprofessional team leads, the stress of tight time margins for orders, and management seemingly doing everything in its power to ensure you can't finish the job you're paid to do.The most enjoyable part? LEAVING.",2,Current Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Huntsville, TX",8/16/22,2022,8,16

It’s what you make it.,"The work load that’s expected is awful. If you can get past what you do in the day never being enough than you’ll be just fine. Every store is different management wise. Some leaders are great and others not so much. When one team is suffering or behind everyone in the store hurts. Attendance is 5 points max. Late .5. Call out 1 point. You accrue pto and ppto. Health insurance is okay, varies based off store locations. ",3,Current Employee,Team Lead ,Alabama,8/16/22,2022,8,16
Work in Maintenance: you are treated like garbage ,"Not been at this job a whole year yet and I promise this is the worse job I have ever worked in my life.

My time at walmart,"this is my time at walmart in a nutshell.an issue comes up the very week you start, you go to the office and talk to the managers, the managers do nothing to solve the issue, you are forced to work in close proximity to those who caused the issue and all the begging in the world will not  change the situation, all the while you worry about it happening again.",1,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Jackson, MO",8/16/22,2022,8,16

Highly not recommended ,"Working as a cashier for Walmart is a big cup of stress. Customers constantly tried to steal items (whether big or small) and use coupons that where either expired or not for the correct item. You had to always be available on the holidays and not all the time would you get breaks. The store was constantly hot (being located in Texas I can understand), but they did nothing for the temperature. A customer passed out once and even I experienced having a seizure from being dehydrated. The only thing they did for the customer was ask if they were okay, and I got a call from HR making sure I wouldn't sue. The pay was not enough and the customers were ridiculous. Management never really cared about you except them having a job. Also a little word of advice, if you are leaving for another job and you put in your 2 week notice, don't offer to work on your last day. They will immediately take you off the schedule and claim to ""FIRE YOU"". ",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rockdale, TX",8/16/22,2022,8,16
Management sucks ,"Management sucks, there is no communication whatsoever. You have to deal with the worst customers everyday and management will always take their side.

Management does not care about employees or customers.  ,Walmart doesn't care about anyone just make sure the sale goes through.  They don't accommodate for disabilities in the workplace.

horrible,"working at Walmart is an experience. As long as your doing your job and taking your breaks on time  you'll be fine. The worst part about Walmart are the managers, there is so much favoritism that its suffocating. i have been in two different departments and each one had managers favoriting certain coworkers. Managers walk around the store acting like their the 'stuff' and they do absolutely nothing they claim that its their job to walk around and ""manage"" but when i need them for something they are no where to be found. OH and if you want to take a vacation and DON'T want to use PPTO Walmart system will take your PPTO hours anyway and the excuse is ""oh it does that sometimes"" and you cant get those hours back once you used it. The way Walmart works is "" every 40 hours you work you get 1 hour of PPTO"" its taken me months just to get 5 hours of PPTO.

If you have to threaten or swear at people to get them to do their job, you are not a leader. For the most part Walmart does not hire leaders, they higher BOSSES. Now in defense of some of the managers, they are getting pressure from the store manager who is getting pressure from the market manager. And again, Walmart does not tend to hire leaders at any level. Often, they just hire someone to fill a slot. There is also a lot of instances where they just promote their friends, instead of who would be best for the position.

If you have a good work ethic an work hard they never leave you alone an always make you work but if you are lazy and don’t do anything this is a perfect job for you because hardly anybody does anything all day and gets told nothing while us hard workers carry all the weight of everybody on our shoulders and pick up the slack.

Horrible work roles,Walmart could care less about your personal life. If you have issues at home and have to be off they are quick to terminate for any reason. They expect you to do so much extra that's not your job description. In winter they make sales associates and auto techs go out and shovel snow and get carts. If it's slow you have to go unload the truck by hand. Or get sent to grocery to stock candy. Anything but your job,1,Former Employee,Automotive Service Technician ,"Lake Geneva, WI",8/15/22,2022,8,15

It'll work if it's the only thing available.,"I'm sure this varies store-by-store, but many employees referred to the store as ""Hellmart"" and many of my coworkers were constantly stressed and overworked. People were constantly drawn from other departments to help ours. People who mistreated other employees get promoted to manager.I was injured during my time there, and was sent to a specific urgent care without any other options. Despite being injured on the job, Wal-Mart decided that they would not pay for my medical bill even though they sent me to their urgent care. I would never recommend this location to anyone, and would never recommend this company to anyone worried about being injured.",1,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"King, NC",8/15/22,2022,8,15
Set hours and days off,"The best thing about working for Walmart is set working hours and set days off. Most of my coworkers are fairly decent. As a frontend associate (cashier) I see a lot of favoritism as in some associates have to do certain tasks or work in certain areas and others can say NO they do not want to work a certain area or do a particular task and the front end team leads don't bat an eye and let them do whatever they want.  I do not see the front end Coach that often pretty sure she sits in her office most of the day and delegates literally absolutely everything to her front end team leads to take care of. If you need to talk to the frontend Coach about anything they are not there or unavailable. If you want to move into a different position within the store and your a cashier or front end associate good luck with that as once your up there your stuck there as the front end is always short staffed and has high turnover and you will be completely overlooked to take another position. The frontend Coach says ""You will need to wait for a replacement"" before you switch positions which never ever happens. The whole situation I just described with wanting to switch positions either for more money or so you can grow and learn something new is horrendous. Burn out happens and it's time to look elsewhere for employment. ",3,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Vancouver, WA",8/15/22,2022,8,15
I loved it. ,"I loved working at Walmart, however the management was horrible at Fenton Walmart, I had to miss days of work because I was in summer school and had cheerleading practice while heading into my senior year of high-school and they wouldn’t work around my schedule causing me to be let go because of how many points I had received because I was at school. ",2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Fenton, MI",8/15/22,2022,8,15
The paid is not worthy the stress,Is the most toxic environment I have ever work. The more you go up the ladder of management the better the paid and the worst stress level you get. If you plan to stay in a lower position woth the more time you are in the company more they expect from you and more they would demand for the same pay rate. You can't trust no one because in the moment they found themselves in trouble they would put the blame on you. If you're the Overnight Team Lead or Coach be prepared that they would expect that you do all the work related to stocking and store standards when the team and tools are not enough. ,2,Former Employee,Overnight Manager ,"Cheektowaga, NY",8/15/22,2022,8,15

Hourly to Salary is a HUGE pay bump.,Each store is independent from each other. Your store may be great while another one is a dumpster fire. It depends on your management team.

Pros and cons of working at Walmart ,Fun when you get to know people and have friends but if you get caught talking to them outside of your breaks you’ll get coached/wrote up. Management is terrible and treats you like you’re less than human bc you’re just a normal worker. My store manager at Walmart 151 fired me for being sick and when I went to see if there was anything else I could do she said “you can try all you want I’m not giving your job back”.

Walmart is sad unrealistic not a good job period,Horrible ethics poor treatment of employees period. I had covid they let me go due to that. Absent in pandemic!!! Pathetic scheduling and never 40 hours ,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,United States,8/14/22,2022,8,14
"Great gig for high school/college students, Flexible scheduling","One of the best teen/highschool jobs you can get. I started this job my junior year in highschool and I am proud of how much I have learned and money I made over the course of a year and some change. If you want to go even further you could get your college tuition covered by Walmart if you can bear through the pain of full-time. Every department in Walmart is easy work, obviously some may be harder than others however overall it is an consistently easy job. I learned how to be more social and what the real world was like. You will definitely run into rude & entitled people whether it is co-workers or customers (in some cases both). Culture was good for the most part until I went full-time. Management was terrible at there jobs, constantly quitting and HR hiring new people throughout the stores history. The only credit I can give management is they were very flexible with my schedule and excellent at accepting any time off requests I had. The hardest part of the job is the fact that the more you learn = the more you are USED! Keep your ""skills and knowledge"" to what is bare minimum and don't try to learn absolutely everything because you will get worked unbelievably hard in multiple departments doing other associates jobs and not receive credit for it just like I did. The most enjoyable part were the bonds I made with workers and some of the customers. Older associates will test you and they may disrespect you, be a jerk, etc... but you must stand up for yourself or you will never be respected by anyone including management. Also I want to mention I got 2  decent raises and - more...",2,Former Employee,Fresh Associate ,North Carolina,8/14/22,2022,8,14

Want to much for what they pay,When I first got there all was good. Later they made expectations with night stock crew. Told them they have to do a box per minute putting away stock. I get4 pallets to do in pets they tell you 3 and a half hours. Go by computer generated estimates. Which are not accurate and says this right on their computers. Also they are sexist. I see men wok hard and get fired and couched. I see women stand around on their phone walk around the store talking to each other not doing their job right on camera and nothing. They had a problem with me not keeping up with their computer estimates.  I told them to move me to maintenance.  I work in maintenance for a while. The manager loved me told me he wished he had 4 people just like me. Then they put me back on stock and I couldn't keep up with computer estimates and they fired me. Why? Why not leave me in maintenance and leave me alone to work? I remember the couch thanking me bend and knee for staying doing overtime to make sure everything was done right a few times in frozen and dairy when corporate came for inspection so he could keep his job he was worried about. Then stabs me in the back and fires me.i am going on 50 years old. Am not 25 anymore. Was hoping I had a longterm job here. They hire older people.

Definitely worth the effort ,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. The people I worked with were fun, and the benefits are honestly great for an entry level type of job. They pay above minimum wage, offer different types of paid time off (even for part time employees), a decent discount, and other employee benefits like gym membership deals and phone plans. There are days that it can be grueling, but most of the time I enjoyed the work for what it was and felt like the type of work I was doing was worth the benefits and pay rate by comparison.

N/a,Working at Walmart on its worst days can feel very much like a daily grind of customer issues and lack of support from team members.  It’s not always like this really depends on location and how staffed you are. My store manager at last store was probably best store manager I’ve ever had but even the best store managers can only do so much to make stores not feel like you’re always being told to do more and more until you’ve exhausted yourself.,3,Former Employee,Front End Coach ,"Fort Worth, TX",8/13/22,2022,8,13
Wal-Mart is not as bad as everyone makes them out to be...,I stayed at Wal-Mart much longer than I had planned.  I enjoyed my co-workers and Assistant Managers.  They were not forgiving at all when it came to taking time off or needing time off.  I ultimately left after a surgery and needed more flexibility in accommodations and scheduling than they were willing to provide.  This was well over a decade ago so hopefully they have improved in this area.,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Melbourne, FL",8/13/22,2022,8,13

Woke Walmart is going to be the end of it,"Walmart pay's differently depending on what job you are hired for. Cashiers are paid one amount, people on the floor make a little more, people picking make $2 more, people unloading trucks make $4 more. But you have to know and do all those jobs and most times it is everyday for a lower wage. Why can't we all be paid the same. Walmart policy encourage the kindergarten mentality of tattle tailing on every little thing. Makes for a poor work environment. You earn your PTO as you work and they have what is called protected time off they can't deny your time off. They also have a point system once you hit 5 you are fired but my store they would keep erasing points so you could not be fired so what is the use of having it. you have a 1 hour lunch and 2 fifteen minute brake.

"Needs better management, Get the air fixed","I was so excited to work for Walmart. I always heard that Walmart was a great place to work. Well what I heard was wrong. Maby it was the Walmart that I was at, but it was awful.  Some managers disappeare when they are suppose to be up front for help. There were several days where we had no manager at all. There needs to be a different way for people to get trained because now you are on your own. There needs to be a person that sanitizes the cash registers. They are gross. The air was not working, therefore it was hot inside the store and it was just remodeled. I had to bring a small fan to work with me so I didn't sweat so badly.  Some of the managers and lost prevention people think they are better than you and as fas as I am concerned; You work at the same place as me!!!! What makes you any better than I??",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Miamisburg, OH",8/13/22,2022,8,13

Job to have temporary ,"Cashier management not only threw me on a cash register without proper training but they are no where to be found when needing assistance or to get the designated break times they gave me. I was at a higher level position at this store before and they depend on me to keep my coworkers covered with work flow, while keeping my coworkers breaks covered and to cover their responsibilities when they are late on deadlines. It wouldn’t be such a bad job if they had trainers that knew how to train and better management. ",3,Current Employee,Cashier Associate ,"Tupelo, MS",8/13/22,2022,8,13

Great career starter ,"Walmart offers many great benefits. The school alone is worth it. As long as you stay hourly your work life balance is great. To become salary it’s more a who you know not what you know company. Once you become salary you are expected to work an insaine amount of hours, vacations will be pulled, the compensation for the level of responsibility expectations are by far un fair and under compensated. You are expected to have company email and apps on your personal phone and expected to answer and respond to email or any issue in store in your off day or when at home with your family leaving no work life balance. For a single reason individual who is a Workaholic it’s a great place to be and make a caterer but for a family orientated person I would not recommend. Every holiday is worked and weekends off or even a weekend day off is almost impossible to grab unless your in hood with the one that makes the schedules. As long as you go in with your eyes wide open and can accept the long hours it’s not a bad place to work. If your starting a family it’s amazing maternity leave is one that can not be beat fathers get 6 weeks off as well and it’s paid for 100% mothers get up to 16 weeks. If you adopt you get the same leave for bonding time. ",3,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Westminster, CO",8/13/22,2022,8,13

Most of the time coaches do not do anything about it and just tell you to ignore it. Being a online grocery shopper did have a lot of benefits were the pay was good, but if you enjoy working somewhere that has a high school mentality, then it might not be for you because there is a lot of favoritism within that workplace and a lot of gossip and just too many people worried about what other people think about you ",3,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,7901 watt ave,8/12/22,2022,8,12

It’s very to have ONE MANAGER to go to for any reason. Work is very flexible. I recommend working in pharmacy if you have good customer service and can stand all day. Negatives: High expectations. Now I work at a busy Walmart, and we have to ask customers for surveys. One bad review apparently affects your hours. Same goes with adherence (look it up). If you don’t reach the weekly cap, they will cut your hours! In short, it’s hard work, but you work with such a small team, it makes work easier.",4,Current Employee,Pharmacy Cashier ,"Anaheim, CA",8/12/22,2022,8,12

The not so wonderful world of Walmart,"Walmart started out as a great place to work, but not so much when you learn about what goes on in the background. Management is very judgmental and demands impossible exceptions when the store is short-staffed, but refuse to actually help. A couple will actually help but most just are so bothered when anyone asks for help, especially their non-favorites. Walmart has lots of favoritism and allows certain people to get away with more mostly the people who know more things in the store/more departments. Promoting is forced and they constantly try to push you in the position they want you even if you say no multiple times, and they won't listen. Most of the work is repetitive and is pointless if not impossible to accomplish due to the short-staffing. Management regularly yells at employees, rude customers, and employees in front of customers. If customers yell at employees, management doesn't seem to care because they do the same and are hypocrites. The co-workers are great and are the ones in the same boat so co-workers stick together on things. Walmart pay isn't bad but considering inflation, they need to boost it for employees especially since getting a lotto/lottery machine. I once asked for a advance on my yearly raise since they expected more responsibility without pay but was told ""we don't do that"" which was their BS excuse for not caring about employees living paycheck to paycheck. There are very few cashiers and yet 9 registers when only one is open all day for cigs and alcohol which leaves one cashier very stressed and frustrated. At least one register won't work on - more...",2,Current Employee,Customer Service Host ,"Boone, IA",8/11/22,2022,8,11

There's a very stupid points system that if you call out sick, you get a point; if you're more than 10 minutes late, half point. 5 points in 6 months and you're fired. I got 3.5 in my first two months, due to no proper training on how to use PPTO. The HR person, when I need help, will just say to go ask my team lead.

Attention can be good if you are a hard worket and a yes man there are multiple promotion paths but ive seen many people just want a job and act as such if they believe your lazy or a goof off they make your walmart life hard. So keep your head down and work medium and steady to stay the status quo or work hard and learn as much as possible and promotions are possible.

After that time I felt like I was in stalemate. They even advanced others that didn’t want to work. They advanced associates that were slow and didn’t want to work.

I'm not easily pushed to my limits, I came in everyday and did my Job to the finest perfection possible. I let a lot of stuff go in one ear and out the other because of how much drama goes on daily and you get used to it. But it got to the point where it felt personal, Like I had to stop people from pushing me around and forcing me to do the impossible and bringing up personal stuff in my life to have an advantage over me and to make me feel terrible. So i eventually quit because of harassment. I loved my co-workers with the same role as me. The management is what made it terrible and I think managers should have authority but not bring people down to make them quit.

Productive ,I am a hard worker and try to do my best but it is hard when bosses are pulling you everywhere and not letting you finish what you started. Bosses are not pulling people to the back to talk to them  they are doing it out on floor where everyone can hear. Coworkers are leaving the store like crazy. ,3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Evendale, OH",8/11/22,2022,8,11
Pay is ok. Abstract management. Little training is given but knowledge is expected.,There is structure but also every day is slightly different. The work is monotonous. Management is mysterious and inconsistent. Coworkers can be annoying or brownnosers. The hardest part is the lack of structure and planning being shared completely with associates. The most enjoyable part is opportunities to earn more.,3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Lincolnton, NC",8/11/22,2022,8,11

Do not recommend ,I absolutely do not recommend working here. Short staffed and overworked. Strict attendance policy.

More room for favorites than growing,"Wal-Mart is a good entry level job to get you off your feet. Don't expect to grow unless you kiss up to being a favorite amongst other management. If you do manage to get the promotion to Team Lead at least, it is a good pay. Unfortunately, I've seen many good people fill those shoes just to  be discouraged about the role and when they find a new job and they're happy for it, you will be put down and be labeled as an outcast no matter how long and hard you worked for the company.Normally, a day starts by looking over notes to see what you need to do. It's some easy work as long as you help the customers in time. Some customers and co-workers are nice and it's a good feeling. Most of the time this isn't the case.In all honesty and it's heart breaking to say this, but the hardest part of the job is actually working it and the enjoyable part about it is being able to clock out for the day. Most people would say 'that's just how a job is'. To me, it's more than that. When you work for a company and determine to do so, you want to leave a mark of your hard work. Unfortunately, it's hard to even put an impact and very much easier to see it go away after a day of hard work.On a positive note though, there are learning opportunities to working for Wal-Mart. You do learn about safety protocols, A.D.D. (Avoid, Deny, Defend), and plenty more. You could apply these lessons in other jobs and careers. A big thing in my opinion that I did learn from working here is that there are plenty of better options out there not just for a paycheck, but also for an enjoyable work experience.In - more...",2,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Oneida, NY",8/11/22,2022,8,11

"Job isn't a problem, but wage stagnation and poor management holds us back","Work balance is fine, you are expected to be trained for writing up customers, doing oil changes, tire work, etc. Service manager backs up techs, ACCM is hit-or-miss as they are sometimes called back to help inside the store.Which brings me to my next point, TLE is affected by the inside of the Walmart (which is totally ridiculous). We're shorthanded so we need all the overtime we can get now, but we're not allowed to anymore as overnight stocking associates used up the whole budget. Even if OT is justified, we're not allowed to just because another department used it up?Sometimes management will pull 1-2 associates to assist other departments with zoning and stocking, making us suffer. They're completely blind to how busy we can be. Speaking of management, this job is basically a dead-end if the ACCM or service manager are not leaving anytime soon. Unless you plan on transferring to another department, this job is a waste of time.Only use I can think of is if you need an entry-level position into the automotive industry.

A chaotic topsy turvy environment,"My 6 months at Walmart I worked in Online grocery and delivery. my duty was apparent, but despite this many days I would be working in a completely different department, or I would be doing another person's duties or filling in for somebody missing. My duty in OGD was simple enough I knew how to do most things after about a month of work, the goal was obvious but the management was the biggest issue in my performance and overall opinion on the workplace. It seemed like every other week there was something else given to us my the management. they would raise the number of orders that we could have in a day to a massive number, they did this a number of times and the outcome of it was always we would get behind schedule and backed up till either the department shut down for a number of days for us to catch up with every order, or the limit was lowered back down, in the time I worked there this happened around 10 times. The management would often apply ridiculous rules and specifications that decreased work performance. we were often not allowed to use most of the functions our application on our devices gave to us to make the job less complicated. the main reasoning I learned was because it hurt the companies opinion on the managers and department if we did something that was necessary in order to perform our job efficiently.all of this topped by constant staff shortages made this job often times more stressful it ever should have been.

stressful but good pay job for teen,"For a first job a Personal Shopper I personally wouldn’t recommend. It required you to walk/pace fast your whole shift and learn to deal with stress and maintaining a good attitude when costumers asked for help. You had to have patience when looking for costumers items on the sales floor, or in the back if it wasn’t on the floor stocked by the stockers which was a stress when having to be finished at a short time. Also Included heavy lifting and being in the freezer and coolers. When I first applied I applied for part-time but they ignored it and made me full time. I had to wait to be part time even though I mentioned I was a college student. They weren’t really flexible with their schedules for us college students. Also promised to give me a schedule but only gave me half of what I asked for months prior to when I needed the schedule. They made me deal with their mistakes at the end. $17 a hour was great but not so much for the pain it gave my feet after work.

Productive and Somewhat Fun Place ,"I worked at a Walmart warehouse for about 5 months back in 2021. Had the opportunity to have cool coworkers, learn how to drive 2 different kinds of forklifts, and my manager and supervisor gave me some gifts when I left to job to pursue my self-employed endeavors.

Awful,Walmart is the worst corporation ever but i guess thats what you should expect from big corporations like this now they dont care about entry level people ,1,Former Employee,Picker/Packer ,"Edgerton, KS",8/9/22,2022,8,9
Ok Workplace,It was a job. The pay was decent. The managers were a mixed bag. Some were really great and others… not so much. I learned how to work with money transactions.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Storm Lake, IA",8/9/22,2022,8,9
Walmart isn’t a fair workplace in my opinion ,"To me , Walmart is just like the Illuminati. It’s almost like you have to sell your soul to get in. The point system is unreasonable . Especially for parents. And the fact that they don’t take doctors excuses, they don’t do holiday pay but will point you double when calling out (when you only get 4) is unpredictable! You have to know someone that knows the right person to still be employed and have so many points against you. ",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Batesburg-Leesville, SC",8/9/22,2022,8,9
Don’t work there ,If you think u would like working at Walmart think again. They are not there for u unless u are popular there. They make u work really hard which I didn’t mind cause it made the day go by faster. But if someone was out they will move u to another department.,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Anderson, SC",8/9/22,2022,8,9
Great people Steady hours,You'll get a lot of hours and promotions are easy to get and most of your managers and coworkers will be easy to work with. The job is simple but it can become repetitive.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Richmond, VA",8/9/22,2022,8,9
Great place to work ,"Come to Walmart and try it for your self.Great benefits, the pay is good they have different pay role from 14 dollars to 20 dollars an hour it depends on you and the the type of job you want.",5,Current Employee,Asset Protection Investigator ,New Hampshire,8/9/22,2022,8,9
Distribution Center #7036 I wouldn’t recommend it,"Personally I don’t think anyone should undergo as much stress like you do at this job, the pay doesn’t match up to the production you have to make which in order to make it you have to bust your butt the whole 12 hour shift. They really don’t care about you all they care about is hitting their numbers. The managers themselves undergo so much stress from the upper management that they have to treat their employees bad because of it. They really expect everyone to work like robots. But if doing an intense 12 hour workout is what you wanna do then you may like it. However there are positions there that are definitely manageable to do like DA receiving or power equipment positions are the only thing that I would recommend mostly DA, and also they have very few desk positions that you don’t have a production but they are extremely hard to get because you have to know people to get them. ",1,Current Employee,Unloader ,"Sealy, TX",8/9/22,2022,8,9
Fast Paced ,They always expect you to go above and beyond what you are expected to do. They change shifts without any notice and tell you that you need to work those hours no matter what your availability is. ,2,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup Associate ,"Estero, FL",8/9/22,2022,8,9
It sucked ,They will not move the hard working individuals but for some reason they move the oldest and slowest workers to the most active job position (LGP) rather than a young active person,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Van Buren, AR",8/9/22,2022,8,9
Fun place to work,The environment is like a typical store but the people are very nice. Management is always a available for questions and are very helpful. It’s a laid back environment.,5,Current Employee,Food and consumables AT ,"Independence, MO",8/9/22,2022,8,9

Could’ve been better ,"Started good as first job. But the progression system isn’t good. They don’t care about your personal life at all. Will over work you. Doctors notes and all that doesn’t matter, if you don’t show up to work They are mad. They have fired people I know while they were off of work. The associates are nice to eachother but have no problem stepping on people to get to the top and kissing butt ",2,Current Employee,Retail Associate ,"Owensboro, KY",8/9/22,2022,8,9
It's not bad ,Can be a great way to get your foot in the door with supervisor experiences and learn new things. Good company to grow with. Communication isn't always the best but its something they are working on. It's hard honest work. Not everyone is held accountable sometimes that can make things tough. Support depends on how you look at it. It's been good to me so far. ,3,Current Employee,Supervisor ,"Sartell, MN",8/9/22,2022,8,9

Pays well but has its issues ,Pay is good but we are chronically understaffed. The benefits through walmart are also quite nice.

Good enough,"Probably the best part about Walmart is how easy it is to get in, and how flexible the schedules can be. Wasn't uncommon to see my boss accommodate everyone. However, favoritism is pretty high, and all it takes is one or a few bad managers to ruin it for everyone. Also promotions are seldom handed out despite what Walmart says. I almost never saw new manager hires.",3,Current Employee,Fresh Sales Associate ,"Princeton, TX",8/9/22,2022,8,9
Good but repetitive ,Was a good place to work but got really repetitive and tiring. The pay is really good if this is your first job. You’ll have to carry heavy boxes and work in hot environments sometimes. ,3,Former Employee,Stocking Associate ,"Kansas City, KS",8/9/22,2022,8,9

"Busy, high-stress place but more tech hours than other chains","It’s retail pharmacy. Walmart has strong management and are very strict when it comes to opioids being dispensed. More and more metrics and responsibilities are being piled on top of pharmacists and the pay doesn’t rise at all. Overall, not a bad place to work and better than the other two more common retail pharmacy chains. Upper management seems to listen to concerns. Patient complaints are taken very seriously, even if they are unreasonable (it’s Walmart…).",3,Current Employee,Staff Pharmacist ,North Carolina,8/9/22,2022,8,9
Not bad,Its not bad the people (customers) are the worst part. The discount is nice although it doesn't work on food and other strange things. Pay is really good compared to the difficulty of the work,4,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,Florida,8/9/22,2022,8,9
Fun ,Easy paced. Need basic listening skills. Work days can be fast or slow depending on the work that needs done. Managers are casual not really much restriction on things. ,4,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Amelia, OH",8/9/22,2022,8,9

Great Benefits and Decent Pay for Slogging Work,"This may just be a me thing, and maybe I picked a job that was not right for me particularly, but working at Walmart was definitely a drain on my energy. Coworkers and supervisors were pretty alright as far as workplace relations go- I've never felt it was particularly ""friendly"" but it was also my first job. The corporate environment felt very soulless and lonely. I had leg problems for a bit because of a previous surgery, and when I was given a stool by another associate to sit on, my manager told me I wasn't allowed to have it and took it. Standing there for hours on end with customers treating you very poorly wasn't an experience I really hold dear, to be frank, but maybe I was just in the wrong job for myself as I had said earlier.",3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,Virginia,8/9/22,2022,8,9

Teamwork,A good place to work. Teamwork is a plus. Early morning hours so you can clock out and start your days at home. I learned how to use new technology. Managers are understanding. What I enjoyed most was helping customers in need of assistance.,5,Former Employee,Cap Team 1 ,"Gallup, NM",8/9/22,2022,8,9
Depends on location and management ,When I first started in 2018 the job was great but then it started to go down hill from the management side which lead to a lot of good associate & Assistant managers to departure. Also the pay could also be much more beneficial especially for some of the work that’s there ,2,Former Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,4301 S university Dr,8/9/22,2022,8,9

Demanding ,Staffing shortages and unreliable associates creates impossible demand and creates quick burnout for the good workers. Corporate demands completely unachievable with quantity and quality of current staffing.,3,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Racine, WI",8/9/22,2022,8,9
We were often understaffed. But overall I enjoyed working this job,Working at store 2607 in Polson Mt. Taught me alot about what I can achieve as an associate.  They have good management that encouraged teamwork and provided me  with the training I needed to be successful at my job. They encourage their associates in every aspect of their job so if you wanted to move up the management ladder you had all you needed to be successful.  I enjoyed working in the department I was in. I got to assist customers in their daily shopping needs and also help my fellow associates be successful in their jobs as well. The only complaint that I could have was that sometimes we were short staffed and it would make getting everything done more difficult.  But I always rose to the challenge. ,4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate deli/bakery ,36318 Memory Lane ,8/9/22,2022,8,9

Easy fun job ,I liked working here. Most co workers were nice but some gossiping and drama. Pay was decent and job is pretty easy. Can call off online without having to talk to anyone.

Dead End ,"There’s no reason to work here unless you want to work at the same position for years to come.

"Decent money, but wants ridiculous daily goals","Working at the distribution center isn't bad and the pay is decent. I am a hauler and I just scan pallets on the dock and then take them to the assigned isle so a lift operator can put them on the racks. The daily goal that they set for us is a little ridiculous and if you don't get 100% each day, then you get an occurrence, so many occurrences and your terminated. I don't know about the other jobs and their daily goals, but I've been told that the hauler's have the hardest daily goal which is 248 pallets in a 11.5 hour work day. I just don't like how they will give you an occurrence for doing 95% or above, because once you get so many, you can't put in for a shift change or a job change, which is ridiculous.

Poor management and Very Stressful,"The job itself wasn't bad but management was very discouraging. Instead of them explaining how the job worked, they would just yell at you. It was very mentally challenging working at Walmart. My mental health has severely decreased and there was not a day that I wasn't stressed.

Underpaid hard job,"It is not well paid.  They do not pay differentials for working weekends or night shifts.  It is a challenging job because you have to deal with customers at the same time that you make your purchase route.  It requires walking long distances, heavy lifting such as 6-gallon baskets of milk that weigh tons, or packs of water.  It's overwhelming you because you have customers stopping you all the time and you're up against the clock to complete your order and answer customer questions at the same time.  Customers don't give you room to move forward, many stop in the middle of the aisle and you have to drive the shopping cart in such a way that you don't bump into customers or you have to wait for them to move.  Many customers are disrespectful and expect you to quickly answer all their questions.  It's frustrating because you have to wait for customers to move to pick your products and continue your work.  In the aspect of liaison with the human resources office, it is non-existent.  Everything is automated and the initial orientation was terrible.  There is no one to turn to for questions about policies and procedures and there are many gray areas and little employee orientation.  There is no sense of team, in general everyone goes their own way.  They don't do regular employee meetings, so you have no sense of belonging to a team or to any company.  There is no special treatment for employees.  There are no specific restrooms for employees, so you have to use the restrooms for general customers, which are always disgusting.

"Good Management, Bad Work Environment","Walmart is obviously going to have its pros and cons, anyone who's been into one or seen the Walmart customer meme threads will know that there are ALL KINDS that shop at walmart, however, aside from having a good direct manager, the store managers and Corporate and all of the ""higher ups"" are little to no help, they seem to not take their jobs very seriously which reflects on how the store is ran and how the rest of the associates treat their job, as well as the overall environment and attitude when working with or around them. Not to mention, I've been working there almost a year and a half, and I haven't gotten one raise or any sort of incentive to stay or put any more effort into my work than the bare minimum like everyone else seems to be doing. All that to say, there are definitely some great people at Walmart, and if you're desperate or want a part time job for a little extra cash or a second job, this isn't a bad option, but go into it knowing you'll have to deal with some crazies and a lot of BS from upper management.",3,Current Employee,Sales Floor Team Member ,"Springfield, MO",8/8/22,2022,8,8

Great place to work,"The good thing about Walmart is they are always hiring and always have opportunities for everyone.

Management is never satisfied with your speed ,"The atmosphere is alright. I enjoy working when there’s a relaxed manager but no matter who’s working, you’re going to be told to pick up the pace.

Unreasonable demands and not enough stockers,"Management causes the job to be very stressful due to lots of freight of grocery items and general merchandise. It's always an overflow of items to stock and not enough overnight stickers to do it. There is a high turnover rate due to the unreasonable demands for stickers to stock all the merchandise on pallets and L carts, stock all return items, and zone the entire grocery department in 8 hours.

Flexible management and majority of associates are polite,The management is very flexible and understanding. Especially with time-off and breaks. Lots of my TLs tell me they appreciate it when I come into work and even provide us snacks out of their own money. Higher up in the management chain there are many good people but also very self absorbed ones too. But you can avoid them usually as they typically run the rest of the store and work on paper work and not always directly with associates. ,3,Current Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,Indiana,8/7/22,2022,8,7
unreal expectations,Management has unreal expectations and not enough employees to follow guidelines & keep the store clean and safe along with organized & properly stocked.Management supports you at first but then quickly turns on you & continues to keep employees who are disrespectful to team leads.  Great for overtime and starting pay is great.  If you can adapt to doing a sloppy job just to get the product on the floor.Very friendly coaches & other team leads helped & support you.

Just keep your head down and do your job,"You amount to nothing as a Walmart employee. They make it known that you're disposable and can be easily replaced.  This is a good place for kids to work and bitter adults who live for nothing else but Walmart. They pay fairly and that's all that keeps me there.  I work hard and work my job correctly and accurately and seem to get treated like garbage for that. The younger crowd who works at Walmart are a bunch of drama queens who like to start trouble for you. The older crowd is very rude and unwelcoming.  Plenty of brown nosing going on, plenty of playing favorites,  plenty of being misinformed if informed at all. I have one great team lead and if he wasn't there then I probably would have given up by now. The work is in no way difficult,  just requires some common sense and leg work. It's the co workers and management that is the problem. ",1,Current Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Bellingham, MA",8/7/22,2022,8,7

Lower level employees are not given very clear communication ,"In typical day-to-day the work was either the same monotonous task or something that I had not been trained for and had very few instructions beyond the basic employee training.  The management was doing their best but they were stretched too thin at our location and that led to some confusion.  The employees could not even see when other employees or management are in, so it could take a long time just trying to find the onsite management or anyone besides the lowest level employees.",2,Former Employee,Front End Associate ,"South Jordan, UT",8/7/22,2022,8,7
Other associates are nice but management and supervisors need improvement ,Management has lost touch with what is realistically possible for the base level associates.

"A pretty good place to work, actually.","I worked the night shift to stock, and the work was fun. It involved bringing large palettes from the back and stocking the shelves before the morning shift begins. It's slightly tricky, but anybody can do it as long as they're fast. People were pretty chill at the job, and the management was fair about stuff. They could be slightly strict about some things, but it depends on who you're working with.

Overworked,"Shipping department accounts for 30% of the turnover rate at the DC. You use a long conveyer system to load each trailer by hand, floor to sealing in a neat orderly fashion. What they don't tell you is the amount of TEAM LIFT FRIEGHT ranging from 75- almost 200lbs. Trailers are filthy with food and assorted substances from detergent to motor oil litters trailer floors and walls. When management finds out you can handle a fast set of lanes, they don't reward you for your hard work. They continue to keep you in high volume lanes, while the favorite employees normally work slower lanes or less physically demanding jobs. Management consists of men and women who don't help they're employees. They would rather sit in their air conditioned/heated office rather than be a leader and rally employees for a good work ethic.

A Family Company ,When I worked at Walmart I went through pregnancy and they made it so easy for me to pump breastmilk at work three times a day. They’re also very flexible.

Major life changing decisions every 2 years,"In over 19 years I've seen it all. Every 2 yrs when you get comfortable with a change they've made, they will change everything again and you'll be afraid you'll lose your position, pay or both and the chances are very real that this will happen to you eventually no matter your position. They will rename your position to something else, where you end up having to reapply for the position in order to move people around to where they want them. This has its pros when it has to do with poorly performing associates, but many cons when you have managers who have grudges and move people around based on the buddy system. For many years the company has provided me with competitive pay, and I've had several compassionate and professional managers. Unfortunately, that atmosphere has changed to elevating the ""yes men"" who question nothing, do not push back, and will not support their associates with any empathy. This creates some extreme toxicity and unnecessary workplace pettiness and conflict. Stores are not fully autonomous, but they are all a reflection of leadership unto themselves.  They will hire you with the promise of one schedule, and they will completely change it on you with little notice which is extremely hard on single parents and caregiving families. Communication is inconsistent at best, there is a lot of it, but it is not cohesive or easy to understand. It has become increasingly difficult for associates to advance and stay in their position, and more is required of them by the day.

I would never recommend being a cashier at walmart.

Better than CVS or Walgreens but still terrible,"Walmart is the best big retail chain pharmacy to work for as far as staffing and pay go - that said, the work environment is miserable. Some stores are better than others, but it's unfulfilling dead-end work that's best used as a means to an end. You reach your pay cap after about 3 years and there's no possibilities for advancement within the company unless you want to transfer to a management track position outside of the pharmacy. Walmart will pay for you to get licensed and nationally certified - once you've got enough experience to get a better job somewhere less miserable there's absolutely no reason to stay. The career techs I've met are making barely more than new hires and have little to show for their time with Walmart. The better pharmacies I've worked in have a little bit of camaraderie and the day flies by even though the work never slows down even for a second, the worst are an absolutely miserable slog full of miserable people dragging everyone else down with them.

Then they change me and the others techs schedules so they can force us to stay open till 7 when they could easily just hire someone but the Managers haven’t even tried to hire anybody. No time to take a 15 minute break cause the cars don’t stop coming in, some of us have taken 30 minutes on lunch instead of an hour just to catch up on work.

Your mileage may vary. It's going to be whatever you make it. But I give it two out of five stars.,"Your mileage may vary. Whether your experience is positive or negative will likely be determined more based upon who you work for, rather than where you work.For the most part, management is pretty good; however there are a couple of supervisors that are so bad they decrease the moral and attitude of everyone around them and create a negative atmosphere.The work life balance isn't great because hours and shifts tend to change a lot; especially around the holidays. Almost all time off requests are automatically denied surrounding holidays and key event days. Overtime may be authorized in the lead up to a major holiday, but hour cuts will follow as soon as the holiday is over.The pay and benefits aren't terrible, but it could definitely be better. Especially the way paid time off is accrued. Full time associates get a decent accrual rate for paid time off, however part time associates receive much less even if they are working similar hours. Your accrual rating is directly associated to whether or not you are coded as a full time or part time associate.The job culture is okay, it's convenient how many stores there are around the country; so transferring isn't too difficult if you want to move somewhere else. But it is ironic that the company quotes Sam Walton's tips for success while actively walking away from them at the same time.I would say that job advancement is good, but job security is bad; high turnover is definitely a thing and the company prides itself on having a revolving door of applicants.Overall, it's going to be whatever you make it; but I give it two - more...",2,Former Employee,Formerly Full Time ,"Stafford, VA 22556",8/5/22,2022,8,5

Good First Job but Poor Management,"I liked working here because of the coworkers and I enjoyed the break schedule and the freedoms of cart pushing. It could be hard work but if you managed your time well there would be plenty of downtime, as long as there were no managers around to force you to do busy work that would then turn your actual job into a game of catch-up. I would put my headphones in and just focus on the job, or chat with my coworkers as we collected carts. That said, there was no reward for doing your job well other than a pat on the back and maybe more responsibility because they know you're the only one capable. This made many employees very lazy because they were not held accountable nor had any incentive to do better.

There's no designated trainers or anything. And ""training"" is only lasts for that first day. There's horrible communication from management and some of the managers just straight up ignore you. The pay was super good for part time, but the hours are insane. 10pm- 7am usually and managers tend to be lazy with your availability. Job is physically taxing which I didn't have a problem with but its very easy to drain all your energy after a few weeks of working. Had to quit because my depression got 30x worse working here.

Which can be frustrating at first, but I haven't personally had issues with any management I worked for. Overall enjoyed my time here, although as a team lead, the only notable frustration that comes to mind was how you may have to assist other areas of the store that is not your own, when I have never been trained in that specific area. I'm always willing to learn, but never really had the opportunity before being told that day I need to go up there. Made me feel like I had to cross my fingers and hope customers don't ask for something I'm not as familiar with or else I'd have to drag upper management.

"Unproductive, wasteful, and careless","Disorganized managers, leaving new hires clueless as to what is expected of them and what work to complete.

Okay for a first job,"Started as a seasonal stocker, after 3 months got promoted to department manager. Management is hit or miss; I’ve worked at 2 stores. Most recent store was a disaster after grand opening. Spent months setting up the store from the ground up; as a DM I loved interacting with the customers and building relationships with my coworkers but was denied a promotion because I “lacked time management” when it was just me running 2 departments solo and management always hiring associates for other areas of the store but not mine. I was expected to do the work of 3 different job titles all in my 8 hour shift and with no extra compensation. You are expected to work all holidays except Christmas. Money is the bottom line, they are a corporation after all. Also, favoritism; they promote who they like the most. ",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Mount Laurel, NJ",8/4/22,2022,8,4
They work you to exhaustion,"The only good thing about Walmart is the insurance benefits. Unless you are some level of upper management, you are expected to work yourself to the point of injury. Then not get covered for said injury because it wasn't an accident caused injury. I've been with the company almost two years and I can tell just how little they care for their associates. They have little regard for your home life, your physical health, or your mental health. The only thing this company cares about is numbers.

draining,"I worked as a money services associate at two different locations. The first location in Mississippi was ok, but the second location in New Orleans is terrible.

"Stressful, Aggressive work environment ","The best part of working for Walmart is the people you will meet (other associates). It helped me grow socially and get out of my usual quiet comfort zone. Other than the relationships with the people there, I would not recommend working for this company full-time or long term. I’ve been to multiple stores, been managed by countless different people. All experiences were the same. As someone who promoted within the company, Ive first hand experienced management blatantly breaking company policy (marking things down for other managers (our store manager even), giving associates false information on the PTO and PPTO policies to avoid them calling out, moving people to different departments they’ve never worked (without the consent of the associate before hand), threatening to write up associates for not staying late to finish work that is not theirs, threatening associates with write ups for using sick time, even though it’s against policy to do so. There is also obvious mistreatment of specific individuals in the stores as well, i.e. favoritism. It is a very corrupt management structure, that I am ashamed to say I was a part of. This is a job i’d only recommend as a placeholder or part time thing. The culture is to do whatever you’re told, and stay quiet. There are policies Walmart has about “retaliation”, but you quickly see, no matter which store you work at, EVERY hourly associate there is afraid to speak out because of mistreatment and distrust for management. The distrust is deserving, as most of salaried management are friends with everyone in your specific market, meaning - more...",1,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"San Tan Valley, AZ",8/4/22,2022,8,4

In 2021 they started issuing occurrences if you did not achieve100% of the production rate for your role.  This resulted in most associates focusing on rate instead of quality.  We missed our quality bonus and on time bonuses the last 2 qtrs I worked there.  I found management open to suggestions for improvement.

Management is no help in this department, their response to these issues is, ""Oh yeah that always happens, and nothing can be done to correct it, or it comes with the territory."" Another thing is the self made, unwritten, rules by some members of management, such as asking them to use the computers to do CBL's, which they consistently pressure you to get done, so when you're in there working on them, they walk in and verbally reprimand you and your coworkers about their unwritten rule that you never heard of.

"Unhelpful Management, Store Felt Unsafe At Times",It was a stressful job with unclear rules and other rules that only made customers angry and our job more difficult. The store was in need of security for shoplifters and customers who made threats and behaved aggressively with other employees. Management needed to actually enforce tobacco and alcohol policies rather than simply allowing people to throw a fit and get away with not showing their IDs. Busy store and yet no one was called to help at the front or when someone was in need of assistance in a department. Lack of employees and communication was a huge problem. Manager was often absent.

Strong workers are not acknowledged. They nearly treated as the weakest link in their department.  I rarely hear a ""thank you""  or ""you're doing a good job,"".  I feel it's important for the moral of the team in each department to feel appreciated and to be acknowledged.  I do that to my team daily.... Even though I'm not a team leader.  Just a worker doing my job. But management does not see it that way. Moral is very important for employees and for the company.  When moral goes down... Workers feel disenchanted.

Not so fun,They  don't  care  to  accommodate  for  workers  with  disabilities.  The  management  is  lacking  in  empathy  and  concern  towards  their  employees. ,2,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Cottonwood, AZ",8/3/22,2022,8,3

Pay is good.... because it's the only way they retain management,"Walmart management pay is pretty good, and the bonus structure is great. Be prepared to spend 70+ hours at work. Often times 6 days. There is no work/life balance. The biggest annoyance is the ""fire drills"" that come up often do to lack of planning from home office. The hours given to complete the work is way under even what Walmarts own systems say it should take.",2,Former Employee,Store Lead  ,Florida,8/3/22,2022,8,3
Not for everyone.,"Some people love working there, not everyone does. Dunno if it varies store to store. Over all you're more or less secure in your job, don't get sick though. Half of what they give you to cover it is only PER YEAR, so if you have any kinda mental health troubles or health issues in your family...you're screwed.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Sand Springs, OK",8/3/22,2022,8,3
Stressful but not the worst ,The job itself was fun. Everyday was a different iteration of the set of tasks which really helped reduce risk of burn out. When I took the position I knew it would be momentary however I had hoped to stay longer than I did. The stress of job insecurity wasn't worth it. The store I worked for did not communicate amongst management which trickled down to the hourly employees who would then be held accountable. I was tired of fearing termination for my bosses mistake. ,3,Former Employee,Walmart personal shopper ,"Alma, AR",8/3/22,2022,8,3

"Poor Management, Unprofessionial, Good Pay","While the pay is good even for my position, and the work is incredibly easy, management makes it worthless.

Management is pretty bad,The managers don’t take the time to understand what is happening that day or to find out if you need help. They just see spots on the shelves not filled and want it done NOW. If someone didn’t show up for their shift most managers have no idea and don’t care that you now have to pick up the slack.

"Coworkers are often amazing, management not so much.","Management is very pushy to the point they push their employees to other employers by not caring about employees. It was a good place until for whatever reason that changed and now it’s all about times and the treatment of one shift is completely different than the other two shifts which is completely unfair. It’s the classic middle child treatment of that one shift, everything that goes wrong is their fault because it just is. The other two can do no wrong when they do everyday. We aren’t treated as people but more as machines. 100% very unhappy there and it’s mentally and physically draining and I don’t recommend to anyone.

I wouldnt suggest this job to my worst enemy,"BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CANT DOWNSTACK, SCAN, AND STOCK 18 PALLETS OF FREIGHT BY YOURSELF IN 8 HOURS?!

Not recommended ,"Man, I've never disliked working anywhere more. I'm not even sure where to start. Initially when I got hired during training they informed you how they would like everything to be done. When you get on the floor they basically tell you you don't have enough time to do it the way you're trained to. It's all about how quick you can throw things on the shelf. They literally sat us down and let us know we're nothing more than numbers on a paper and Walmart has no problem firing us. Their current covid policy, well it does follow current CDC guidelines, is a joke. I was told I should come to work while I have covid as long as I have a mask. And it's not an excused absence and I have to take a leave of absence. Which they don't have to approve. You can't simply turn in a doctor's note if you're sick. It's this long convoluted process. Also, they cut my hours to non livable wages. The company has no reasoning why they can't afford to pay the employees they hired. I personally feel retaliated against because my hours got cut as soon as I got sick. I wish I never worked here because I used to like shopping there",2,Current Employee,Fresh cleaner ,"Payson, UT",8/2/22,2022,8,2
It’s not worth it,"Too much favoritism; managers don’t want to discipline bad employees which forces the good ones to be overworked and quit.

At the end of the day a job is a job,"And in my experience that's how you treat Walmart when you work for them they help when they can but expect way too much they do offer programs down the line that can be beneficial to most not all and they are very lenient for those who have kids or medical conditions at the end of the day you work, you get paid. Bada bing Bada boom! Now in all seriousness there is a major lack of communication all throughout all levels of management.",3,Current Employee,O/N Stocker ,"Hilliard, OH",8/2/22,2022,8,2
Ok job if your in high school or college ,"Been working at walmart since I was 17, now 20 I can tell you I have reached my limit. Some of my coworkers are great and are the ones that keep me sane, maybe it's because there are tons of younger associates. While the other associates are the ones that clearly dont pull there own wait just to make it harder on everyone else, but i guess that is with every job. The pay is ok I guess but living off of it is a no go. Me being paid 14.50 to be basically do almost everything around the store since we are always ""short staffed"". The management is not particularly terrible but are about as useful as slapping a bandaid on a bullet wound. Constantly being bombarded be unrealistic expectations that clearly can't be done. Just to remedy it with staying later than your designated time. I can't remember the last time I actually left when I was supposed to. Depending on the department you work in you can never be garunteed adequate work hours to pay your bills if you have any. Me being part time is basically the holy grail to management since they can make you stay longer. All I can say is that it's not a terrible job if you go to school that's primarily why I stayed so long they worked with my school schedule since I drive to Ucf in Orlando for it which is about an hour and some change.",3,Current Employee,Associate ,"Ocala, FL",8/2/22,2022,8,2
Job not good,"Walmart is a absolutely HORRIBLE place to work. Especially for people with disabilities, children, or who are going to school. I’ve worked at three different locations a s they all treat their employees the same. If you apply for part time, expect to work full time hours. They do this so they don’t have to give you benefits.

Fun crew. Awful schedule ,"The work is rather easy once you get the hang of it all.  You're much better off as a teenager here in a low expectations position.  You can call in, show up late, and get what you want schedule-wise.  Any sort of management position requires many, many nights and weekends.

Horrible place to work,Constantly giving raises/bonuses and taking away later on. Treats pharmacy staff like McDonald's employees. Not worth getting licensed or certified to only meet corporate metrics.,1,Current Employee,Pharmacy Technician ,Illinois,8/1/22,2022,8,1
Summary,"Not a bad place, could use some less restrictions during work. Overall good for those that are starting out and are looking for work. Mostly tiresome due to not being able to listen to music on your phone. Night shift for a more peaceful time or for those that sleep in the day.",3,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Houston, TX",8/1/22,2022,8,1
Grind and Double Speak,"The upper management started using any concepts that were brought up as a barrier, as the lead-in to conversations. Example “Besides not having enough help, what are some things that are stopping your success in getting to X number of immunizations per day?”Also the “numbers didn’t matter” but in actuality, that is all that mattered.

Workplace ,The job has a lot of parts to it but once you learn everything it’s easy. The customers are usually pretty good to get along with. The management isn’t the best. It’s like an high school environment.,3,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Whiteville, NC",8/1/22,2022,8,1
It was alright,"It is what it is, low pay and hours that weren’t really flexible. I would def go for another position within the store but it was a decent place to start",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rogers, AR",8/1/22,2022,8,1
Long hours and no recognition,"I was excited to work as a Personal Shopper when I first started. The job seemed easy enough and there wasn’t much to it. Not long after starting, I realized that no matter how much work you put in, it would never be enough for management. Overtime was expected. They never ASKED people to stay late, yet would berate us for leaving when scheduled. On busy days they would say “I’ll take whatever extra time you can give us!” But like stated above, would berate the people who weren’t able to stay late. Instead of praising the people who consistently performed well, they shunned the whole team if a few people performed mediocre. We were consistently understaffed, yet they kept the department orders at 100% potential capacity with only about 20% of the staff expected to man the department. This wasn’t a problem until around the time I started looking at leaving. Every military payday was a dumpster fire. We got too many orders to keep up with, so the back room started to get disorganized, which set everything back because it was hard to find orders. The air conditioning was down for months, which made it miserable to work it because it was constantly 80+ degrees in the store. The open door policy here is a joke, I heard team leads and managers talking to each other about what employees would come talk to them about in a joking and condescending manner. Don’t work here. Or at the very least not the personal shopper department. Most toxic place I’ve ever worked. ",1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Hinesville, GA",8/1/22,2022,8,1
Decent job,Definitely a good starter job. The pay has gotten better recently. Management can be annoying sometimes but if you can get past that you should be fine. Personally I would never try to make it a career though,3,Current Employee,Seasonal TA ,Virginia,8/1/22,2022,8,1

Very boring and tedious work,"The job consisted of unloading trailers with a stand-up forklift, except you had to pull the pallets apart and form new pallets containing one product, so from one pallet you might have to make 10 new ones. The trailers also might have no pallets and all boxes, where you would need to match them or sometimes could put them all together.",1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Menomonie, WI",8/1/22,2022,8,1
Hostile work environment,You get paid for a one person job but are expected to the work of four people. Management doesn’t know how to treat their associates like humans rather than robots.

"Good Coworkers, Manager Sucked",Coworkers we're really cool though the manager sucked at communicating with us.  Customer service is always a smile no matter what's going on around you. ,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,Mississippi,8/1/22,2022,8,1
"Decent pay & benefits, terrible management","Cons: Management constantly disorganized, overloaded, and changing. Communication sucks. Same with policy/procedure. Higher upper management completely out of touch/rude/fake smile types. Lack of equipment for all employees. Sometimes depending on who does schedules you’ll have someone doing it who is inflexible and make it impossible to get a schedule that works well for you or get important dates off (some weren’t bad about it though). Pros: decent pay for retail gig, decent benefits for full time employees, lots of breaks. Always opportunities for advancement if that’s something you want. Job itself itself isn’t bad, and the benefits are good for retail work, but management/lack of consistency/communication leaves a LOT to be desired.

Literally, they would talk with somebody 5 feet away from me, then absolutely ignore me.  This would happen almost every shift.It is okay if I am not an easy person to talk to, but they made it very, very clear they did not want me around them.They did not even try to make me feel welcome. I actually have a disability, a of which they were aware, and they treated me poorly.This was most of the time . . .

Long term associate ,First off let me say Walmart has been good to me I started in 2013 and decided after 9 years to move on. Management is the problem hands down. The old saying is it starts at the top and that is very true. If they like you they will promote you as high as they can possibly go if on the other hand you speak your mind and honest about rhe problems you are having you will be forever a funky. That being said I did stay 9 years and would do so again but the last year the company has went a direction that most of us long term associates do not like. It's all about throwing people at a problem instead of working with the people you have and helping them when needed.,4,Current Employee,TLE Service Technician ,Texas,8/1/22,2022,8,1

Terrible place to work and do not pay fair wages,Management is a joke they do not do their jobs people that have been there a few months prior to you think they can stand around and do nothing. Your pay is a joke based on the work you have to do. Your team lead will never be in your department helping you they will be any and everywhere else. Would not recommend working at any Walmart.

You get what you make of it. ,Every job is going to have their bs. You get what you make of it.  I've been there over 5 yrs & love it here.  It was supposeed to been a temporary thing when I started as a Flex associate (seasonal). To where I worked my way up pretty fast once they know you'll be there & give your best.  I recommend to every one especially when I hear the wages ppl are dealing with at other places.  Starting pay walking in the door with no experience is $20 / hr. With 50 cent raise every 6 months for the first couple yrs. Depending of shift & dept can take up close to the $30 range a hr.

"Manipulative, no compassion from management.","There was mutable times that I have made it clear to management that I am diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, and depression. I was met with 0% empathy or compassion from them. In fact, the only people who treated me with any kind of respect where 2 team leads and that was it. I severely struggled with getting an entire departments worth of work done with barely any help while on top of that, having other team leads from different departments come over and pull me away from my work to go and start on over things. Ten I get to get reprimanded for not finishing the work I had to do in my original department.  Sometimes upper management and curtain team leads would click up together, then choose a lone employee to gang up on. there is absolutely nothing that could make me ever want to work there again. Many people quit that place and now I know why. ",2,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Elkton, MD 21921",7/31/22,2022,7,31
Weird Management ,"where to begin, they will constantly nitpick over small things,they dont train you long enough as the months go on you learn as you go.

Work Culture there is unprofessional there are certain team leads who care about work ethics and organization while theirs other team leads show favoritism to those  they get along with more better. They don't really care about their associates just as long as someone is there doing the job that's all that matters to the company. they expect their associates to do above and beyond to the point where want you to have time requested off.

Just a paycheck.. management needs some overhauling ,"Before the change in front end personnel, it was an enjoyable place to work.

The management i ended up with up front working cashier was nice and understanding, worked with my personal schedule but also that meant being bumped down in pay.

"Nice pay, but not enough for the work you do","You should get paid more for the work you do, but the job is ok.  I loved working with certain coworkers. You get two 15 minute breaks. Some of my coworkers said they don’t pay you for overtime, meaning if you worked 3 hours over, they’ll tell you to leave 3+ hours early another day or take an extended lunch or something like that. Some managers are cool and others allow their position titles to make them feel cocky. ",3,Former Employee,Stocker/Receiver ,"Greenwood, MS",7/31/22,2022,7,31

Average pay but poor culture and no work life balance,"Working for Walmart as a store project coach was depressing. As a salary store project coach you have no work life balance. On the job you are required to work 12+ hours on remodel projects. On the road you will be planning out counter moves, reading blue prints, leading and supervising a third party crew of 30+ people overnight. This role requires 100 percent mobility. As a store project coach you will travel on a team of 3-4 or individually from state to state to complete Walmart remodel projects. As an external hire it’s hard to learn the job because with the store project coach position there is no training. External hires don’t know the Walmart language and it’s difficult to adapt. The Walmart academy have some resources to help you but it’s impossible to constantly scan through all their data to find help. The job requires you to think fast and problem solve. There is little to no help from your fellow SPCs. You will have to network, ask questions, or learn as you are faced with adversity. Most SPCs on the job don’t support their fellow workers and will sabotage your efforts. Accountability in this role is very important. Almost everybody play the blame game and never own up to mistakes. Constantly check your morals. Lastly the work culture / environment at times is toxic and dangerous due to teammates, and some times third party workers fighting, stabbing each other, and even stealing from the store. As for the pros, the job has good benefits, and  Walmart academy. ",2,Former Employee,Store project coach ,"Ames, IA",7/31/22,2022,7,31

Greedy Company With Horrible Management ,"An extremely greedy company that has cut it's employees in half and forced them to do more work than they are paid to do, while promoting people who are terrible managers and giving them the bonuses they took away from the people who are actually doing the job.

Awful scheduling with no consistency. Sometimes associates get 4 hrs. a week, other times they get 40. Management will schedule you at the last minute from time to time and expect you to drop everything else in your life. 3. Horrible moral and difficulty getting time off. For example, they don't care if it's your grandma's funeral. They will still deny your request.4. Benefits are not great. It takes a long time to accrue PTO. Low pay.

"Used to love it, now I can't stand the thought of it","The pay is good. The upper management could use some tweaking. They will ask questions and then completely disregard the answer you give. They do not care about input from lower level management. Dayshift gets preferential treatment from management while night shift gets blamed for everything, including not fixing the problems dayshift creates. Maintenance is expected to execute flawlessly at night and deliver an immaculate store despite having to clean up behind a whole supercenter full of stockers who create messes after we clean the areas, while dayshift gets praised for cleaning up behind customers who aren't nearly as messy as associates.

It's all about your coworkers,"Walmart is a corporation that keeps cutting corners as much as they can and keep making decisions that leave you scratching your head. The main thing I enjoyed while working here was the solidarity between myself and my coworkers and the fact that management did their best for the most part to help us. The absence policy is better than a lot of places and yet somehow worse: they use a point based occurrence system that, upon reaching 5 points, will get you fired. Being late/leaving early is 0.5, an absence is 1, a no-call is 2, and on predetermined ""key event days"" (usually holidays/weekends before holidays) those points are doubled. No holiday pay... only consequences for not showing up. And these points last for 6 months from the day you acquire them. This is where PPTO comes into play. The extra P stands for ""Protected"" and it's time you slowly earn as you work that can be used to cover absences and coming in late, no questions asked. It's incredibly handy, but even at full time you'll only get about an hour of it every week. I worked there for almost 3 years and I've only seen policies and workplace structure get worse. It's an alright starter job depending on where you're working, but I don't recommend anything long-term. ",3,Former Employee,Seasonal Team Member ,"Canandaigua, NY",7/29/22,2022,7,29

"It's good with benefits, but gonna work the mess out you and understaffed","Bad turnover rate, not enough employees to do work effectively. Management/leads were non existing when needing help as a new employee.

Needs to get better at training hands-on, then maybe their turnover rate would decrease. ",2,Former Employee,Walmart Stocker ,"Kernersville, NC",7/29/22,2022,7,29

Workload was easy. Management made it difficult.,"The job was fast paced and easy to do. The pay was also amazing since we had gained 3 pay raises in the span of 4 months.Management was either slacking off or made our jobs much more difficult.Store was filthy and some of the products had expired or molded, but management would tell us to turn a blind eye and sell the items any way.

Overworked with unrealistic expectations ,I feel this job works you to death and then throws you away when there done using you.

I definitely would NOT recommend anyone work here; unless you don’t care about how much work you put into things to just get replaced. ,1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Etters, PA",7/29/22,2022,7,29
"Awful workplace, poor management, overworked employees, and more","Overall Walmart is a great place to go shopping but behind the scenes is a hot mess. Employees are forced to arrive to work no earlier than time scheduled, arriving early would add a point to your record. After 4 points you are terminated from your position. After clocking in CAP 2 would unload truck, which doesn't sound bad, however, the poor communication skills from management and other higher powered employees results in what can be best described as clustered mess of product movement. The managers do not care how the product is gotten off of the truck as long as it gets done before the night shift clock's in. A majority of the time it takes atleast 5 hours to unload a truck that should be unloaded in 2. In the time left the CAP 2 employees must franticly sort and put away the products before they have to clock out. Clocking out early results in a point as described earlier, clocking out even a minute late is the same. Products are often damaged in this process and it is a very inefficient way of conducting business. Corporate policy and management are entirely to blame as the workers are only following their instructions",1,Former Employee,Walmart Cap 2 Associate ,"Millersburg, OH",7/28/22,2022,7,28

We all pretty much know...,"Walmart is always an interesting place to work, mainly due to customers. You'll have angry ones, chatty ones, and sometimes weird ones.

I had really nice coworkers that made my time better.",4,Former Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Danville, VA",7/28/22,2022,7,28
Sucks. ,"Between the in store management and the customers, it sucks. Working at Walmart wasn’t all I thought it was gonna be. Sure the pay is okay, but the customers are able to walk all over you and management is the same. If you aren’t a favorite, then you get the poor end of the stick 24/7. The point system is WACK. 5 points in a 6 month period. Kids sick? Stuck in the hospital? Wrecked your car? Leg broken in 3 places? No ride? Well that’s just too dang bad. If you don’t have the PPTO to cover it, you are getting a point. 5 points & you’re gone. They do NOT accept doctors excuses whatsoever. We are allowed to requested days off, but half the time they aren’t approved. In (my) Walmart, the customer is always right pretty much. They could be screaming at you until they are blue in the face but you still have to sit there and take it. Cursing you up & down. They are still right. The amount of bad hands we are dealt are ridiculous.",3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Hammond, LA",7/28/22,2022,7,28

Terrible management ,"This has to be the worst place I have ever worked at. the managers play favorites, they micromanage everything you do, the make rumors about you and spread them around the store.

Upper Management is Horrible ,"I worked there a month, had flexible hours but HR and Hiring never wanted to work with positions… always gave the excuse that they need to fill my position even though people were getting brought in.

Only care about higher up management,As working they did not care if you were sick or not. Don't do accommodations. Rude management talked to you like you were a 2 year old.

"Decent Job, but too many metrics","The job itself is pretty easy and not terrible, but there are so many goals and metrics to keep track of, some of which are in direct opposition to one another. Management kind of just chooses a metric or two to freak out about every couple weeks and that’s all you’ll hear about until another metric drops and then they’ll switch it over. I loved my coworkers and direct supervisors, but it felt like the goal posts were constantly moving and it got exhausting and frustrating by the end.",3,Former Employee,Ecommerce Personal Shopper ,"Hanover, PA",7/28/22,2022,7,28
Biased ,"Put up the front that you can’t switch to other positions but have seen new hires bounce from department to department.

"Great at first, but then……","It goes without saying that Cart Pusher is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to jobs at Walmart so keep your expectations low, at least in terms of happiness. The weather is the worst part as you have to be out there in the boiling sun, pouring rain or freezing snow. I went an entire rainy shift with no hoodie and not a single member of management offered me a raincoat or even a poncho. The workers there make no effort to be your friend and hardly an effort at being a friendly co worker. There is a constant “I’m better then you” vibe from management that makes you feel even more unwelcome. The customers are obviously rude, inconsiderate, and entitled but it’s Walmart so that’s common. Hard work is also hardly noticed and rarely ever complimented, but as a cart pusher, you feel under appreciated alot. The pay however is good and the benefits are decent. But it doesn’t seem to make up for an unwelcome social work environment, unforgiving weather, ungrateful conceited management and rude customers.

Started out good,"When I first started out with Walmart it was good and I enjoyed it and felt like I was cared for. But, by my 8th month I've been actively looking for another job. Management has their favorite people and aren't afraid to show it. Toxic environment when you are forced to work alone but your fellow coworkers in your department are working together. Literally, had the coach ask me what I had been doing all day in front of everyone because I didn't get a task done when I was busy working returns for two departments as well as doing my regular duties. Basically, management doesn't care about you. They say they do but when it comes down to it they only think about themselves. They have their favorite associates and those are the ones that get the easy jobs, don't have to work as hard, and basically have freedom. The ones who aren't favorites are forced to do everything that no one else wants to do, they are on the outside looking in.

Its a good paying job but stressful,I worked there for almost a year and ended up quitting because I felt very stressed and overworked.

You can get paid well if you’re nice and work hard,With overtime it was easy to make 100k being hourly. Direct supervisors  were always willing to help of you were also helpful.

"Horrible Management, drama, understaffed.","Management may as well be non existent, I only worked with one other guy for second shift in meat/produce for months with no effort at all to hire new people.

Not ideal.,"The people I worked with were fun and upbeat, but the worst part was having our schedule change every two weeks. You might work at 11pm at night and go in the next morning. You got 3 sick days a year, but because I was interacting with the public and handling all the groceries they've handled, I got sick frequently and had to show up sneezing and coughing in front of customers. I never otherwise get ill or take days off work for other types of jobs.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Omaha, NE",7/26/22,2022,7,26

Help customers with their glasses,"The location where I worked was not a good environment. The manager that hired me cared about the employees as people. The manager that took over after that manger transferred is ineffective and cares about themselves more than anything. They are very melodramatic and two-faced. There was a lot of back biting while I was there. There was no sense of team work. The Dr is difficult to get along with and wants everything her way. Walmart itself had decent benefits. Pay was not great. Health and wellness (which is separate from the rest of Walmart) management expects you to up-sell patients and keep up with sales numbers. They also have ridiculous rules in H&W areas; like you cannot have food or drink in optical, even in the back office area, you cannot have a bag/purse with personal belongings either. I would say stay away from Walmart unless you would enjoy being miserable. ",1,Former Employee,Optician ,"Indianapolis, IN",7/26/22,2022,7,26
"Laid back, but unorganized",Management is not the best. Expect to be placed on the schedule less than 24 hours on the day you were originally scheduled off. The back room is chaos.,3,Current Employee,Stocking Associate ,2100 SE Loop 410,7/26/22,2022,7,26
U get lost in the mix ,The only traing they have is through a video.they run on a point system if you are absent or if you leave early. Ur max of points is 5 then your terminated.

Expectations at this company are way too high. They don't like having older people work for them.,"I was always RUSHED!.There was always some manager taking me off whatever task I was busy with and putting me on another detail. If you appeared to have nothing to do, a manager would find something for you to do.Their expectations were impossible. I was asked everyday why certain things didn't get done the night before and when I said we were short handed that wasn't considered a valid excuse.

Only good when management chooses,Ive worked at walmart for over a year and ive seen it under two different store managers the first manager was a leader and helper he really made the store feel like a team but since they replaced half the people in the store things have taken a turn for the worst management targets people who start calling out the lack of team work or care for the store any issues you report would be ignored because the stocking teams didnt know how to clean up the mess they make thats also apart of there jobs to put boxes and plastic that the items for the store were shipped in all over the floors stuffed into shelfs and even stuffed into products on the floor just cause we sell trash cans doesnt mean you fill them with trash before selling if the store manager is a good one youll have a good job and a good time working but if you got a bad manager start putting out applications cause they will add unneeded stress to your life that isnt apart of the job,2,Current Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Boothwyn, PA",7/26/22,2022,7,26

Corrupt Management ,"The management at walmart is definitely the reason why a lot of people don’t stay. If you are not buddy buddy with management, none of your requests will get done. All of the stores are sloppy with inventory negative in the thousands . Management could not care less about whats broken what isn’t working , all they care about is the orders they give you, work here if you need a couple bucks or rent paid, but if you’re looking for an enjoyable fun everyday job THIS IS NOT IT !",1,Current Employee,Night Shift Maintenance Technician ,"Fort Wayne, IN",7/26/22,2022,7,26

Walmart is a terrible place to work,They dont appreciate people and the company is based around favoritism. The managers have no idea what they are doing and are often on vacation or just not doing anything. The pay for the job is actually really low when you consider everything that is expected. Terrible workplace environment also.I worked at the Walmart on gateway road. Personal Shopper ,1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Columbus, GA",7/26/22,2022,7,26
Great environment ,It was a great first job I still to this day wish I was still there the managers are great and very hard workers and extremely understanding I returned after maternity leave after having to recover for a extra few weeks and was cut down to two days only working weekends and then learned that I was only going to work weekends and that was the only reason they hired me in the first place so I quit ,4,Former Employee,Walmart Supercenter⁹ ,"Alma, AR",7/26/22,2022,7,26

Decent job. Better pay than most places,"I worked in OGP. I mostly shopped. I didn't mind. It was my favorite thing. Loading cars and sorting orders kind of sucked. They tried to rotate people but it just ran more efficiently with keeping people around who actually knew what they were doing. Most days were busy, almost always something to shop. If not you just stocked shelves. Working weekends was mandatory, so that was hard for me as a mom, but they worked with me so I only had a early (4am-9am) shift on the weekends I had to work. I still got almost 40hrs/wk even though I was only part time. Most of my coworkers and my direct managers were really nice and worked with my schedule(I was also pregnant at the time, had drs appts). Overall a decent place to work. I'd say advancement would take some time though.",4,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Saratoga Springs, UT",7/26/22,2022,7,26
decent place,It is very chill to work. The job is not hard. You hear a good pay at first but it doesn't feel like it when you first start working because after awhile they start shortening your hours to something that you requested. The managers are okay just depends on which one is on the shift. ,3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Snellville, GA",7/26/22,2022,7,26
Management is horrible ,"Management is horrible and tend to favor those who ""brown nose"" and they lack compassion and listening skills.

Management is terrible. ,"You are just a number, management will make you do other people's jobs ( that pay higher than yours) and threaten to fire you if you don't.

Worst Job to Have,"Not a bad job. If it weren’t for the management. Bosses who punish you for calling in with late lunches and early breaks.

Toxic work environment ,Terrible management. If you are a hard worker you will be punished for it by doing everyone’s work.

No work life balance ,Some of the mangers had a harder time schedule people hours for example say if your shift is 2pm-11pm but the next day you have a 6am-2pm. Overall working at Walmart was a “Okay” or “Meh” experience it was bad or good. My suggestion for people who are wondering to apply is to figure out your work life balance.,3,Former Employee,Front End Associate ,"Sanford, FL",7/25/22,2022,7,25

Great entry level and endless opportunity to move up if dedicated.,"Who your manager is will have the biggest effect on you. Having a good manager will lead to your happiness in the dept and success in moving up with the right training and encouragement. If management is not ideal and work culture is toxic, I suggest informing your People Lead and upper store management before moving depts or store's if you don't find the right fit at one store. You can truly make a career out of Walmart. There is always so much more than what you see on the surface.

Managers and other employees,The manager do not help at all and expect you to get an unreasonable amount of work done in a shift with a skeleton crew. The other employees are also lazy and go missing through out the shift and don't get reprimanded for it.,1,Current Employee,Night Shift Stocker ,"Maysville, KY",7/25/22,2022,7,25

Absolutely Horrible,"Management doesn’t care about you at all. I witness a coworker die on site and they left him for 10 hours.

Don’t waste your time or mental health on this company.",1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Wichita, KS",7/25/22,2022,7,25
Bad Management ,My experience with management is that they will always tell you what you want to hear when it comes to addressing problems and concerns but there will never be any follow through. Regular Walmart associates and team leads do 99.9% of the work just for management to tell them that they never do it fast enough. And don’t bother asking for a day off.,1,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"Spring Branch, TX",7/25/22,2022,7,25

Depending on store,The store I worked at was unprofessional. The way they communicated with their employees was degrading. Work was too much for the amount of pay. At walmart you work in EVERY department no matter how much more money they make. ,1,Current Employee,Seasonal Sales Associate ,"Norfolk, VA",7/25/22,2022,7,25
Nice people for the most part. Management is evil.,"Most of the workers I met there were super friendly and helpful. However management tactics were very deceitful and it was often run like a high school popularity contest. If they liked you they would promote you regardless of work ethic or tenure. If they were allowed to take advantage of you they would then strong arm you into doing things you shouldn't. Also not against lying to you to get you into a different position and if you disagreed they would just say ""do you want the job or not"".",1,Former Employee,Associate ,"Colorado Springs, CO",7/25/22,2022,7,25

Sucks,"Management was terrible, the lead was never ever there 95% of the time. Favoritism was bad there, they’d take off points for some people but not everyone. They fire you even if you have a doctors note and call in. A million other things, I could go on and on . ",1,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Saginaw, TX",7/25/22,2022,7,25
Very stressful and depressing work environment ,Depending on the team leads or managers it will make your day fun or enjoyable or depressed most of the time. They demand to much of their employees while the certain team leads are lazy and don't work. But if you do your job you won't get into trouble.

Also very inconsistent lunch time",3,Current Employee,Cap Team 2 Associate ,Washington State,7/25/22,2022,7,25
Worst 2 years spent in this company,I found that working here was fun then after a few months I found my self a 16 year old clearing a whole parking lot by myself. I was told that I was not allowed to go home unless the lot was cleared. During this time I was in school and they were pushing me past my hours and it started to effect my school life. When I moved inside as a cashier it was great then I was put on a register by myself and had to checkout a long line of customers and I would sometimes work till the register told me I couldn’t anymore and I had to go on break. Around Christmas I would be the only one on a register for three hours and would be told that there was no one to replace me and the team leads would leave it at that. I would be left wondering when I would be allowed to leave so I can finish my homework for school. I was moved into online grocery pickup soon enough people took advantage of me as I learned. I would pick up the slack of other and ended up have a heat stroke and almost having another. Many times I have thrown up and I ended up reporting it to the managers. They said they would couch people but never did. I told them I wanted to leave but they kept telling me not to. After I finally moved to apparel I found that they took a whole dollar which I lost over $100 from my paycheck and my team lead told me they were only supposed to take 10%. They were pile also many times a week tell me I was not allowed in apparel and I would be working as a cashier then I would be moved to stocking then I would be moved to online grocery.

Walmart is the worst company ever ,"Where should I start, first of all no interview, they have hours for how long it should take for work to get done and they are completely unrealistic and inaccurate management is bullies, all they do is walk around all night and talk and they don’t help the team at all, they don’t appreciate anything there workers do for them, and they will stab you right in the back with no problem, moral of the story Walmart may pay good but it is not worth the trouble of dealing with management and working there will just stress you out and your job never feels safe, DONT WORK FOR WALMART ",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stock Associate ,"Reading, PA",7/24/22,2022,7,24
Ok place to work,Walmart always expects you to work. It’s easy to move up if you are friendly and work hard. They are def money driven though and the job can be stressful but other employees are great but they do have a lot of people in and out. I’ve done cashier and stocking and much prefer stocking.

"Ups & Downs, but room for advancement within","One of the positives with Walmart is they like to promote within. Regardless if you're up against a potential out-source hire, Walmart does see the value in the associate who has the hands on experience and time with the company. The hardest part of the job is keeping areas well staffed. When staffing issues trickle down to customer service being impacted, it then becomes your problem.

Miserable place to work,"I work there for almost  4 years, getting Promoting is like a dream, unfortunately, the manager promises to promote but you never get it. Very low pay, always cut hours.

Gain experience in many different aspects,"I did way too much and got way too little hours, even graduated high school early to work full time to prepare for college and they denied me work and lowered my schedule to 4 hours 4 days a week after I had graduated.

Sucked ,"They sucked and so does the management team as well. Not only did they not train me like I deserved but also yell at me 8 times within 2 work days over stuff they told me to do.

Would not recommend ,This job was ok.  The company made it almost impossible to accomplish goals with your mental health intact.  You were always underpaid and short staffed (well before the pandemic) and they had ideas as to how you should be scheduled that was not based on need but based on someone in the home office that had never worked in the actual department before thought it should be.

I loved the constant work we had and the people that worked there. ",4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Bullhead City, AZ",7/24/22,2022,7,24
No Training,"Walmart does not train their employees. They just throw you on the job with maybe 4 hours of someone watching you or you watching them. It's a clickish environment and all team leaders have favorites. The HR Office knows nothing. You go over paperwork and complete some videos online the first day.  Employee input means absolutely nothing. We're all running around in new blue vest that are hot  and stick to you when your already in a hot environment. They don't want you to use a lot of bags but they have recycled them so many times they are almost invisible. They break, tear, and they're all one size. The local Target is paying 4 to 6 dollars more an hour to start. Walmart pays $12. The turn over is so bad I don't even bother to learn names. But that's okay because they are all related to one another and the coaches. I work there because they are the only game in this small community. It's hard to get hired anywhere else when your not related to someone. They give employees a 10 percent discount on some things. This is a multi-billion dollar company that treats employees terrible.",2,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Roanoke, AL",7/24/22,2022,7,24
Great job if you're allergic to consistency,"With the pay rate I received, and the work that was typically advertised/expected, it can be a pretty good joint. Unfortunately due to several factors that are not possibly in your control, something WILL go wrong and you'll be left in the water. Rules WILL change mid-shift and require a whole new MO. Management's responsibility and power WILL be juggled around, and you WILL be caught in the middle. Worst part is that if pace is ever shaken due to the unnecessarily shakiness of the very fabric of the job then you the employee will be held to shame. Not to mention favoritism. In all honesty, there are several small details worth mentioning that I shall withhold for brevity sake.If you feel as if you are able to roll with the punches then the job does have highlights. But if you value consistency, honesty, and transparency, then this job is precisely the opposite of what you desire.",2,Current Employee,OPD/OGP department personnel for Walmart Neighborhood Market ,"Mooresville, NC",7/24/22,2022,7,24

A solid first job,"My managers were a bit harsh but they always got us on schedule. The best part was meeting new friends.

I didn't hate it, I learned some things I probably wouldn't have learned elsewhere!",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Kinston, NC",7/23/22,2022,7,23
Decent workplace that needs a lot of improvement ,"I have been here for 3 and a half years and my favorite part of my job is the people who I work with. During my time here I have witnessed a lot of changes. Some better and most, for the worst. Walmart needs to pay their lower level associates like carts pushers and cashiers more if they expect them to stay. Most of the time when i have to stay late and close the store, i get very overwhelmed because i have to peform 3 other peoples job instead of the one that i signed up for with little care from store managment. All because they dont hire and pay them enough. I feel like this company as a whole is slowly going down hill. And If they want people to enjoy their job more, they got to focus on their associates. Instead of profits.",2,Current Employee,Team lead  ,"Cadillac, MI",7/23/22,2022,7,23
Past Experiences,"Overall, the company pays well (with incentives) and allows choice variation in the different sections of the warehouse.

Corporate Diversity,"Walmart overall is more diverse at the store level. However, in Corporate, there is opportunities for more diversity. Often times, people naturally gravitate towards people who they can relate to & then they build a rapport. Professional relationships are built & now they are on a fast track for a promotion. Minorities are often overlooked due to this. I would encourage Walmart to review their ratio of minorities on all levels within each division.

"It’s alright I guess, for the money","They go by their numbers, which don’t always make sense (7-8 skids expected to be worked in 6 hours) the pay is alright if you do overnight, but management likes to play games and pick favorites.",4,Current Employee,Stocker ,"Mechanicsburg, PA",7/23/22,2022,7,23
Not enough pay,Was there over a year never got a raise the management there only picks favorites. It’s terrible hours they expect you to finish multiple pallets full of product in the span of 8 hours all by yourself. Not to mention you only get a petty 10% discount that doesn’t even include groceries. Terrible place to work ,1,Former Employee,Stocker  ,"Dayton, TN",7/23/22,2022,7,23
Nice Hours,Worked for Walmart for 4 years and I can say the pay is never enough for what you can deal with. The hours can be nice for reliable full time work and you can have a nice work life balance.

Overall a great job,"Idk about anywhere else in the company, but for a driver it's a pretty great gig. I hauled primarily from a grocery d.c.  Kept thier equipment in top notch condition.

"Always busy, have to be a fast learner","Always work to be done, whether in your department or anothers. Management can be difficult depending on what location you are at. In my case, I felt like I was talked down to and didn't feel appreciated for the demanding work that I did. Such as, staying overtime to do more picks, not having help due to the many call outs, and sometimes having to take a late break or lunch. I was a personal shopper, so you are timed when picking groceries and you may get a lot of cars to deliver to at one time, and be by yourself. Hopefully the location is not understaffed and you have help. ",3,Former Employee,Walmart personal shopper ,"Archdale, NC",7/22/22,2022,7,22
Not the best,"Worked in apparel/clothing. Training was not provided, they expected you to know what to do. Of course it’s folding clothes and being organized but they don’t show any specifics of folding clothes or organizing racks until you attempt to do it and they come back to tell you something differently, when teamleads should’ve  communicated in the first place. We were not encouraged communications with other workers we had to be completely on our own, they have said themselves they don’t look for team work but the individual pace of everyone, which isn’t right when they barley provide decent training. ",1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Mount Pleasant, MI",7/22/22,2022,7,22
decent bonus structure,Very toxic company to work for. Upper management micromanages everything you do. They work you 6 days a week for long periods of time and never give you the days back. If you take a vacation they are calling you or texting from the store. The morale is very low and they cant seem to replace the managers that quit,1,Current Employee,Co-Manager ,"Tucson, AZ",7/22/22,2022,7,22
co workers where nice and fun to be around ,the night would start off with a 10-15 min meeting then sometime help the previous shift pull pallets for 1-2 hours so we could work them and then there's a lot of pressure from management throughout the night and we would have to do cart round up because no one would do that so there is very little time to finish freight but management still blames us,2,Former Employee,Stock Team Memeber ,New Jersey,7/22/22,2022,7,22
Overall ok," Pay is horrible. Overall raises are standard for any Fortune 500 company. 10+ years ago, it was either who you knew, or who you had a relationship with for advancement in company.

Multiple shifts ,I would not recommend anyone to apply for a job at Walmart. They don't care about anybody but themselves. The only way to ya promotion is by knowing somebody in management.

They mistreat there associates constantly, they have no respect for employees no matter the amount years you have worked for them. They don't bother to properly train you and throw you out on the floor expecting you to learn on your own all it leads to is alot of mistakes and stress. They feel everyone is expendable other than a very few decent managers who respect there employees, most don't even know how to do there job properly or how to treat people. There it is not about talent and work ethics it is about who you know, I have seen many good managers loose there job or walk out the door in a couple of months, while the ones that last are the ones who don't work or know how to treat there employees. Most good managers don't last a few months which says alot about the work environment. Alot of good employees lost there jobs for stupid reasons, while you have people who don't work and throw there jobs on others last years and get away with doing nothing. Very unfair place to work and very short handed most days you have 1 associate running three departments. Alot of departments very shorthanded they don't know how to properly schedule people. The point system has issues, I have heard alot of complaints about people having points they shouldn't, or ones who say they thought were covered by there ppto and they still got a point. There are alot of different issues with the company and it's only going to get worse if they continue on the direction they are going, they forget there associates are necessary - more...",1,Former Employee,"Garden Center Associate, Hardlines, Ogp associate ","Garden center, hardlines, online pickup",7/22/22,2022,7,22

"Horrible Management, Great coworkers","The management is awful. I worked here from December 2019- July 2022. I worked in CAP2 (stocking and unloading trucks) for 2.5 years and it was mentally draining. The work itself wasn't bad at all. But management had you on a time limit and if you didn't get it done in time, it made you stress out. At one point, we had to ask to go to the bathrooms. Management was so awful I had multiple nervous/mental breakdowns a week. I had to bother them for a year and a half to get out of that department. When they finally stopped making up excuses as to why they couldn't move me, I was only in my new department for 2 months before my team lead went and whined to management about me washing the smelly, sweaty, mildewy vests we wore for dispensing grocery orders and got me fired. Even though we had asked him for weeks to wash the vests himself and he said he didn't have time because he was ""too busy with his own laundry"". The whole store now strongly dislikes him. Walmart does not care about you or your well being. The coworkers you have are amazing people. That's the only reason I stayed. The management is terrible.

Not a bad place to work,Management is terrible at times but your team around you will help you feel less stressed. I got a raise twice while I worked there. I was only there for less than a year.

"Toxic work place, bad management.","Store #1010 is a bad place to work. Toxic work environment. The team leads and coaches are all family or grew up around each other. The only way to get promoted is to be part of ""The click"". Constant threats of being held accountable even if you are a hard worker. They switch from not allowing over time to basically mandating it during certain times of the year by putting 15 or more hours of work on you in a night and holding a coaching over your head if your not willing to work over and finish.

Not the worst- deli department ,"Co-workers were awesome and never had an issue with managers. Training was good and it was great to be in a area not effected by holiday craziness. Small raise available each year during your review. You could also put in a request for the days off you would like that week since you were supposed to get two. They would have cook out days and sometimes doughnuts and lunch meat in the break room. You were required to take your breaks and lunch on time. Only downside was you will never get full time hours since, at least when I was there, only the manager and assistant manager in each department is full time. I would typically work 4 or 6 hour shifts. However deli paid a bit more due to the equipment. ",4,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Mattoon, IL",7/21/22,2022,7,21

Stable job and self managing ,"Overall its a very good job, if you do your job. Management leaves you alone and are quite friendly if you get your work done or at least actually try, they see it and will work with you. Schedules are usually flexible with your needs.

Lacking,"Although Walmart prides itself on being inclusive and claiming they put their teams first, they do not. At least in my location. Others stores may be different but all of the ones in my district have some of the most toxic management I've ever seen. They will continually raise standards but refuse to compensate with extra pay or even extra help by hiring more for the higher workload. The turnover rate is really high at most stores due to the mistreatment from management.",3,Current Employee,Digital Personal Shopper ,"Rockwood, TN",7/20/22,2022,7,20

Employe Retention is Least of Their Concerns for Cheaper Labor,"Working at Walmart can be hit or miss, heavily dependant on your Management. What is constant is the lack of care towards maintaining employees, thus having lower quality labor with increasing freight. Currently full time associates are having hours cut back despite being on a team schedule (consistent schedule for full time only) while also hiring so many new employees without proper training and work. Veteran associates barely get anything recognition and availability/time off requests generally get ignored. For a corporation that has had record profits due to covid, they fail to allocate that towards their employee's health. Taking covid leave is no longer paid for and just considered normal medical leave, yet making you jump through hoops through their own claim filing (sedgwick). ",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,Mississippi,7/20/22,2022,7,20

Poor training. Poor equipment. All management works against each other. ,Transfered twice. All the same. Cut hours at a moments notice. Once a year across the board 2.5% raise.

Walmart,"Overall, a great place to work. Wonderful benefits, flexible scheduling, and there are always opportunities for advancements. The only downside is the pay is not quite what you'd expect working for a company that brings in $1,531,920,547 per day in revenue. A typical workday depends on the department you work in.

Toxic workplace with nothing to do half the time,"Worked as a personal shopper for around 6 months. Started out as a favorite among management, hard worker and good at my job. However, as I began to take time off to try to deal with some medical issues, it quickly turned sour. Management is hardly ever there and are always in the break room or HR office chatting and messing around. The entire place absolutely REEKS of favoritism and they’re very quick to turn. Was I an awesome employee? No, especially as my health took a downturn. Did I deserve to be berated until I cried while injured and asking to leave for the day? Absolutely not. Other than that, there was nothing to do half the shift. Orders would flood in in the morning from about 5-8 and by 9 we were pretty done for the day. You had people fighting to be able to take orders because it was something to do. We were told to do top stock but you could hardly ever find steps to grab stuff and actually do top stock—they were all taken by people whose actual job it was to do top stock. Incredibly infuriating, especially since they wouldn’t let you go home. Just a really terrible job, honestly. I would recommend no one work here.

Team associates are expected to do the managing teams work without proper compensation. I do not recommend working here unless it’s part time. Your time will be taken advantage of and you are not treated like a person if you have concerns about your job or an issue with another associate. Management is an absolute joke and don’t really care about being flexible with your schedule.

",2,Former Employee,Pharmacy Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Plano, TX",7/19/22,2022,7,19
Management ,"The managers at my old store did not care about anything. They did not have a caring bone in their body especially for the elderly. Sure it’s nice making 15-20 dollars an hour without college education but it’s not worth the hassle. No work life balance. And if you do go home in the middle of a work day it’s counted against you. “See hear something say something” is not actually a thing at Walmart. The managers do not care about any employee conflict or scheduling issues. As long as you show up and do 1% of your job, you’re good to go. I was fired due to attendance. So they say. I accidentally put in the wrong pto time twice and asked for help for 2 weeks to fix it. And instead of helping me fix the time with the pto hours I had I was fired. And did not get my $400 pto payout. I was fired because I stuck up for myself and had a backbone. You cannot have a backbone working at Walmart otherwise you’re seen as a threat. And then you get fired. Poor poor management and store director. ",1,Former Employee,Fresh Production Associate ,"Greenville, MI",7/19/22,2022,7,19

"Unfair pair for Fresh Associates. Great people, but management never gets anything done.","The work environment is truly great at my location. The managers are all super cool and so are the workers. Working in a neighborhood market is great because everyone has a good relationship with each other. However, the management will not get anything done for you. If you have a request whether it comes to a schedule request, time off request, or even trying to change positions, it most likely will not happen. In my personal experience I have asked every manager in the store for the past 2 months for a schedule adjustment and still nothing has changed. Information does not get passed along between managers. If you have a request, you need to go straight to the store manager to even have a chance of it happening. The managers will also play favorites to the people they have personal connections with. For example, I have been requesting a morning position for a few months now, and when one finally opens up, the managers favorite hops in and gets it without even asking for it. I’ve even gotten to the point of asking them to cut my hours so I’m not working so late and they still haven’t made any changes. Not to mention I am in the most unfairly paid department in the store. Fresh. In fresh you have to maintain every fresh area in the store at once, with maybe one other associate in your department if you’re lucky. This includes meat, produce, dairy, and frozen.Not only do you have to maintain them and keep them looking nice, you will have about 3-6 pallets in each area besides meat that you have to work throughout your shift to “give the night crew a head start”.

"Pretty fun and easy place to work at, but sometimes lack of associates hurts",I've worked at this Walmart for almost 3 years. I have never had any complaints about the place rather than the stereotype of Walmarts having little to no associates on registers. The associates I worked with and the management I've dealt with treated me like family since day 1. Never in my life have I not felt like I belonged. Management is on top of things and have their associates backs and enforce their policies in a fair manner.

Easy work but can become overwhelming,The job was not too hard but it became overwhelming and I just couldn’t do it anymore. Really flexible scheduling.

"Shorthanded, accountability non existent ","I worked overnight. Product on shelf is all that matters. Every manager is on a different page. No consistency, no accountability.

It started out okay but got worse with time,"I started working at Walmart when I was 19 and stayed with them for 13 years, only leaving when I moved out of state. It wasn't so much loyalty to the store that kept me, but the fact that I couldn't find anything better paying. I honestly never should have stayed for as long as I did. My coworkers were fine for the most part, but after being there so long, you always tend to get people coming and going, so more obnoxious people tend to take their place. Management never knows how to run anything and I heard after I left they got super strict on the call outs. The worst thing about working their for so long is that most new employees would get hired making the same amount of money as me starting that I had to work up to.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Clermont, FL",7/18/22,2022,7,18
Is it really worth it? ,"Greedy corporation all about the almighty dollar. 90% of management is comprised of incompetent a**-kissers that treat their employees like garbage. Need time off of work for being sick? You’ll lose your job. They “favor” new employees just in off the street with 0 experience while veteran employees pick up the slack and do triple the work. They tell you one thing one day then turn around and do something else, it all depends on who you are. They’ll continue to utilize people like me though to reap the benefits and get a pat on the back. Oh, and safety regulations get thrown out the window. Have had to work during a power outage and multiple people have gotten injured on the job due to faulty areas not being fixed.

Hard and frustrating at times but one of the best places to work,The work is harder than people expect. When it comes to order fillers we have alot of new people either quit or move to another job. New management doesn't make it easier. I only know how it is for the weekend shift. It is terribly stressful at times. It seem they care more about production than you. So is life.

Long story at Walmart Neighborhood Market.,"It was fun and good time at first after being hired in the Summer of 2021. I was able to learn new things and mechanisms related to cashiering with help from other co-workers with ease. I would make a couple of mistakes, some ugly along the way but our Cashier Team Lead guy (which i see as the most supportive manager towards it's employees for a specific department.) would often show mercy and forgive me or others for it and I wont forget that. However as time went on, so did managements go and go. The most neutral management we had at the Neighborhood market got replaced with most toxic ones I never imagined who simply don't value your life or work. The AP guy and ""witness"" would begin to punish some people including me over violations of small ""walmart policies"" never seen in what they call ULearns for training from months ago out of nowhere, derailing chances of promotions because our AP guy is so desperate for promotions or free cakes.In some cases I would hear from other co-workers how their current schedules would get changed randomly out of nowhere by new ""People's Lead"" which some decided to put their 2 week leave notice for good, which I don't blame them. (I mean why would you secretly change their schedules WITHOUT their approval?)Overall from a guy who has worked at the same location for over a year. I don't recommend working there, I mean they are ""urgently"" hiring so if you need a quick buck then go for it but I advise against working there long-term!!",2,Former Employee,Walmart Cashier ,"Bellevue, WA",7/17/22,2022,7,17
Boring and underpaid ,"When you're a cashier, you only have 1 square foot of a place you can stand in. I was a cashier and they would have me stock produce, and they get paid $2 more than the cashiers. I asked for a raise since I was doing harder work than what a cashier does, and nobody would let me have the extra pay. ",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Springfield, MO",7/17/22,2022,7,17

Good place to work if you're looking for a very simple job where no one gives a shyt and you aren't worried about making big money,"It was an okay job. Wouldn't have stayed as long as I did if I hadn't met some cool employees. The managers definitely did not entice me, in fact the poor management is kinda what drove me away in the end. There are some good things, like the convenience of the Walmart app and being able to bullshyt around without really being held accountable, that's nice. But It's such a weird vibe in that place, it's like everyone puts on this front like they seriously care about Walmart and doing things the way they should be done, but in reality NO ONE GIVES A SHYT. And since no one else cared, why the helllll would I care? So all in all if you're just out of high school or either 5 years away from retirement, this is a decent job.

Toxic customers and management ,Store manager is always upset about something never is happy.

Okay place to work,Pays good.  But you have one person that gives you direction on what to do in the morning but other teams leads from other departments to pull you on other jobs that don't let you complete the first job you are on.  Very discouraging and disappointing place to be. I guess as the saying goes. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Too many people telling you what to do.

 Good Starter Job,Your typical day of work is easy task that anyone can perform. Many of the days we were understaffed and have to cover other people work area. Management will keep an eye on you at all times and tell you to go faster. The hardest part about the job is removing the packages off the truck because it gets very hot. The most enjoyable part of the job is zoning the areas. I've learned how to properly read a barcode and match it to price tag.

Chasing the money,"I worked for Walmart for 14 years.  I continued to get promoted and I made a lot of money.  Giving up my life was a requirement and a mistake on my part!

Bad Management,"Several team leads left because of the Digital Coach who was not a nice person who belittled their workers and showed no appreciation for hard work put in. I actually loved my job but definitely not the management. While some were very rude, others of those in management roles were extremely inappropriate and could say whatever they wanted to whoever they wanted and no one would do anything about it.

Overall not a good long term job,"I loved Walmart when I first started with it being my first real job and all. Loved the sense of accomplishment when you get everything done. There is a lot of leniency with most things. With that being said, if you are a hard working person, they will work you like a dog. If you work hard they will expect it 100 percent of the time and be upset when you don't. The store managers tend to give out false promises to keep their employees content such as saying you'll get a promotion and handing it to the next person. The benefits are okay but if you want to take pride in what you're doing or make good money, Walmart isn't the place. Been here 3 years and can't wait to get out.

Good place to work potential to grow not guaranteed ,I worked for a year at Walmart started overnight and went to day I met a lot of good workers and managers however I also met alot of no good workers and managers who because of seniority weren’t disciplined or ever reprimanded for there actions and it’s a common thing I also noticed if you wanna move up in the company you have to know someone’s or really stick your head out to be noticed however that doesn’t guarantee anything someone can easily be chosen over you based on there time there or who they know it’s also not a fact but it doesn’t seem to happen often that managers will try to force you out of your position or even out of the company however there is ways around that because it’s a big company you simple just have to make ethics reports and they do act on them ,4,Former Employee,Service Technician ,"Broomfield, CO",7/15/22,2022,7,15

"Every Store, every manager is different (good and bad)","Overall, the whole moral of Walmart is great. Most people get a negative impression of Walmart because of the management. Often managers are almost forced by home office to meet deadlines with employees regardless of the number of people at work or what's going on. This often leads to them pulling an employee from their area to work another area (ie a cashier being pulled to work freight or go to deli). For the employees this often leads to burnout and dissatisfaction. Most people want predictability out of a job and Walmart is not that. I have experienced many sides of this company and I can say it all comes down to the numbers. If sales are high and shrink is low, but attendance is low, they will not see the point in having extra employees for backup if a store is effectively functioning with what it has. So expect to be pushed out of comfort zone and out of your area often! I would like to add a positive. IF a store is ran correctly and is has more discretion when hiring and promoting employees, you will enjoy it. But of course this begins with the store's manager setting the tone for the store and have people on their team adhering to it.",4,Current Employee,Accounting Clerk ,"Baton Rouge, LA",7/15/22,2022,7,15
Company is poorly ran,Management is openly hostile against associates. If something is not to management’s liking they will retaliate against that person.

Would not recommend working here.,1,Former Employee,Associate  ,"Cincinnati, OH",7/15/22,2022,7,15
Disorganized and irritating ,"I was drawn to the job because of the pay rate, but since working there I realize that the pay is not proportionate to the work. You’re on your feet eight  hours is day and do we get two 15 minute breaks, if you do not fight for these breaks, it is possible that you may not get any aside from lunch as there is so much work to do and so few workers you are often overwhelmed. There are often unrealistic expectations set by the management, and the workers have to work extra hard to get these done often rushing or staying over time to complete tasks that were not done during the day. Not to mention that the management are difficult to get a hold of in general and often I felt like they did not listen when I spoke to them. Additionally, this is a very learn as you go job. There was no one there to explain to me what I had to do it was more of a watch and copy kind of job.",2,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"East Stroudsburg, PA",7/15/22,2022,7,15

Could be a great company,The work wasn't hard. I liked the job pay was decent but could be better but management needs to be looked into at this location.

"Lots of drama, favoritism, and not enough people scheduled","There was always a lack of workers being scheduled during my time there and some of the managers favored certain people over others even knowing that those people were treating others fairly and would even back them up on it. The amount of drama at the front just wasn't worth the pay, which was way less than what it is now. I still would say it isn't worth it from what I hear from current employees. Just always understaffed even though they're always hiring, it was like pulling teeth asking for time off, management let a lot of stuff slide which made their workers feel undervalued in comes cases.

It's a job,The wage isn't too bad there are certain parts such as access to the even account and the ability to get part of your paycheck early however favoritism is extremely bad and if you're not one of their favorite employees or have certain types of disabilities that legally protect you you get blamed for absolutely everything that goes wrong!

"Pays good, work is sometimes prolonged","As a whole it is a good company to work for especially if you like to be paid decent. My problem is that it is a already a very physically demanding job and it is sometimes prolonged unnecessarily. When I first started the job, we were working 12 hours shifts 4 days out the week and now that they hired more people is has dropped to 8-10 hours a day, which is fine with me but the manager will purposely stop fast workers from working so that a short day turns into a long day.

Management is horrible , when they are changed from team leads to a coach’s they are very messy and petty and want people to kiss up to them. It’s not fair for the people who work very hard and have to pick up the slack for the rest of the team to be disliked by everyone because of the ones the coaches and team leads favor. It makes no sense for a team lead to tell someone I know after they quit to take me with them like what kind of leader are you. They ain’t nothing But a bunch of followers coming to work to make friends and not work. Walmart is wrong in ever way when they hire someone they do not do a background check on them to later find out they are crazy you have to get hurt at work to be drug tested and the customers at Walmart parking lot almost hit my car five times with a bucket. They pay may seem good but the work they have you do is not worth it and having someone scream at you like you are a wild animal or pet is not what it’s crack up to be,2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper ,"Lake Charles, LA",7/14/22,2022,7,14

Even though you’re expected to make X amount of cakes in a certain period of time and complete any orders you’re also forced to stock, bag bread, slice bread and the list goes on. I could never keep up especially when I was the sole decorator because everyone they hired couldn’t even write on a cake. They expected so much but gave so little.

There were training and computer modules to do most of the time before being thrown out on the floor. I understand learning hands-on so I didn't have an issue with that but hours were changed without warning and most of my coworkers were pot heads that probably needed money for weed.

That being said, I worked there in college and was quickly promoted into a higher paying position.

Worst place to work ever,"This company does not care about its employees. They only view you as a number, not a person. They do not care about your personal struggles, your health, your well-being or your opinions or feedback. They will use you for all you are worth and refuse to pay you fairly.

Productive and good place to meet new people,"Work was okay sometimes fast paced and sometimes super boring, management was laid back but there was definitely favoritism.

"Good Management, Easy, but Low Paying","Nearly everything I am asked to do are easy tasks which gave me lots of time to think about things. Of course with the job being accessible skill-wise you should expect lower pay, while this may be a lower paying job then others in the area, I didn't need more money so I was happy with my wage. With this location being understaffed you frequently have the option to work overtime if you are looking to get a little more money, in addition management may sometimes ask you to work faster. My policy is: Since I am being paid the normal amount I work at normal speed, so I shrug off their occasional request. Again with their location being understaffed I frequently found my department isn't getting everything done, so I remind myself that I don't have time to do everything so I just concern myself with doing what I can do while working at normal speed. My managers were legitimately good they worked, were concerned with getting stuff done, and they weren't toxic.",4,Former Employee,Fresh Cap 2 Associate ,"2003 E Rodeo Dr, Cottonwood, AZ 86326",7/12/22,2022,7,12

Good if you don't have options,"Walmart is a great employer for people in areas or stages of life without plentiful options. They are usually the highest paying entry level employer in an area. But it's important to remember that they are a massive corporation and that you are an individual. Occasionally it's easy to feel like a very small and unimportant piece of a giant machine (it's because you are). That being said, I worked there in college and was quickly promoted into a higher paying position. Plenty of financial incentives that you should ABSOLUTELY take advantage of (stock purchase program, 401k with matching, quarterly bonuses). If you can just clock in and clock out to earn a paycheck, then go for it!",4,Former Employee,Cap 2 Supervisor ,"Bozeman, MT",7/12/22,2022,7,12

Lack of respect for employees private lives,"They change your schedule without warning and take days off away the day before they happen, it doesn’t matter what plans you have or how long you’ve been scheduled that day off.

They sadly have taken a turn for the worse. Been there since 2001,To start out it's great. Especially if you live near one. Co workers are friendly. Night shift gets to work in groups instead of dedicated teams. I learned all my stocking skills from Walmart. Management was helpful. Hardest part was not being able to get a product for a customer because we were out. Enjoyable part was actually finding one for another customer ,2,Former Employee,Frozen Food Clerk ,"Sterling Heights, MI",7/12/22,2022,7,12

Not the best place to work,"Management doesn't care if your sick or a family member is sick, they point you for missing time even if you used PTO.

Fast-paced and stressful at OGP,"I could write a whole book about Walmart OGP.For one, they do not pay enough for the work that they want.The job itself is simple.. in theory, howeverthe actual process of doing the job is a lot more complicated, especially with store management, or worse, district management shows up - everything HAS to be perfect and fast paced (as if it was never before)Some management likes you and you can get promoted relatively easily. I however, declined the offer as it seems more stressful only for a $3 increase per hour.  I've been with the company for 6 months and I still have not gotten my discount card, though that may change soon. I would not recommend working for Walmart unless you are desperate and or seek physical activity. They had me do 11-8 shifts and about 20K steps A DAYNot to mention a lot of other things..Bottom line, don't work for OGP unless there is better pay, and a much simpler and easier way to do you job without hurting your feet.

Worst company to work for ,"Working for Walmart or any company, the managers are suppose to fight FOR their associates, not against them and that is what it is in this store. You are suppose to be able to go to the mangers with a problem or a concern about other mangers/employees or anything and not feel judged or scared of retaliation but yet they do just that. They are real good to gaslight you and make you feel like the problem and tell you that you are complaining. Or tell you they will do something but never do and instead talk about/ poke fun of the conversation you had that is suppose to be CONFIDENTIAL with other managers and store associates on the floor.  They always say keep your personal life and work life separate yet you will have associates and MANAGERS talk about your personal life amongst each other and spread rumors. It’s literately like high school because of how bad the drama is. Favoritism is real in this workplace and they are not afraid to show it. They are real good of pushing away the hard working/loyal associates for the lazy non harding working associates. Mangers never appreciate any hard work but instead will yell at you for a simple little mistake. It’s sad to see what use to be such a fun place to work at turn into something so miserable. Employees never smile or have any desire to help customers anymore. Why? Because of the people running the store. Corporate doesn’t do anything either. Especially when you have corrupt mangers covering stuff up. Also, Walmart preaches about flexibility with schedules yet if you are going to school or a parent, and have to have certain hours - more...",1,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Borger, TX",7/12/22,2022,7,12

It’s Walmart,"Should be the easiest job ever but management makes it seem like rocket science. Management is a constant let down. They are lazy and incompetent. There is no room for growth. Expectations are surprisingly high. However, this is only so that management can get huge bonuses while hourly workers get nothing for meeting certain quotas. They got rid of hourly associate bonuses in order to raise the pay rates when it is more than obvious they could afford both. During this change management got a bigger salary and increased bonuses. Terrible company with terrible management. I worked here for many years and that is only because they were somewhat flexible with my schedule while I went to school. That is the only reason why.

Worst job I have ever had.,There is a lack of cultural and leadership at Walmart . The people are amazing and work really hard but there is no leadership coming from the very top downward. Morale is low and at times depressing. They cut labor so tight that you are basically doing the job all by yourself with barley any help or understanding. They do not value people but only profit. There is a huge disconnect between Walmart leadership and the people that work so hard to run the business.

My take,"The company itself cares about the employees, there are many great things a walmart associate can partake in. Stocks, Healthcare, 401k, cell phone discount, schooling. However the management within the kennewick walmart is very hypocritical, play favoritism, hold extremely high standards for some and let the majority skate by on less than minimal work with no repercussions. The management also cares more about promoting themselves rather than bringing their team up with them. ",3,Former Employee,Member ,"Kennewick, WA",7/11/22,2022,7,11
Get 40 hours pay is fair.,Too many chiefs not enough indians. Have to do the work of 3 people get the pay of one. No more bonuses or weekends off. Only the chiefs get weekends. No longer have any incentive to work harder.,2,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"South Point, OH",7/11/22,2022,7,11

Great Place to Work ,"I throughly enjoyed my time working for walmart distribution. They are 12 hour shifts, but starting pay for some positions is $19 an hour.

Great work place! Would work there again!,"I worked at Walmart for three years. I was in the electronics department most of the time but would help in other departments as well. There was always something to do in my department whether it be stocking, cleaning, or providing customer service. Working at Walmart made time go by fast which I really enjoyed.

Very easy job and decent pay,"You didn't really have much work to do and you could chill when there was no work.

Expect more from you than they should,"Walmart is a place where the managers cut corners in places that screw you over. They dont care about you, they only care about numbers. To them youre just a means to an end. You do all the work so they get all the credit. My store ogp departments freezer has had no lights for almost 2 weeks and instead of getting the lights replaced they just threw some lamps and leds in there and called it good. Its a huge hazard as the freezer leaks water and that water freezes so it makes it slippery. Darkness and icey floor are an accident waiting to happen. How do they get away with not replacing it?

Poor management ,Employees are treated unfairly by management. Drama is very high throughout the entire store/departments. If you are part time there is no security for hours. They will give you 0 hours a week and not bat an eye. I wouldn’t recommend working for Walmart unless you’re fine with being treated poorly and being overworked while someone who sits and does nothing gets all the praise for your work. If they don’t like you they will simply try to bully you out of a job or find any reason to get you coached 3 times in order to be able to fire you.

"Stable employment, but poor management and strategic vision","The company offers comparable compensation to other positions of the same caliber.   While adept at demonstrating forward-thinking strategies for value-added services, upper management cannot seem to relate to the ability to execute them at the store level.  As the business pivots, existing strategies become ineffective, resulting in more confusion than necessary.  The result is poor outcomes for both customers and staff.

Good place to work ,My experience with Walmart was overall a good one. The only thing I didn’t really like was there was no paid holidays if a holiday fell on your scheduled work day then you worked and it was just straight time not time and a half.

will always have a job,the work is stable and Normally the people you work with are nice and easy to get along with. full time you get 2 10min paid breaks and 1 unpaid hour lunch. higher management tends to focused on one or two areas and forget the rest so your team lead is usually fighting to keep member in your area to do work and not be pulled to another area. its a lot of heavy lifting but relatively easy job to do. their is always work so you never have to worry about being let go even during the pandemic. If your looking for a job that pays you the work your doing and will always be their this is a good place to work. if your looking for a well organized work place were you know exactly were every thing is and upper management helps then this is not the job to have.,4,Former Employee,Produce Stocker ,"Effingham, IL",7/9/22,2022,7,9

Overworked,"While I enjoyed the *title* job itself along with the coworkers, it was everything else that definitely wasn't worth it.Just to start, the starting pay for my location was $15/an hour. While this is above minimum wage for my state, I personally don't think it was worth it for how much work was put in. While I was hired under OGP (Online Grocery Pickup), they had us helping out other people in the store along with them helping us when we needed it however we were always understaffed and someone always needed help from another department. The description of the position did mention that we would be required to help out from time to time however this was happening multiple times a day, every single day.Second, I had applied for a full-time position, was given a part-time position only to find out 2-3 weeks later that they hired someone full time but for nearly the same days and times I was, while I was still looking for full time work.Third, my location was a neighborhood market and OGP orders were stored in the back as we were going under construction to move it to the front. When it comes to bringing out orders to cars, they want them out in less than 3 minutes. This didn't change with construction. They still wanted our orders out within 3 minutes. With everything in the way. The aisles were also squished down that two people could barely walk past each other with carts, let alone respecting social distancing for those who are high risk for COVID.Fourth, there are days where I would get over 20k steps in so you're gonna go through a LOT of shoes.

Only Part-timers need apply,"Title says it all. Been here for almost four years and suddenly now it's practically impossible to get anything above 24 hours a week, if you're lucky enough to get even that. It's never a good time to talk to management about getting switched over to full-time status, but even if I could, they're doing the same thing to a coworker who IS full-time. So, it's pointless to even try. That and they REALLY cut corners with their health insurance by going with the cheapest, worst option. Between those problems, how busy it usually is, and how rude a lot of the customers are (not all, but enough for it to annoy you), I can't recommend anyone work here except maybe teenagers in high school who can't find anywhere better.",1,Current Employee,Fresh Cap 2 Associate ,"Amite, LA",7/9/22,2022,7,9

Soul Draining Job,The experience you have working here depends where you work and the most stressful part it’s the incompetent team leads. The Team Lead are never are on the same page.

The manager makes SURE you’re intimidated by him. Second store is & will ALWAYS BE AWFUL! My managers are AWFUL, they don’t give a living, breathing about their employees. They would rather see them fall over from exhaustion than compliment them. I’ve been with two different departments with this walmart, about to go to my 3RD DEPARTMENT, due to the managers being the best on 3rd shift & I won’t have to see the day managers!

A day for Teamleads to Coaches (hourly manager & Salary Managers),"This is very store situational, some stores are better than others and some stores are so understaffed you'd be lucky to catch up. Ill say Wal-Mart as a corporation is great, great benefits, great corporate managers, pay is good for what it is. that being said the stores I am speaking about are 2 stores in MN & WI as I transferred to another store hoping it would get betterAs a Team Lead you are compensated very well, however you're running your areas with little to no help, they do have a stocking team which occasionally gets everything done but they don't have the staff to do it either, this means that while they say ""you don't have to work overtime"" if you want to keep your job you do have to work overtime because Walmart works on a precision process system (which as far as I've seen in retail is one of the best systems I've ever seen), to do your job stocking has to be completed, and if there is 8 hours of stocking in your departments, well, that's your day before you can even think about starting your actual job. For Coaches your job gets significantly easier but you have to work WAY more hours... so if you want to go that route for basically the same pay you could, all your previous duty's are now taken by your 2-4 team leads in your departments, if you're not a lazy manager you'll help your team leads, its in your best interest anyway. I was the Overnight Coach so stocking, maintenance, planograms, etc. were my areas. we were understaffed and many times I worked from 5pm - 11am/12pm the next day because it wasn't my team leads fault things didn't get done and we needed - more...",4,Former Employee,Overnight Operations Manager ,"Sartell, MN & Monona, WI ",7/8/22,2022,7,8

Productive and Fast Paced,"There are lots of lessons to be learned at Walmart. It’s an emotional roller coaster of a job. You will meet people with lots of unique personalities. Sad to say, but most of management is only there for a paycheck. They do not care about your work/life balance. It is impossible to get all the work done and they don’t care to do it by the books. They care only about how their area looks. So even if that means pulling you away from what needs to get done. The benefits are great, however, when it comes to time off there is lots of favoritism.

It was hard to get used to at first, but eventually, you make friends and time goes by faster. But the managers don't seem to care about you unless you are in cahoots or sleeping with them. The amount of times we got picked on by managers was ridiculous just because one of the ""favorites"" didn't like us or mangers would get mad that we didn't do something their way. The hardest part about the job was getting used to moving around so much, and the hours were hard but got bearable towards the end. The most enjoyable part, were the friends I ended up making, a few I went to high school with and didn't talk to much. But then I got ""fired."" I was never sat down or even told I got fired. Also they fired the wrong people, there were more people that didn't do their job but never got fired but if you did your job you'd end up getting fired eventually.  Now I'm not saying this because ALL mangers are like this at other companies besides Walmart, this was my first job, but almost mangers at Walmart just seem like they don't care about us unless we are the ""favorites"" or sleeping with them.

Fun place to work at if you don’t take it to seriously ,Pretty chill as long as you do your job and don’t take advantage of anything.

Each location is different,Prior to applying walk around and listen how associates/ managers talk to each other. Make a list of questions to ask and if you can shadow someone that works in the area you want to work in. Interview your potential manager to see and ask about thier Walmart journey. When I began my career back in 2015 associates had respect for each other no matter what thier title was. 2022 I feel like people have lost the value of treating each other how they want to be treated. I highly recommend visiting the store and just listening to associates talk to get a feel for the store. ,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,California,7/7/22,2022,7,7
Great place to work,A great place to work but when work slows down you will often be left struggling and leaving early almost every day. Job is flexible on hours and some great people to work with. ,3,Current Employee,Warehouse Associate ,"Laurens, SC",7/7/22,2022,7,7

Teamwork? What’s that? ,"They have posters up about teamwork.. all over the back part of the store. In the break room, the back halls.. However we don’t use teamwork. I feel like it’s for every person on their own. Pettiness. Cliques. Upper management is great, they have your back. They hired 20 people In 30 days. They prefer part time without benefits. So if you’re part time, less hours!! I only get 20 hours a week. ",3,Current Employee,Grocery Associate ,"Waterloo, IA",7/7/22,2022,7,7
Triggering work environment,"When I was working in the deli, the environment was off! You rarely saw somebody with a smile working in that place. They train you a little bit.

Don’t make friends! I always worked night shift! I’ll be there all day!

It was just ok.,"It was a decent job, not too demanding. The only problem I really had was that when I went back to school for the fall semester, which I let them know about 2 weeks beforehand and told the right people they told me to tell, they let me go without notice. I went back there when I had an extended break to see if I could pick up some shifts and they told me to reapply. I would have been fine with it if they would have let me know they couldn't just hold the job or take me back, or if there was anything else I needed to do (which I asked about), but they just clean let me go.

I enjoyed working with the people and enjoyed helping all people I had over the years. ,2,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Greensburg, IN",7/6/22,2022,7,6
A lot of... tensity between employees and management ,I worked here temporarily as a summer job... and it was... anxiety-inducing (I was desperate at the time ) Some of the older men well into their fifties would hit on the younger girls ( including me ) and it was just awfully uncomfortable.. or they'd talk about the most grotesque subjects in the break-room. There was often drama and gossip between workers and some management and it just made things awkward once they wanted to push you into the conversation ( I'm just there to make money.. not be involved ) Management was unclear with training which led to some panic attacks.  Probably one of the most disorganized companies I've worked at. Once you step into the employee area you can just feel how tense it is. I had never felt so uncomfortable in an environment as this. ,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,Massachusetts,7/6/22,2022,7,6

There’s also no structured training curriculum for new associates. So we’re expected to train new people ourselves, while we’re extraordinarily busy, and without equipment.

Some managers are understanding, yet sometimes store management can be more focused on numbers and metrics more than their employee's needs and concerns. Oftentimes the new Store Manager seems very transactional in his leadership and will deny request for time off/ availability forms.

The positive and negatives of my personal experience with Walmart ,"Walmart is a great career choice for anyone between the ages of 18-28 years old.Opportunity for growth determines on your choices and will to keep pushing for your desired outcome.In General the company seems to mean well and give you a great deal of options within it's practiced rules.One complaint I often hear the most from entry level associates is that the company has to many rules and policies. These policies are always in motion and are subject to change to the employee's or employers favor given the nature of the subject at hand. If you are planning on staying with Walmart as a career for life one suggestion is to be ready at any given time to relocate as changing stores, warehouses and any general location will give you more opportunities to obtain various career options internally that match your personal preferences efficiently. Being at the top isn't always easy.In most cases you will have to hold your ground andmake sure your superiors know what it is you are trying to obtain.Not giving up and making moves are going to be necessary to climb the ladder. The most unfortunate hurdle that I've experienced and watched co-workers struggle with is not getting what they need,even if years of devotion,loyalty & hard work have been strongly executed on your behalf.I have observed favoritism from higher up managersthat have affected the overall success rate of certain dedicated associates resulting in a change in work habits,hope and general faith in their future.For example an internal associate of 3 years that qualifies for a recently posted job is denied a promotion - more...",3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Tarpon Springs, FL",7/6/22,2022,7,6

Never work here. ,"Don't work here. If you want to be treated like you aren't human, work here. We have rules such as: you can only enter through the Grocery Doors. We aren't supposed to go in or leave through Pharmacy doors, garden center doors, or automotive doors. How quirky is that! Useless rules that make working here awful. Oh, and the lack of communication is insane as well. The front end doesn't supply everyone with walkies. We're supposed to use ""action codes"" which Team Leads never look at. God forbid you're under 21 with alcohol. You better be lucky and hope a teamlead or someone with keys to approve the sale is passing by. Working here is a nightmare.

Good and Bad all depends on what store and manager you're dealing with. ,"I worked as a cashier for two years and two years at OGP. I basically worked for 4 years. I think the OGP position was less tough as being a cashier because when you are a cashier you're not only working with putting reshops back to the floor but also pushing carts and being volunteered to do stockings. In the OGP department I was the dispenser and one of the hardest things I faced was my store did not provide me was enough space for downstacking the 20 online orders that needed to be downstacked hourly. Sometimes the managers aren't careful about how many people they should send to dispense but it turns out we get slammed by so many cars.

"The pay is reasonable for overnight, but work life balance is bad at certain stores. ","Both locations I worked at, I was hired and let them know that I was only available to work certain days overnight because I am a fulltime mom to a disabled child. They both promised they would keep to the availability schedule, but soon after, they would change my days constantly, on days I could not work because I had no one to take care of my child, who isn't able to be accepted in regular daycare. So I had to quit because of all of the occurrence accumulation would lead me to get fired anyway. The college program they have is excellent (a lot of degrees are paid 100% by Walmart) and I am sad that I was not able to stay in order to enroll. I might try again at another location in 6 months because the occurrence balance starts off to 0 again, and I will still be in the system, so it is extremely easy to get rehired, I will say that.

It Was Bittersweet Here,"I enjoyed my job as an automotive tech to the fullest. I liked my little cubby hole and the entire crew I worked with. I did oil changes, battery swaps, tire installations, flat repairs, and certain fluid top-ups. Loved every minute of it! I did service writing from time to time, but I preferred to spend my time in the technician's lair. It was tough getting me out of there to do anything else sometimes. The days went by fast, and we had an entire hour for lunch. Sometimes they bought us pizzas and such. The job had decent benefits once I got to full-time, but getting there was like pulling teeth. The pay was so-so in the beginning and got better, more livable, toward the end. It was a cool gig with minimal serious issues before Covid came. Once Covid hit, things changed. People got force-moved and some didn't want to be on the store side at that time because of the risk. Certain managers were rude and condescending toward the employees helping them in their unfamiliar depts, and THAT made getting force-moved even worse. People started acting a fool in general. It was a very stressful time for everyone, and things never quite got back to the way it was before then. I don't know how it is now because I'm not there. Pre-Covid it was something I would recommend to anyone. I was proud of my little position and not at all embarrassed to work for Walmart. The only gripe I had was that there was no opportunity to advance. That's my honest and unemotional review.",4,Former Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Rincon, GA",7/4/22,2022,7,4
"Productive, fast paced work environment ","Spent two years working here, performed three different roles, a DA order filler, a case-lot order filler, and an unloader.  Amongst the three roles unloading trucks is by far the least physically mandating.  If you're young and in shape case-lot is the place for you.  Simple place pre-printed labels onto freight and place on conveyor belt to be sent to shipping.

Its a good starting job but...,"Managers can be very unfair and demanding. Getting told to do things you're not prepared for, like pushing carts at 90 degrees with black jeans and 2 vests, or missing your lunch because the freezers broke again for the 3rd time this month. The call off system can be very hit or miss, they don't allow for un-paid protected time off call offs on Friday, Saturday, and or Sunday. You either get to do nothing since your manager/team lead makes you do normal amounts of work, which isnt much, or you get told to do everything because different department managers will tell you what to do, and then you dont get your job done in time, and get reprimanded for it. Working with customers isnt the issue, nobody in management cares about you or your problems, youre just a number in the system and they will fire you on the spot if you make them look bad.

Great Pay,"This was the highest paying job i’ve had. The pay was great and you receive raises every 3 months.

"Busy, takes a toll on you, bad management ","Job is okay, not too repetitive. Takes a toll on your body though, with the high focus on CS (which is understandable) they tend to care less for employees. I've seen people in their first week - month, left in charge of whole departments because of penalties if someone is to work over on hours. New system lowered benefits quality. If you're willing to sacrifice you body, self esteem, personal life and time for a paycheck that pays a just okay amount. Go for it.

Worst place I’ve ever worked,Worst management I’ve ever worked for. Completely unorganized chaos that never seems to ever hit any of their goals. I’ve personally experienced & watched managers let employees fail and not help or guide them whatsoever. I’ve also watched management accuse their employees of taking longer than 15 minute breaks when they themselves take 2-3 15min breaks before lunch even hits. Most people who work here are hypocrites and very rude and judgemental people. ,1,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Forest Lake, MN",7/2/22,2022,7,2
Management doesn't seem to have the employee's well-being in mind,"After working there for a year I've found that there are several things that are cons for this company and most of it revolves around the management and their practices. The environment is very ""dog eat dog"" and there is no reward for doing your job well. There is little to no work/life balance, hours are cut in departments to give hours in others. It is typical to have a full-time position and only get 32-39 hours a week. The pay is low for the work that you are required to do and there are no incentive programs to help you develop your skills or make you want to. Getting a ""good job"" is hard to come by.

With COVID and and overall movement of people the workforce seems to always be in flux. This causes a perpetual shortness of staffing. To keep up there is constant hiring events. However, the work load is heavy and with managers being pulled from the work pool without prior training or any form of education about management procedures they copy the back habits of their managers whose training is also sketchy at best. Managers badger, coerce, lie and bully associates, anything to get the work done and it creates a toxic work environment where associates are always looking for something better.",3,Current Employee,Team Lead ,"Hinesville, GA",6/30/22,2022,6,30
Difficult management,Working for Walmart was unpleasant and the manager treated me terribly when I went to him with a simple question about when we got paid. Most people seemed to hate being there.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Midvale, UT",6/30/22,2022,6,30
Overall great..,"I worked in the deli, which was fairly easy. Most of your day consists of prepping foods and making rotisserie chickens. Most customers were nice. Some parts of the job I felt I wasn't trained for so I struggled a bit with some things. I started to feel like I was being walked on because they tried to make me run the entire deli while also running freight by myself whenever coworkers called out rather than trying to find me help. I quit after they changed my schedule from being a closer to coming in at 5am without asking me. ",4,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Lynchburg, VA",6/30/22,2022,6,30
It’s Walmart.,"I mean… it’s Walmart. The pay is awful, the hours and benefits are a joke, my personal management is pretty good but too many people take the dumbest things seriously. As a cashier, I’m not allowed to have anything but water at the register, at all. This is my side job, I’m a Marine by trade. I live off of energy drinks. Even if I’m not drinking it in front of customers management always has something to say and they (try to) make me dump it out, and it’s just a ridiculous rule. Also, my Walmart is in a rural area and most of the customers are some of the rudest people I have ever met, and that’s saying something considering I’m from Chicago.",1,Current Employee,Cashier ,North Carolina,6/30/22,2022,6,30

It's a joke,Worked there for right at two years. My management sucked. We'd have people come in to orientation and not come back. Every higher up associate treated us horribly. I dreaded going to work. My hours would switch constantly. 4hrs one week to 33hrs the next. Best decision I made was quitting. Such a relief to not have to deal with it anymore.

Management does not care about their associates,"Management will watch the hardest working associate get assaulted on numerous occasions and not even file an accident to ensure the associate is okay.  The pay is unfair, someone working for the company for several years should not make over $1.50 less than someone starting out that has ZERO experience.

Easy and good pay but will eat your soul alive,"Easy job and good pay. $20.25 starting off at 1st shift (Monday-Thursday,10 hour shifts, if there is overtime, that day will depend on what your manager gives you when you first start. it’s only 5 days mandatory so that’s a huge bonus unlike other warehouses that make you work 6 days. Managers are decent but some are always checking your rate and down time. there’s also no point of of moving up since the pay does not go up. If you’re a trainer or equipment operator, pay stays the same. The job is very repetitive and will eat your soul alive. Doing the same task all day for 10 hours. Super hot in the warehouse as well. It’s good pay but if you’re willing to deal with boredom and hot weather for a third of your life, apply! Btw, probably the most Bearable warehouse job I’ve had.

Managers were nice but few of them were a bit passive aggressive. As a cashier and a food sales associate, I bumped into my fair share of rude customers. My coworkers were extremely nice which helped me get through the day. I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers.

"Great pay, terrible company policies ",I enjoyed the pay working at Walmart. The actual labor wasn’t bad itself you just need to know what you’re doing. I don’t like that they always expect you to be there 9 hours. You get 2 15 minute breaks & 1 hour lunch . You MUST take the hour lunch . You can’t skip it & go home an hour early which is what I don’t like. I was typically scheduled 6am-3pm or 7am-4pm . Hated 7a-4p ; it will really drain you. There’s a lot of other company policies I don’t agree with as well. Like the demerit system for calling in or being 10 mins late. They expect you to live & breathe Walmart. Takes dedication & determination for sure if you actually want to succeed with them. They do Offer chances to move up in the company . You just have to put in the time & have the qualifications ,3,Former Employee,Deli/Bakery Associate ,"Milwaukee, WI",6/29/22,2022,6,29
Don’t do it.,The good thing is the benefits. The job sucks. You get told so much that is a lie. They want you to do team lead job but no pay or title. A lot of favoritism.

Another company who doesn’t care,"Working at Walmart is not ideal. They do not accept doctor notes for any reason. They do not give you traditional sick days, instead you get protective paid time off (ppto). Your PTO and PPTO are accrued as you work. There is a 3 month trial period before you receive any benefits. It took 2 months after I signed up for health insurance to receive my card. Management doesn’t seem to care if you are hobbling along with a messed up foot. Customers make the job more difficult than it really is. This isn’t a long term job. The pay isn’t good.

I would check which items are low in stock and I stock them. I would put the remaining products on top of the shelves close to where the items are located. I arrange the products on top e staff sure the UPC is faced front. I arrange the items neatly. I communicate with my Lead atall times. I respect my Lead and I enjoy working with him. The hardest part of my job is finding items in the wrong place. I’m responsible to put them back in the right location. It’s the same also when I stock the freezer products.

They offer additional benefits like life insurance, short & long term disability, accident & critical illness benefits offered through Allstate. It doesn't cost much & it's something I wish all companies would offer. You never know when you might need it but if you ever do you will be glad you have it. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?They do tend to rush you too much & they don't give you the proper amount of time to do the job CORRECTLY. It really only forces the workers to rush & half - a@@ do the job which always causes more problems in the long run. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?It's really not a bad place to work as long as you have good managers to work for. Some managers should never be managers! They only get the position because they suck up to higher up managers or they are good buddies or whatever... you probably know what I'm talking about. lol  What is a typical day like for you at the company?Most of the time we are always pretty busy & we work from start to finish & sometimes actually stay over on occasion but only if they approve the overtime or else you will have to either come in a little later or leave a little early one day to make up for it.

The management is horrible,Management is horrible. The place is ran by managers that do not care. The GM is very much so sneaky and makes the facility hostile. They spend several money on third party contractors and unnecessary improvements but can’t fix things that are necessary like pipe leaks. Nobody is allowed to work overtime anymore. They fire the good managers that actually care and are trying to make the company better.

Having a MAJOR identity crisis from within that is HURTING its associates and profits.,"Walmart much like the rest of the companies that made tons of money during covid, has chosen to spend that money on unnecessary store remodels and buying only select employees phones that track you, while also getting rid of the much more efficient and fast handheld computers they had before. All of that and they still want to pay too little to do way more work than your job description would imply. Management was restructured a few years ago and it seems that they still only hire the brown nosers into the higher paying jobs simply because they're good at telling the higher ups what they want to hear instead of trying to improve store conditions to increase productivity/profit. This big corp is trying to put a new coat of paint on a still giant t*rd of a company that pretends like it cares about its associates, but in reality is just trying not to get sued. I really believed when I started that Walmart was the place for me, I was told numerous times that hard work was rewarded, but that just isn't the case.  Lazy unprofessional Managers that should have stayed in high school with the attitudes they brought to work daily. They tend to run off the harder working associates who advocate for better conditions or fairer treatment  (bringing attention to associates who are not working or doing a 10th of the work everyone else is.

Opportunity to grow. Bad management.,"Walmart has many career fields you can go into, so with that being said, there are many growth opportunities. Walmart usually will pay for those opportunities (licensure, college, mileage, etc.). In the vision center, we have the luxury of being lead by one manager (sometimes the Market Director). My manager was more understanding than most and would work with your schedule. The negatives far outweigh the good. Associate discount is not good, if you need something from the store management good luck, the management team is usually disrespectful, policies are put in place, and then not followed by store leaders. They claim to have an open-door policy, where if you have any complaints they will look into it and come to a resolution.

Unprofessional Upper Management,"Worked there for 8 months.  As a non-manager it was as expected.  No real issues.  But once promoted you see the real business.  Unprofessional managers, promoted, but not paid for the time I worked as a manager until I had taken two different training classes which took over 3 months.  No clear guidelines.  Managers and Upper Management (district, division) would threaten assistant managers if they questioned anything about how the manager did things.  Everything was supposed to be done the 'Wal-Mart Way"", but even in the training I heard and saw how managers just did it their own way.  Main office wasn't any better.

Also, being forced out of your job area specifically to cover another that you may or may not be trained in or know absolutely nothing about.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Toxic and dramatic, very sink or swim.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Clock in, deal with whatever returns are there, clean up and zone the sales floor, get stolen to cover x department, or cashier, MAYBE you might get your breaks on time, if at all.

Work could be fun or a nightmare ,"When I worked at Walmart I has experiences with 3 different stores.The first 2 were great. Management was very kind and concerned about issues that might arise.When I got to the 3rd store the store manager was pretty nice and showed concern. Later we got a different store manager and at first she was ok but after I had requested my hours to be earlier due to being a single parent and only seeing my young son to put him on the bus in the morning things changed. I was requested to drop back to a lower paying position and when I refused I had a target on my back. If things happened even on my days off I would get stress for it. I loved my job, but I was coming to hate it.I had medical issues which were getting worse due to the stress I was getting at work. My kids were hating the change in me and I was missing more time due to the medical issues being worse.After I left Walmart my medical issues became more manageable. Some of the meds I was on were lowered and eventually I was even taken off the blood pressure medicine. Overall it was a good and pleasant place to work.  You just sometimes get managers that can be mean. People are just that way.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"Greenville, MI",6/23/22,2022,6,23

"Great environment, not worth the pay. ","I’d like to start with the environment was wonderful. It was very easy to communicate with my leads, as well as other workers, everyone was very friendly. My only issue lies within the incompetent employees hired who don’t do their job, but have yet to be relieved of their duties. I pulled the weight of 5 people, because lead was pulled to other departments constantly & other workers did not carry their own. If one single person is pulling all of the weight, those who aren’t need to be replaced or the employee(s) taking others slack need to be compensated for said employees inconsistency.

A very diverse workplace that will bring out all of your emotions. ,"The good things about working at Walmart are the benefits. Extremely well matched on your 401k etc. Another good thing about Walmart is socialization. If you need to work on your social skills, the customer interaction helps immensely. However there are bad things about Walmart, mostly the people you work with.  Walmart matches you 50/50 on whatever you decide to put towards your 401k, I find that pretty good!! Like most other places, you have a choice on how much out of every paycheck you want to take out towards your retirement plan. It will always be matched the same by the company. You can also change the rate at any time throughout the year!  Working at Walmart you deal with a lot of customers. These customers come in a variety, nice, rude, impatient, you name it you see it. This gives you an opportunity to learn how to deal with these situations and open up in communication skills. The worst thing about this company has to be the coworkers and managers. You will find people who don't like you for no reason including your management teams. Lots of drama is created working at these stores.

Meh,"Worked awhile ago for some years. Seen a lot of things here and there. The job just ain’t what it used to be and ultimately led me to quitting. You can work here as a kid in high school but as you grow older you start to open your eyes and see the place for what it really is. There’s always gonna be cliques. There’s always gonna be drama. And there’s always gonna be bullsh1t. Luckily for me I only threw away a few years of my life and it wasn’t terrible. It just sucks that I wasted so much time here. The people I met here were great (for the most part) but I couldn’t help but feel disrespected by some individuals that shall not be named. I can’t believe I gave up so much for nothing. Don’t go above and beyond but don’t suck either. No one is gonna watch out for you and you’re really just gonna be on your own. Sorry for the rant. I didn’t even know people actually reviewed the work experience here and I wish I knew about this earlier.

Everybody wants to be a manager.,"The thing I liked the most was also the thing I hated most.  Management.  Most days Management was pretty decent.  If you do your job and don't give them too much push back then they are pretty respectful of you and left you alone.  Then there are those who don't care about what your job is, don't care about who asked you to do what, they expect you to drop what you are doing to do whatever they ask of you.  For Example, I was a service technician and we had a schedule we followed with a list of duties we had to complete at opening and closing.  Most of the time management knew this and let us do what we had to before they asked if we could work in other areas of the store.  Then there were some that expected us to drop what we were doing, close the shop EVEN IF A CUSTOMER'S CAR WAS STILL IN SHOP, and go work on the far side of the store because they themselves didn't feel like doing the job.  Most of the time, you could work it out with them.  Other times, you had to remind them that you have a job to do and if you don't, then they are also responsible for the work not getting done.",4,Former Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Chardon, OH",6/22/22,2022,6,22

One of if not the worst place to work,"Miserable job with multiple managers giving you contradicting “goals” and tasks all day, no one knows what’s going on bc they walk through once a day looking for what they need to complain about to hit their checklist.

"Great Co-Workers, Terrible Pay and Conditions","In my experience, I had a great set of co-workers at Walmart. They were friendly and helpful, and there was no drama at my store on my shift between us. I also had a few good managers who tried to accommodate my needs as an autistic person as best they could.However, the company gives workers no heads-up about autism accommodations and several company policies, like the constantly changing schedules and not assigning fixed roles to employees, are not very autism friendly. If you are sensitive to constant beeping sounds, florescent lights, or cool temperatures, it's also not a particularly great sensory environment...especially at the check-out.On a typical day at work, you clock in, ask your manager where they want to put you for the day, go follow that directive, and possibly be interrupted mid-task some time later to be moved to another section. The last part is not pleasant if you had come in dressed and prepared for indoor conditions and they decide to toss you outside at the garden center door. If you work on the general sales floor, you can take your morning, lunch, and afternoon breaks on time and use the bathroom as needed. However, if you are manning the checkout, the electronics section, or the doors, you must wait for someone to relieve you for breaks, and there is a bad tendency to delay workers' breaks in those areas. Sometimes, they don't relieve you for your 15 minute breaks at all, and it's not uncommon to be forced to wait an hour and a half after your scheduled lunchtime before finally being relieved. At the checkout, sometimes you end up staying well past - more...",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Greenwood, IN",6/21/22,2022,6,21

Avoid this company like the black plague.,"I have worked for this company for 5 years and it's the same political drama. They will keep you in a position if you're good at it. Alongside keeping you in a position for so long. They will also give you a lower quality of sleep, because they will eventually make you work at l1pm and then have to come back in at 4am in the morning. Imagine how exhausted and overworked you'll be just to get paid minimum wage? Lastly, if you commute far, They will make you come in for 5 hour shifts. This is not very optimal considering gas prices. This company is the bottom of the barrel. One should only use as a last resort type of deal. Avoid it unless you need a job where you'll be underappreciated  and taken advantaged of.

It is a good job and it pays good. Without a doubt the best warehouse job there is but I would caution into making it a long term career because a time will come where your body does not stop hurting from all the physical work or if an accident happens and you can't physically do the job anymore you are sol with no experience for any other field of work.

Never be Salary,Over the last few Years Walmart has been working to minimize it's workforce to the detriment of it's associates.

Coworkers were very quick to step in and make up for the lack of training provided by management and made walmart a great place to work. I was always either extremely bored due to a lack of orders to fill or very overwhelmed by an extreme number of orders.

Standards are low. Most people don't really follow the rules and do what they please. Don't expect to go in and do what you're supposed to cause you're usually doing someone else's job. Do expect that you won't be provided with all the equipment you need to do your job. It was stressful to work most days because management couldn't stay on one page. In the end of the day, it's a fairly easy job if you don't stress too much about it. I advise to not jeopardize your mental health to keep working there.

"Great Job, managers not so much….","This is a great place to work and is very inclusive when it comes to people and cultures, but there were a few bad apples. There were frequently individuals who would extend their breaking by almost 20 minutes, leaving some individuals no break throughout the day due to there sometimes being very busy days. Time goes by extremely fast so that’s one of the many things i loved about this job. You would also be rewarded if they feel that you were succeeding as a team. When it comes to management me being there we ran through about 4 different managers in 6 months, the first few were great in my opinion, but the newest one was terminating people over the smallest mistakes due to there have being around 13 or so individuals hired. So just keep your A game is what i took away from the experience focus on yourself and your job because no one is there to help you out.

High Pay with No Balance ,At the time I departed walmart I had recently moved up from ASM to Co Manager. Like my title says the pay can be amazing with bonus I made north of 130k my last year (New Orleans median income is 38.5k for the area) however I was putting in at least 80 and sometimes 90 hours a week. It’s a high stress very fast pace and many times rewarding job. I spent 13 years with the company and it had its ups and downs. Overall I will say it was a favorable experience as the resume I built their has helped my continuing growth in management. Had a lot of great folks work with/for me over the years. My recommendation is if you are in your 20’s and don’t have kids yet take the plunge and get some great XP in management. If you have kids don’t do it because it just doesn’t leave any time for you to be a good dad. ,4,Former Employee,Co-Manager/Manager ,"New Orleans, LA",6/18/22,2022,6,18

"How well teams work and are motivated, are a direct reflection of Management.","One of the cleanest Walmarts I've been in.

They have no idea how to motivate their employees. They are not only rude to their team members but their customers as well. Disgraceful. Some leaders need Time Management classes desperately. When you need help, they are no where to be found. Overall, the leaders do not possess the skills needed for the position they have been given especially in communicating with their teams in a positive manner.

It makes it hard for some of those who suffer from aniexty, because you are constanly worrying about if you're fitting in, when all you should be worrying about is getting the job done and going home.

Love working at Wal-Mart,Very fast paced work in the summer it's very humid overall I would recommend working at Walmart. Everyone gets along with each other.

Decent job as long as you have good management,"Most of the time you're just tossed into the job after going through 2-3 hours of irrelevant online instructional videos. Management is almost always terrible, even more so if you get a terrible team lead. My Walmart had my team unload trucks, set up for trucks, work grocery freight and General Merchandise freight, zone, etcetera... I was recently fired because of a policy where you have to have the PPTO at the time of the occurrence but they give you seven days to put it in. Never knew that so I started to come in 30 minutes later and use my PPTO I got the next day. They told me I should have learned that in orientation but I didn't even know how many points I could accrue until 3-4 months into my job. If you have good Management and work Cap 1 you'll probably like it, relatively easy job but the Management makes it a pain. It was my first job, I learned a lot from it and I would still be working there if I could as they pay for your college but the Management or in this case lack of management is the deal breaker.",2,Former Employee,Stock Associate ,"Augusta, GA",6/16/22,2022,6,16
Being able to assist customers with their groceries.,"Start my day being assigned a register front end or at the cosmetics counter. I love working with people being fast and competent and able to assist them in checking out their groceries or other items. Sometimes customers aren't having a good day and I learned  knowing what to say and showing empathy is very much appreciated.Work culture to me is about respecting everyone and team members that have seniority help the new hires., it's about TK- team knowledge so that everybody works together to make sure customers are happy.The hardest part of my job is when customers need a manager about an issue and one can't be found or is busy with another customer and they are kept waiting.The best part of my job is when my customers found all their shopping needs and leave happy with a great shopping experience.",5,Current Employee,Cashier/Front End ,"Brea, CA.

Unprofessional ,"Management is horrible and don't work with you. Talk about you and don't care if you have children as long as their work is out. Make employees do everyone else job and don't train others to learn things. Tools are limited, not enough to perform job duties. Disrespectful and think they can talk to you anyway. High turnover for the way employees are disrespected and talked to. Horrible place to be employed at. Over work employees and don't want to give raises.

Worse place to work ,"The team leads, upper management, coaches aren’t all on the the same page and they don’t do their jobs or teach associates how to properly do their jobs. No hands on training from any of them. They can’t keep any associates or team leads cause the upper management drains everyone quick.

Torture,"No matter what work you get done, if a customer wrecks it, you are at fault for nor doing a good job. If you aren't a cashier, they force you on one anyway and again you would be at fault if your work in your department is left undone because they pulled you onto a register for hours at a time. Management will completely ignore any complaints you have about your job by saying that you just aren't working hard enough. If you work in appearance, other departments just assume you aren't busy and and compliment your work, just to guilt you into working in another section. Sometimes you could be scheduled to work 9 full days in a row. Sometimes you can be scheduled to work until 11pm one night, and 7am the next morning.  I stopped going on 15 minute breaks after our department was scolded for something a customer left on the floor after we were gone. They told us we needed to wait for the night manager to check our department before we left, even though the manager leaves 10 to 15 minutes earlier, so we had to wait 30 minutes for the overnight manager, then they told us we all had to much overtime.

Up tight and stressful environment,"I applied here as a person who does online orders or as a janitor because I know I’m not too good with people.

I Wouldn't Recommend,"While I can't speak for every store, the experience at mine was extremely poor. It's fine to work here if you don't plan on staying or don't have a desire to advance. They pick and chose favorites for promotions. They were pretty accommodating if you needed to have a certain schedule for work or family issues, however, if you didn't have a completely open schedule, you usually got stuck with terrible shifts (i.e. 11-8p, 1-10p, 2-11p).

Don't do it!,They definitely don't care if you have enough ppl to run the store. The management team plays favorites and treats you as expendable no matter how long you have been with the company.

Alright ,"I was a Cashier/Greeter/Stocker/anything the mangers want you to be. They raised the salary of everyone else but cashiers. Mostly me and all the cashier work there for so long but barely no pay raise, or do 22 cent do your fancy.  Some managers alright but some strict. They'll have your back incase of a crazy customer though. They will make you push carts too.

Overworked and Overlooked,"The job seemed easy at first, I was just a simple store associate that helped customers find what they needed. The training was all computer based. I barely spoke to anyone about the job until I was whisked out to the sales floor. My department manager at the time told me to straighten clothes (I was in the apparel department) on specific benches and then immediately left me alone go fend for myself. Two days later I would be managing the whole apparel sales floor myself for a closing shift. Management also stated they would work with me on my school schedule, which turned out to be a lie when the next semester rolled around and my hours had to change.

"Not for everyone, they don’t train, work alone in a team environment","Don’t get me wrong I love this job but it’s definitely not for everyone. They don’t really train you and you have to learn a lot yourself or from the people around you. Overnights don’t really have a welcoming environment, it’s more find out what you are suppose to do and do it. Not a lot is expected of you as long as you get your own work done on time. Walmarts attendance policy is also kinda stupid so make sure you keep on top of absences.

Often times they are angry, tired and grumpy by the time they get to the check out.

I definitely wouldn’t shop there for food because I did return carts almost everyday (mind u I’m personal shopper and never could do my job because there weren’t enough devices) they leave OLD FOOD/fruit in return carts to be put back in the shelves/freezer.

Since the company will not close for any reason, you will be expected to work practically whenever they schedule you including holidays and weekends. If you are absent for shifts, particularly holidays, you will be penalized even more than normal.

Not very “family friendly”… It’s a cooperate based on greed. ,"Hard working associates were more appreciated, about 10-15 years ago… before their cooperate greed took root… I used to love working for this company, and enjoyed what I did. I felt welcome, and included. Now, they have a new system in which they have taken away the bonuses that were quarterly and for all associates, to give to the “managers” that hardly work… They don’t care about associates unless you become close friends with the managers, than you get away with everything… You get plenty of vacation hours, but they will hardly allow you to use them… Most of the time when you do put in vacation time, they end up scheduling you to work on a day during the middle of said vacation, so you can’t plan long trips… They will claim to work around your availabile schedule, but will cut your hours down to hardly anything… They have no regards for their long term employees… so it’s best not to stay for a long duration… The only yearly pay increase you get is 24 cents… They work the strong willed ones like dogs… They will claim to have great benefits, but the only thing that they have going for them now is “Walmart+” which is good if you use online shopping, but it’s not really worth it if you ask me… ",1,Former Employee,Online Grocery Pickup ,"Easley, SC",6/12/22,2022,6,12

"Customers,management, employees in that order.","Training is fine. You get to the point You pre-fer watching training videos than being on the floor. Customers come first for better or worse. Then management.  Management is more worried about getting their bonuses than caring about there employees. You have one title but do everything in the store depending on where they want to pull you to at that moment. Going to management with an issue won't get you anywhere.  If you want management to listen to an issue the only way is to encourage customers to gonto management with their issues. Hourly employees are at the bottom of the totem poll no matter how hard they work. You can go up in the company but only as long as they want you there then they will find a reason to knock you back down or fire you all together. If you have worked there long enough to be full-time and have a fixed schedule and days off there is a target on your back. They offer new ""benefits"" but in reality it's not a benefit because they will just take something else away to make up for it. Ex: higher min. Wage. They up the pay and take away time and a half,holiday pay, bonuses, and yearly wage increases for that one time pay increase.

"Walmart DCs: Not the best, not the worst","The distribution centers are definitely a big step up from the stores, no doubt. However, it's still Walmart, a company which I think does more posturing to employees than actually cares about them. At the end of the day, you're a number, disposable. My job now is easy, I sit in an office on a computer most of the day. I started out unloading trucks, which is not a job for everyone and most don't last long. If you can suffer the back-breaking labor for a year, you'll be in a better position to move up. The pay is good and there are opportunities for overtime at certain times of the year. Hourly associates can make more than area managers this way. The health benefits are okay, wish they were better. ",3,Current Employee,Systems Operator ,"Williamsburg, VA",6/11/22,2022,6,11
How I feel about working at walmart,"If you want something to do to get paid this is the perfect job for a little bit but not a job to use as a career . The management team only care for themselves not there employees , if they get in trouble for something they did they will blame a member  of there team for there mistakes . Instead of positive feedback they only give bad and lowers the morale of the team working . They use there bad days on there employees as well and if you are there favourite they won’t say it discipline you for what you do wrong and just blame on someone else.

Good for time off.,"Over the past 15 years I have watched this company go from respecting their associates, and being considerate of their personal/ family needs to taking jobs away from people, stripping them of their already set days off, forcing them to work weekend days or cut them to part time if they can't, give associates zero understanding or sympathy for missing work due to ill or hospitalized children or self, cut bonuses out entirely, and cut raises to less than 2% of what associates already currently make. They have also cut their full-time hour expectations from 34 to 33 hours, essentially making full-time associates earn part-time wages. There is no financial or family related incentive to work for Walmart anymore. Management does not back-up their associates. There aren't enough people hired to get the jobs done anymore because of company-wide penny pinching to accommodate the higher ups pockets. Associates, stores, and customer experiences are suffering from lack of pay and understanding, unworked freight, and unstocked shelves.",3,Current Employee,Claims Associate ,Florida,6/11/22,2022,6,11

Salaried Management at Walmart,"Walmart was the worst work environment I have ever worked in. This includes 1 bigbox retail direct competitor (1 year+/current job), 1 smaller grocery store chain (19 years), and 2 bigbox non-direct competitors (Combined 3 years). As a salaried manager at Walmart, you become the property of Walmart, and are expected to work any  number of hours that they demand. An individual is on call always. I was denied vacation every year. The lowest amount of earned vacation time that I lost in a fiscal year was two weeks, 3 days. One year I was only allowed to use 5 days total, meaning I lost 31 days off with no compensation. I am disappointed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to be treated the way Walmart treated me.

Turnover is around 90%, so employees were coming and going all of the time.  There is lack of management support starting with the Market Team and going to the Store Manager to the Coaches to the Team Leads.  Much of this is because things are constantly changing.

The schedule app for associates is pretty convenient.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Customers will get mad at you on an individual level for things out of your control.

A lost torch,"   It was once a great company that supported its employees. Now it's a franchise that forgot it was a franchise.   From the upper perspective. Imagine someone handing you the keys to your own car with the condition that you keep it clean and follow the laws of the road. Now imagine after working hard to get the money to get the car you realize that you don't quite own it per se. You figure it's fine because you can still drive wherever you want and they just want to make sure you're sticking to your end. Now imagine they tell you it needs to be cleaned right after you went to a friends place because its got some dirt on it, reguardless of the fact you just got there and it hasn't been a day yet. You say you will clean it when you get the chance to try to me amicable, but they threaten you with repossession if you don't fullfill your contract. You grumble but do a quick clean, then got to the store and get supplies to clean the car on the go. Now you have to clean the car every time you drive at all but you still get to go wherever so its fine. Next you go to to a shop to see about a new stereo to enjoy your music in your car. You get another call stating you can't modify the car or how it functions reguardless of the fact that it doesn't hamper it's function.   I know it's odd to describe a business as a car but it's just as odd to claim someone has ownership and then turn around and dictate their use of what they own. Add to that any demands made come out of your pocket instead of the one whos making the demands.   From the lower perspective.

We were in our own little corner and I feel upper management overlooked the talent they had at their disposal. We were set to provide a huge breakthrough, but the company changed direction and started the process of outsourcing what we were already providing. This created overlap and diminished all the progress we made along with the assets we created. We went from feeling extremely important to feeling like we didn't belong in a short period.

Better pay than others but more stresses and annoyances.,"Depending on your dept the pay is very good compared to other retail competitors. With that being said the experience really falls on how well HR handles scheduling to ensure you are staffed enough for those busy days and whether management is professional. From my experience at my store if you’re full time you will get your 40 hours but part timers have been having their hours cut. This causes a few issues when people call out and staffing is low.  Management will generally have their favorites and the cliques are pretty rampant in some departments. All in all pretty good pay with 2 types of pto, insurance, LOAs, and tuition options but that’s assuming you can last long enough in the toxic work environment to benefit from said options.

Wanna be gas lit?,At Walmart your managers will throw you under the bus to pad their bonus checks.  You won’t ever receive positive comments but daily threats about your availability and job security.  Basically Walmart’s policy is no fun or enjoyment in the work place.  Management is crooked and are protected.  Managers who still work here (2022) have been caught of sending explicit messages to lower tier staff and still have employment. ,1,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Boone, NC",6/7/22,2022,6,7

Horrible ,I have been there a year and 6 months. I do multiple jobs that aren’t even my position and we don’t get paid the same. The Team Leads disappear. The pay is awful. I definitely feel unappreciated. I’ve only gotten 1 dollar raise since I’ve been there. Many have been working there 10 plus years and are only getting paid 13 like everyone else.

Overall summary,"There are different departments that people can work in. People get hired into a position applied for. I have learned how to run a register and work at the service desk. I feel as though the more I work at Walmart the more it feels like management does not care about their associates. Wanting to transfer departments may not be easy if there is no one able to replace your spot. The hard part about working at Walmart is that each department gets paid differently. Which I think each department should get paid the same. I also think that people should get cross trained in different departments. Only a few people get cross trained and then when help is needed, it’s not there. ",3,Current Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Bangor, ME",6/6/22,2022,6,6

Fairly relaxed environment and simple job,"Walmart is an okay place to work and that's about where I would stop, it's okay. I worked overnight shifts and that's the shift that has the most physical labor attributed to it. My main gripe about the place is slackers aren't really punished and over achievers aren't really rewarded. Many a day I would do my work in half the time, and my only reward would be to help a person who would do the opposite, only getting half their work done in the time allotted. This went on for a year with no change. The benefits are average, it's just a very mediocre place to work. If you really need money, it's kind of chill, and not very difficult. That's what it most has going for it.",4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Sales Associate ,Pennsylvania,6/6/22,2022,6,6
It's Walmart,"It really depends on your management and your peers but the culture within corporate of trying to push and push and verbally abusing your staff if they work under you is awful. I'm not someone who has to deal with it directly, but it is literally encouraged within market management to make your employees feel as small as possible so you can see how much they're willing to do or take for the minimum amount of compensation. I've had fantastic managers and team leads/coaches but their managers treat them like absolute garbage. I don't understand the point in it being this way. I also feel like if your systems rely on employees giving obscene amounts of overtime as a way to keep it running means that your system or scheduling isn't working and that you should hire more people, but Walmart has always prioritized numbers and profit margins over actual workplace growth.",2,Current Employee,Overnight Associate ,"Charleston, WV",6/6/22,2022,6,6
Meat grinder mentality with poor management,"If you want to get chewed up and spat out, then this is a great place to work. It's the kind of soul sucking job where any enjoyment you get out of it is in SPITE of the company's practices. It's the kind of job that feels like an abusive relationship. It may demean you, belittle you, and grossly underpay you, but it somehow has an ability to trick people into thinking they have no better options. You either get out early or are stuck there for a decade at least.It has no respect for the people who actually stick around through the hard times.

"Good Temp job, but soul sucking if you stay too long","Overall, the lower management were fine. From team lead to store manager.

"Terrible place to work, plain and simple.","Want an easy to get into job that pays poorly, expects you to be prideful, work urgently, not complain or even talk to your coworkers? How about a job where you go nowhere, do the same monotonous tasks day after day, and even if you ask for some variety, youre told to shut up, deal with it, or go home? That is what Walmart is like. You generally get tasked with 1 location and are expected to never ask to do anything else, so if you dont like stocking grocery items or the dairy cooler? Too bad, thats all youll ever do. Team leads (supervisors) either care too much or dont care at all, and god help you if you get a shift with both. Coaches (shift managers) are pushovers, letting other shifts that arent theirs walk all over them but get upset if you have a complaint. You dont get holidays off, only managers get that priviledge, and im pretty sure you dont get time and a half or double time.

Yet every employee is required to do them. I have asked many times for a locker and haven't recieved one. Beware. They can change your job at a moments notice. I picked items now I stock. Be careful, they will also try to change your hours and may give you an ultimatum. Management is not concerned with work conditions and workload distribution. They also hurry and ridicule employees while at the same time pushing their own agendas that have no effect on anyone but management. Management will push a shopping cart and collect things, walk around talking, be hidden, or be on someone's last nerves. Everyone is encouraged to stock the shelves without bringing freight back to the back. This promotes plugging (fitting an item where it will go instead of where it was assigned). They don't want to see you plug but they don't want any freight taken back either. They question anyone bringing freight back regardless if you had 14 pallets to stuff in 4 aisles . It's a catch 22.

They know that online grocery is the money maker of the company so they work that department to death. They do not have the manpower for the amount of orders that they take on. Instead of capping, they tell employees to work faster and that they must reach a certain number of picks or they will be fired. (Even though they need you way more than you need them LMAO) if you like sprinting around a store all day and want over time they will give you over time. It might not have been such a bad experience at a different location with different management but I would not recommend this location. At least not the online grocery pickup department. I've met people in other areas of the store who have worked for Walmart over 30 years and are satisfied. Also, the “discount” you receive is so disrespectful they might as well not give you one.

Very little support from management when you needed one it was very difficult to find one. On the other hand you do have some managers that you can count on and help you out with where you want to go. Working overnight is a bit of depressing situation because it is usually dark out when you go to work and after work. I feel like  this company needs to work around somethings and help those who are within their company already to help them succeed. When I was originally going for my business degree I was told there was no internship. Yet, later on when my internship at another company was done and completed I ended up seeing they were hiring for an internship.

I was hired to work part time in dairy/frozen and got my first department manager position after 6 months of employment.

The training was okay, there were lots of videos to watch during the onboarding but I did feel like I got thrown in pretty early.

The work environment is uncomfortable and I would not recommend this job for anybody to work at for the rest of their life. MANAGEMENT also decided to make me FULL TIME knowing darn well I attend college. FULL TIME hours mean that I have a hard time focusing on my schoolwork and I have more built up stress which heavily impacts my academics and overall well being. I also HATE having to deal with rude customers weekly and entitled people who think that the world revolves around them.

Cart pushing is exhausting and heavily under staffed most days,I work at a fairly busy walmart as a cart attendant with full time 6am to 3pm mornings are fairly nice until about 11am we start to get very busy. Sometime we are staffed ok but more than not we need more people. As I stated I come in at 6 am friday-tuesday and leave at 3 Friday they get 1 other in at 8 and rarely 1 in at 10 or 11 they will usually just put a cashier out to help but most don't do much because they are not really required to. On Friday we always get atleast a 3rd person in by 1pm but by that point we're so busy and far behind that it dosent do much good. saturdays are usually way better and we get 4 people total by 12pm sometimes still cashiers but we need 2 people for each side sometimes 3 are even needed for the grocery side. Sunday is more less the same as Saturday. Mondays are dreadful they staff only 2 of us until 4pm which yet again we are in a fairly busy walmart so we heavily struggle to maintain carts and usually have multiple periods a day where there are no carts in stock. To add to being heavily understaffed most of the time whislt pushing carts were pushing them up a somewhat steep hill making it quite difficult to actually push said carts.,2,Current Employee,Cart Attendant ,"222 E Smokerise Dr, Wadsworth, OH",5/31/22,2022,5,31

Corporate encourages life-long learning and provides a way to further education.  Options for benefits are great.Cons: Some people work harder than others and still get paid the same.

"High Stress, Little Reward for Long Term Associates","I have worked for this company for over 10yrs. Mostly as a hourly supervisor. It is a very high stress job once you get into any management level. Unfortunately the company promotes people that are extremely driven to move up but usually lack people skills. The problem is mostly from the top. They want more results with less people and expectations are usually out of reach. Constant change of positions and responsibilities make it hard to keep up. They recently took away bonuses under the guise of big raises, but the raises were not for everyone and now associates that are long term find themselves making the same as people that just walked through the door. No schedule flexibility, they want you to be available 24/7 unless you are in very specific roles. Some customers are unhappy before they even walk in the door so that can be challenging, but there are plenty of kind and understanding people to even out. I personally enjoyed working with my coworkers and most of the lower level salary managers. Health benefits, 401k and PTO are pretty good. This can be a good place for someone that is not easily stressed out and works well with others. ",3,Current Employee,Team Lead ,Florida,5/30/22,2022,5,30
Stay Away from Global Tech Division,"Nothing matters more than ""running"" cranking out things as fast as possible and if important details are missed, that's ok, you'll get to those later, but at least you're seen running.......like a chicken with its head cut off. Layoffs are frequent, there is a glut of management, contractors may or may not get converted, and it's a dysfunctional environment akin to a modern plantation with corporate staff being the main beneficiaries, until you're laid off. The store Associates are the drivers for corporate bonuses (10, 15, 20+k per year) and good salaries but their return is minimal. Maybe a vest pin or something. Group think ""feelgoodism"" promotes that corporate really cares about store Associates through the small tokens they provide. It's laughable and transparent. Most all of those who feel great about working at Walmart are those who are making real money at Corporate and store management levels. The rest get the scraps and as such, aren't as enthused.   I wouldn't work there ever again. I think those who have been there so long have settled into and become a part of the preestablished dysfunction.

Only job where I was mad fun of for working hard and trying to get things done the fastest way I could.,Overall like any big corporation they cut corners where the people at the bottom of the ladder have to work unnecessarily harder.

Decent work with bad management ,My time at Walmart was interesting.I worked in the Deli at Walmart and started at 11.50 an hour and got moved to 15 an hour within 6 months. You will be provided with a vest to wear over your normal clothing. You will be given a discount card to get 10% off certain select items after 6 months. After a year you will be allowed to use there insurances and 401k. During your shift you are permitted two fifteen minute paid breaks with an hour unpaid lunch that you must take. Management does pay overtime but will take disciplinary action towards you for staying over your normal work schedule since they are very reluctant to give overtime to anyone. You are allowed to have up to 5 occurrences/absences before you are put on a termination list and terminated at the end of the month. 1 occurrence will go away after 6 months from the date you obtained it. You will be using an app to clock in and out of work with your phone though they still had card swipers to clock in and out when I was still working with Walmart they were planning to fully phase those out and have you just use the app. Each department varies on pay and of course management but at the end of the day I can honestly say management does not care for it's associates as well as other companies do.,2,Former Employee,Walmart Deli Associate ,"Ladson, SC",5/30/22,2022,5,30

Not worth it,"I worked as a personal shopper for 4 months. When you are gathering products for orders you are expected to maintain a set “pick rate” which is used to determine how fast you gather the items. It does not take into account time helping customers, finding products that are back stocked, top shelfed requiring ladders and special equipment to get down or products stock levels being off which happened a lot.When you’re dispensing, the other part of the job, you’re going outside to put the product in the customer’s cars. Rain, sleet or snow, you’re going outside. During rainy days I’d have to dispense all 8 hours of my shift leaving me drenched from head to toe the entire shift.I missed a few shifts when I went through a rough breakup and then missed several more when I got the stomach flu.

I would get told that I could do certain jobs because I didn't have to be babysitted but yet two people that couldn't stop texting each other even change their schedule to be on the same schedule every day because they are a boyfriend and girlfriend got hired full time.

Great pay. Job security free College and tuition great family/work balance able to advance.,I love working at Walmart. It’s steady and pays very well. We never shut down during Covid so we always had a paycheck and safety bonuses. Medical and dental and 401k and stock options if interested.

"Hostile environment, lots of cliques amoung management ","Used to be great place to work at, but recently management has become very clique-like. Can be very hostile, and days are always long, 12+ hours.

Mostly good but expect nothing more,"Pay is good. There’s been about 5 pay raises since the pandemic. Management is subpar. The work is meaningful until it’s not.

Enjoyed Coworkers do not agree with how it is ran,Management is just not organized and you never know what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis.

The managers who did do work got fired but the lazy ones are still there.,3,Former Employee,Support Manager ,"Shrewsbury, MO",5/26/22,2022,5,26
It’s kinda meh.,It was okay it’s Walmart ya know. They’ll work you up to 39 hours but don’t wanna pay you full time so they don’t have to give you benefits. The pay is not great but the work is easy and the staff are cool.,5,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Cashier ,"Oklahoma City, OK",5/26/22,2022,5,26

They constantly make absurd business decisions to drive employees out of the company. Completely bizarre.,2,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"Huntley, IL",5/26/22,2022,5,26
Management plays favorites ,Worked here for years and if you aren’t part of the managements little club then you aren’t worth dirt to them even if you have worked there a long time. You can work your hardest to make up for multiple people quitting in your department but management won’t respect that or even give you a thanks. Instead they will act as if you aren’t working hard enough to keep up with the job of a whole team. Their favorites get away with anything of course. If you are good at sucking up to management and like stale candy or the occasional burnt pizza party for your troubles then this is the job for you.,1,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Rochester, IN",5/26/22,2022,5,26

Lack of respect from management.  Lack of communication. Lack of support for family issues. Being fired for helping family. ,I was with the company for 17yrs and was fired for being a caregiver for 5yrs of a family member. Missing time is not a option. They do not support important decisions that a family needs to make on a everyday basis when one's life is at a critical time. The company doesn't support common law and neither does the state of Maryland. ,1,Former Employee,Team Lead ,"Hampstead, MD",5/26/22,2022,5,26
Biggest Mistake of my LIFE,"So many people told me not to apply at Walmart, horrible atmosphere, no camaraderie, if managers know people they'll hire them and kick you to the curb. When you show them proof of things they ignore you. When you are trying to move forward and move above they fire you. When you ask for help they don't give it to you! The only way you would be successful at a Walmart store is if you are the following... Backstabbing a liar willing to throw anyone under the bus to get ahead have no empathy ",1,Former Employee,Asset Protection Associate ,"Suisun City, CA",5/26/22,2022,5,26
Never work there,They never cared about my well being. When I got injured there they had me siting in a 8x8 room for eight hours.  All they cared about is the customers and never the associates.,1,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Bennington, VT",5/26/22,2022,5,26
stressful fast paced workplace,my store specifically is bad but I think walmart as a company is bad to work at. We're already understaffed so a typical day depending on where you work will have you pulled from your position over to OGP.

Productive but can be rough depending on department ,"So far the company isn’t bad to work for, it’s basically where you work in the company that can either make or break you. What I mean is that once you’re in and show that you do well you have the option to move to another department (if hours are available) that you feel best and enjoy doing. Sometimes you have to do things outside of your job code but you are paid for everything you do.  The last thing that may be hard on people is that each department has different pay so you may want to do research and see where you’d like to go before settling in a position you may not enjoy pay wise.

They believe they own you,"We do everyone's jobs, including Manager's, except our own, with no extra pay, of course. We work departments we were never trained in, but expected to just know it.  The newest thing, you must work the ""teaming"" schedule they offer you, or they threaten you with less hours.  ""Either take the days and times we give you, or we can't promise you 40 hours"".  They don't care if you have kids, family, school to work around. People with 15+ years, are expected to change their days off with no warning, just take it or leave it. Favoritism is another big issue, tho they will swear up and down it doesn't happen. It most definitely does!  If you want to advance, you need to kiss up.

the pay was okay but the work was too much with way too many responsibilities,"my breaks were constantly delayed, management is friendly with minimal control over making the work more bearable, this job has caused me to have pain in my left hip. paid time off is okay, not as many hours as needed. pay is also not very great, not a good job for people with children.

What's important about that statement is ""when"" Hours have been cut and management relies on associates to do their job. Training is almost nonexistent.

"It’s Walmart, so I don’t think I have anymore to elaborate on",It is a fast paced work environment and most times you have a pretty good working environment and the employees all work together and as a team. I was a closing front end cashier and liked that I was able to have the later shifts but always found it hard to swap shifts with coworkers because our schedules were “teaming schedules” not sure how that works but that was hard to deal with. Management was ok sometimes easy and helpful other times didn’t bother to try and help with whatever it was employees were needing help with.

was good at first,The job was very great at first but slowly worsened as time went on. I'm not saying every Walmart is like that but at the one I worked at it was. Not all of the management was bad but not good either. A typical day at work was usually bring out a pallet of dairy or frozen and stock it in a certain amount of time.  They  great with flexible schedules if you are in school or in college.

I’d say just make your lil money and don’t take ANYTHING personal Walmart has a lack in a lot of areas and if corporate did visit without the knowledge of management they’d see a lot more of what’s going on truly.

Cool job for busy places. ,Pay is ok. Unless you get multiple orders.  And it have to deliver then way far from Walmart. Don't get pay to return to store. And hardly get new orders unless in a certain spot around the city or store. And not always the same spot. Takes a while in most cases to get the order from store employees even though there is hardly any drivers. Or not enough store employees to load vehicles. Store shoppers are slow. And get orders on phone before they are even ready. Or get an order that ready and not allowed to pick it up for 15 to 30 mins. Ie kingman. ,4,Current Employee,Spark delivery driver ,"Flagstaff, AZ",5/25/22,2022,5,25

Starting pay is great-great ,PROs...The pay is more than the simular companies around & seems like our manager is letting us get learn other jobs & cross train after a little while.Cons..They do work with you on your production but Its still very difficult to achieve so you have to hear about it constantly. (very unfulfilled feeling after you've gave %110) However they do  continue to encourage you as  they give you your production slips.Later on I may feel different but for now IMO its unfair to the team and the team managers it needs to be achievelable by more than just %5.,4,Current Employee,Breakpack ,"Cullman, AL",5/25/22,2022,5,25
Wouldn’t recommend ,Store manager and Management makes it a hostile environment. Many associates lack the urgency that Walmart would like for a associate to have so they put all the tasks on the good workers because of it. No accountability whatsoever from anyone. You are overworked to the max. Management is very disrespectful to the associates. Corporate is never considered with associates and neither is the market manager.,1,Current Employee,Apparel Associate ,"Santa Clarita, CA",5/25/22,2022,5,25
Not like it used to be.,"For an entry level, basic retail job it was great. Clean, safe, secure. There was the possibility of growth and promotion, even bonuses and holiday parties.

Its a good pay so thats why i stayed plus i moved states. Another thing was if a person worked there for even 5 months or more they will literally boss any new comers around like they are the boss. I thought they were trying to help me settle and get use to the job the job but the just made me do the work they didn't want to do and I couldn’t tell any higher ups because they were never around.,2,Former Employee,Personal Shopper/Stocking Associate ,"Las Vegas, NV",5/24/22,2022,5,24

"If you value your current mental/physical health, don’t apply","This job is not worth the stress. The work environment is 1000% hostile.

Your concerns will be ignored, and if you have any questions, expect to be sent in circles just to be given multiple INCORRECT answers from management. 1st and 2nd shift do absolutely nothing while 3rd shift gets ALL of the work load. You are punished for being sick, requesting time off (good luck spending time with your loved ones on the holidays. They black out every holiday, even the days before and after it, so you aren’t allowed to request them off) and not getting 25+ hours worth of work done by yourself in an 8 hour shift.

You will be able to run a team in a fast environment. You will never be bored, there is always something to do and departments always need helpThe team atmosphere does radiate within each department.

You are on your feet at all times and moving always and helping the next customer or associate. Hardest part of my job has been the cooperation from upper management, during tough times of low staffing and busy weekends and holidays, help is needed, but seldom provided.

I couldn't have been more wrong! They provide you with equipment (a phone) that does not work properly and expect you to take photos of every bar code on each item that you pick. Unfortunately, the equipment sucks, loses internet connection constantly and slows you down. Then you get yelled at because your pick rate isn't fast enough. They also pressure you to download their work app to your personal phone and use that instead, which most of us refuse to do. One of the worst problems is that they have no system in place to keep people from cheating (taking the fast pick walks) and leaving you with the slower walks. We are timed on how many items we pick per hour.The manager demands you stay and do over time, instead of asking you if you can stay. Even if you have an appointment, the manager will insist you stay if they need you. They also ask you to take 30 minute lunches when it's busy and you often can't take your 15 minute breaks.",1,Former Employee,Eccomerce Personal Shopper ,"Leesburg, FL",5/23/22,2022,5,23

Great opportunities; poor work life balance,Walmart has so many growth opportunities that you can be involved in. Your willingness to move is a big factor for the company. Work life balance is not ideal for those with families. This is a retail environment that operates with only 2 paid days off. Even in a leadership role you may be required to work those days.

Pretty good first job,"Overall, not bad job someone starting their first job. I got my job during the summer of 2020 and it was pretty chill for the most part. They do require that you're standing and actively doing something you're entire shift whether that be moving things around or doing quality checks so if you're someone that can't be up for hours then I wouldn't recommend. Also in general if you're not careful, you could come home with a sore back every day so make sure you're watching your technique on lifting and moving heavy items. The people I worked with were pretty cool from what I remember. If you're quiet, then you can easily keep to yourself and if you're more extroverted then you can chat up as many people as you want as long as you're still working. The pay was pretty good for a first job and the managers were pretty cool. If you weren't good at a particular part of the job (for me, it was picking groceries), then someone will definitely be there to help you if you ask. Again, pretty nice for a first job. I'm only giving it 3 stars because I personally don't like heavy lifting all the time and at one point, I was doing a job that required a lot of lifting all by myself and it usually takes around 2-3 people to get it done in a timely and efficient manner. Because I'm an overachiever, I would get it done quickly by myself anyways but I didn't appreciate being the only doing that particular job with no assistance as it really started messing with my back.",3,Former Employee,Online Order Fulfillment ,"Greenwood, IN",5/21/22,2022,5,21

"Toxic, Favoritism, Nothing gets done about ethics issues",Workplace is full of managers who pick favorites and give them special privilege while screwing over less favored associates.

Unsure of the Company's Future Direction,"Having worked for this company for multiple decades, I have watched it successfully stay up to date and change to meet the needs of the ever-changing customer.Working for the company has been great for most of my career and in years past, I would recommend it as a great place to work.However, over the last five years, the company has greatly reduced the workforce in the brick-and-mortar locations and is moving towards a more digital footprint in the retail environment (as it should to stay relevant).This strategy is having an overall negative impact on the employees' morale and, in turn, affecting the customer experience. The workload of salaried and hourly employees is almost too much. The company structure is geared towards every single person being empowered and working at top capacity and this, in my opinion, is unrealistic.No one is ever going to have every single employee working at top level every minute of every day.And overworked leaders are not going to be effective in ensuring that overworked employees are doing what is required to make this unrealistic expectation a reality.As a result of this structure and workload, I have seen more leaders and employees leave the company over the last two years than I can ever remember leaving in the same time frame over the course of my career.According to the home office, they are aware of this, but I'm not sure what they can do about it.  I don't see this current direction as being sustainable for years to come.

The management however are usually rude, expect too much from employees and cut hours as see fit giving you barely enough to be considered full time.

Health benefits get more expensive and less coverage every year.  Other than the drug coverage(which is really only good for some common generics) the $5500 deductible plan is almost useless.

"Stressful, Rude People and Underpaid","I've been front end worker (cashier & self-checkout) for Walmart for a month now and it genuinely sucks. To begin, lots of customers are rude and don't care about your self being. There's some that will treat you like trash and get mad over little things. They will always find something to complain about. Of course there are some nice customers but they're rare to come across to. Cashiering is stressful as not only are you dealing with people and scanning their items, you also have to bag those items (if they want bags) which makes me want to die due to how annoying and time consuming it is. People also buy large amounts of food which is aids to scan and bag. The lines are never ending so you never catch a break. Self-checkout on the other hand is way better since you're just standing for 95% of the time and help customers with problems they might have. Overall though, it's just very strenuous work to do just to get paid minimum wage. You're better off elsewhere",3,Current Employee,Front Desk Clerk ,"Hartford, CT",5/20/22,2022,5,20
one of the best paying traps in town.,"The store that I worked for was very clique based. Most of the salaried managers only cared about protecting themselves the teams under them merely a means to a bonus. One I might add that the corporation decided the hourly associates didn't need since they got base pay increases, most of them at least, across the board. While management all got a base pay increase from hourly team leads to salaried management. You never knew which manager was looking to help you succeed and which one was trying to get you fired for being a bit to open about the mistreatment of the employees.The pay for most was better than you can find in most factories in my location and the benefits are good. The treatment however, if you weren't one of the favored expect to do 3 to 7 times your designated workload while the people whose job you are doing so they don't have to get all the accolades for the job getting done. Even the salaried managers had a massively high turnover rate due to the unfair treatment and expectations laid upon them by upper management. The founder of walmart would be ashamed.",1,Former Employee,Automotive Technician ,"Independence, KS",5/19/22,2022,5,19
Fun job ,I worked set up turning the store into a super center. My job was fun. Working with so many different people each day was nice. From corporate to hourly workers like myself.

Not the place to build a career.,"Overall, Walmart seems to be a seasonal job nonetheless. You'll see people come and go, and those who stay tend to only be management and those close to retirement. At my store communication between management and associates, is primarily the issue. Be prepared to use really old equipment that really can be a safety hazard, and expect to see management not care for it. Though they promote ""True"" availability, you must be aware that it most likely wont be true, as they do limit the days and hours you can work and won't accept most accommodations needed. There are also no incentives to work the second shift so be aware of that. As of this Review, countless stores are facing large understaffings and immediately affect those associates coming in new, being expected to complete work quotas for crews double to even tripple the actual size of the current crew while still learning. There will be times where you are sent off to different departments and doing their work at a lesser pay rate, solely because of this understaffing crisis. If choosing a warehouse or grocery position, be careful and take care of yourself, as I know of countless incidents where workers have gotten hurt and seem to have very little support by upper management. The work environment, doesn't encourage associates to be vocal about their concerns, want to climb up the ladder and get promoted, or just be enthusiastic about their jobs. The only thing positve is the people you get work with as many are in the same situation of trying to find a decent place to work.

#3782 is a train wreck,"I set my availability to be Friday Saturday and Sunday because I’m a college student who is full time and they disregarded it. I went to managers who said “if the company requires you to work, we can schedule you against your availability” to which I reminded them I’m a college student who has class on those days, they said “I’ll bring it up in a meeting”. A few days later they said “because you’re a college student we can make this disappear. This told me that my true availability, which they swear up and down MUST be honored by the company, doesn’t matter at all and that the company comes first. The only reason they “helped” me was because if they prioritized work over my college schedule, managers would be fired. They didn’t care about me, they cared about consequences for messing with me.

They had the attitude that you should already know how to do the job even though you are new. I received very little training regarding the job assignment  I had. Regardless of how hard you worked the constantly received negative feedback.  It was nearly impossible to contact Human Resources if you needed to handle personal business.

Just don't. ,"As a cart associate, you are bottom of the totem pole. You are outside in all kinds of weather: rain, snow, etc. The only exceptions being when there is lightning or if the temperature is too extreme. But even then you're still expected to do the job. And despite constantly being out in the elements, you make the same $15/hr as everyone else. The Walmart I work at has no working cart pusher machine so everyone uses tow ropes for 20 carts. The carts are constantly locked up and it took a moving of the Earth to get a manager to order a new remote to unlock them and even then, they ordered the wrong thing at first. Even if you tell them you need a fixed schedule, they'll attempt to sneak a schedule by you where they changed your days off. If you attempt to leave early, they will attempt to guilt trip you into staying due to decisions made by management. Specific to the Oneida, NY Walmart, they will only schedule one or two people at a time to cover the entire lot and have no one to cover your breaks then be annoyed when you get behind.",2,Current Employee,Cart Associate ,"Oneida, NY",5/17/22,2022,5,17

They have 2 10hr shift day and night and one 12 hr shift on the weekend days and one weekend shift at night(11hrs). You only get a lunch break for a 12 hr shift. The money is great tho and worth it.

Decent at best,"Having worked at two different stores, I can personally say that your experience will depend on the location, as no two Walmarts are entirely the same, in regards to the management team (that's always ever-changing), the specific stores culture, and the overall treatment of employees.Both stores I worked for were incredibly lenient towards my need to change days off. The pay changed from 10 an hour, to 13 over the span of 4 years. Most employees feel that they're underpaid, and aren't as valued as they should be.Policies change every few months in general. The call in point system is decent, when one considers ppto. However, many feel that part time employees are shafted in that regard, because ppto time is dependent on the amount one works.I have had issues with management in the past, but without incredibly strict policy, there's no real way around it for any business. I think it's also important to note that Walmart has an incredibly high turnover rate.Overall it's a decent place to work temporarily, but I would strongly advise against searching for a potential career with the company  ",2,Former Employee,Cap 2 Associate ,"Jefferson City, TN",5/17/22,2022,5,17

Challenging but rewarding,"Walmart has a history of toxic management. It’s almost a prerequisite for hire. My goal as a member of management was to show appreciation, offer feedback without the negativity even when the feedback was negative.  Too often the “I am better than you” attitude that the management has ruins associate engagement and performance. Too often bad behavior was rewarded and hard work to those that stay on task had more work piled on. I reversed that which made me unpopular with fellow managers.

Wasn't too bad but the managers suck.,"Working at Walmart wasn't that bad in my experience. Cap2 or the Unloading/backrooms team made a good amount of pay just for basically working out. Your typical day would be you getting there at the back and having a group meeting with the rest of your co-workers, and your team lead. People are then chosen for what they are supposed to be doing the rest of the day if they are not required to be in the back. Then everyone would get to work. Most enjoyable part about the job was towards the end of the day after everything has been complete. Your final hours would usually be you just walking the floors and stocking shelves and making sure everyone is okay on the shopping floors.

Working here is only good if you really need money,"When I first started working at Walmart, it’s been an okay start, but after the first few weeks, things just went downhill. The employees had nothing better to do than gossip about each other behind each other’s backs, then act as if everything was he he and ha ha in each other’s faces, the higher ups don’t actually care about anyone or anything other than themselves, and don’t even get me started on entitled customers. I just minded my business for the most part but couldn’t help but feel negative about the overall environment and atmosphere. The pay was decent though, for a cashier at least.

"Fun and productive, busy and friendly ","This job is very demanding physically, but fun. It's a busy working environment but you make good money and that makes it worth it also management is really nice",5,Former Employee,OPD associates ,"Twin Falls, ID",5/15/22,2022,5,15
Productive and fast paced work,Get in do your job right and then leave. It's good place for rewarding easy working out kind of work.  Could be better but could be worse. Management will make or break your experience because a few could have you on the way out ,4,Former Employee,Backroom Associate/Stocker ,"West Norriton, PA",5/15/22,2022,5,15
Typical cashier job,Consistent work with typical benefits. Being cashier means mostly busy days slower during the 3rd shift. Management was ok nothing special. Overall was a decent job.,3,Former Employee,Lead Cashier ,"Oviedo, FL",5/15/22,2022,5,15
Okay place to work at for a student ,"Applied as a cashier and ended up as a cart pusher at the age of 18. It took management a whole year to eventually move me to cashier a year later. The job itself was very simple and straight forward. You stand at a register for hours a day and ring people up. Occasionally you get to manage the self check out machines which were fun, or the only register at the cosmetics area which was really boring. My co workers were great and made the job more fun by creating a light hearted environment. I don't know how the management is now but 5 years ago it was great. Con: the customers ",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Antioch, CA",5/15/22,2022,5,15
Pays good but nothing else ,You will get screwed over fast. They promise a lot of people stuff then screw them over every time. Worked here once before and it wasn’t “horrible” but it’s gone down the drain now. ,2,Current Employee,OGP ,"Jacksboro, TN",5/15/22,2022,5,15

Working with new people everyday,"I worked during the pandemic and it was my first job. I chose to do overnight with no prior experience so it was a huge experience for me. My coworkers and managers cared about my well-being  and answered my questions whenever. It wasn’t bad. But I’ll probably will never do overnight again bc a lot is expected to be done overnight especially when you’re short staffed and I don’t think overnight workers are paid enough for the hassle they have to go through each night when they’re short staffed or with just too much stock/over stock. It was also stressful bc managers never wanted pallets full of overstocked products to go back bc the  back room was so small & already full with crate. They had to store pallets in trailer containers outside of the store. P.s They also had me working at apparel alone with no experience , expecting me to finish 6 full pallets. It was very overwhelming for me.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Long Beach, CA",5/15/22,2022,5,15
Don't part-time here,No benefits if you're part time and they will cut part timers to no hours instead of firing them or laying them off when work gets slow.And they do not have flexibility in scheduling at all it seems.,1,Current Employee,Walmart Stocker ,Walmart,5/15/22,2022,5,15

"If you excel at dealing with bs daily, go ahead.","Chronically understaffed with no hope of improvement. People will quit and you will be expected to pick up the slack, they will never hire a replacement. Most positions are flooded with teenagers who do absolutely nothing but complain and leave work for you.Customers IQ scores are lower than the freezer I worked in.Hard workers are punished with more work, you can never do enough.Most associates and some managers are alright though.",2,Former Employee,Frozen and Dairy Associate ,"Mobile, AL",5/15/22,2022,5,15
Enjoyed working at Walmar,Management work with employees to adjust their schedules to accommodate personal and other emergencies or swap hours with another employee. Negative side management slow in disciplining some of the younger generation on attendance and when lacking in doing their job duties. ,5,Former Employee,Stocker/Cashier ,"2720 Watson Blvd Warner Robins, GA",5/14/22,2022,5,14

Terrible ,It was the worst place ever to work they treat everyone like trash there I got fired for being sick during the rise of Covid 19 when you couldn’t get fired for being sick or anything ,1,Former Employee,Cart Attendant ,"Chesterfield, MI",5/14/22,2022,5,14
Steady hours needed,The hours are not always giving when I worked there and the pay has changed since I have been there.  I see new faces all the time when I visit.  If the hours would of matched the pay I would still be there.  Your hours would go 40 plus to 16 hours a week and you have to beg to get more hours.  I liked working with all most everyone.  My questions never got answered by HR because they were not there.  ,4,Former Employee,SFS Order Fullfillment ,"Denton, MD",5/14/22,2022,5,14

How to succeed here,"If you want to be liked and successful in this company you have to be a brown noser. The only way of being promoted here it's if they like you or how high on the ladder your connections are. It doesn't matter your work ethic, how well you know the department, how long you have been with the company or if you are able to communicate in Spanish and English with your fellow associates. As long as you have a connection in the company you are able to be promoted. ",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Orlando, FL",5/14/22,2022,5,14
Would not go back,As a cashier the job was ok. They never had enough cashiers so getting breaks was hard. Then you would get yelled at for not taking them. Management was ok. Fellow cashiers were great people. ,1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Redding, CA",5/14/22,2022,5,14

Finding the right store manager to work for is the key to a great future with Walmart. ,This place could be the most wonderful place to work if they worked as a team and respected each other. The bug wigs are out for money and treat their associates like garbage. Some management treats their people badly and some don't. I always said you can find a great career within walmart it is all about what team you have.,3,Former Employee,Walmart Assistant Manager ,"Louisville, KY",5/14/22,2022,5,14
Easy-going and stable job,"There are many pros if you're a full-time associate. The PTO and PPTO are definitely a perk, and the schedule is very accommodating. I'm able to balance my personal life and work. I enjoy my coworkers, and I love the culture of the store for the most part.  The biggest cons for me however definitely involves management. I've been with the company for about two years now, and I've never had any type of evaluation from a coach or team lead. It's kind of discouraging because I don't know if I'm doing a good job or if there is anything I can improve on. I feel like I'm just an able body or another number. I mean I get it, because it's a big store and there are so many employees that work there. It would just be nice to have some recognition on a personal level. Honestly that is my only complaint about working there. ",4,Current Employee,Team Associate ,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",5/14/22,2022,5,14
Nice people. Poor management,Everybody was really nice. But the management very inconsistent no. You get one manager telling you one thing and another manager telling you another thing. They're always short-staffed because the corporate will not allow them to hire enough people. And there is very little communication. I was fired for violating a rule I didn't know I was violating and instead of telling me I was doing something wrong they just let me keep doing it and then fired me.,3,Former Employee,Front end team associate/Apparel Associate ,"Watertown, NY",5/14/22,2022,5,14
