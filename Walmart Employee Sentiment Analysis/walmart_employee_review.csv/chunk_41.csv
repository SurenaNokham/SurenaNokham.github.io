Production is the main focus,The values that Sam Walton set were awesome but as the company has grown those things have been set aside,2,Former Employee,Processor/ Ship Clerk / DATA PROCESSING ASSOC ,"Statesboro, GA",7/22/13,2013,7,22
Used to be a great company to work for.,I worked for wal mart for almost sixteen years as an overnight mgr. and for most of the time absolutely loved it.  In recent years wal mart let go of it's core values and management became less educated and more like finger pointers just trying to keep themselves out of trouble.  There has been minimal focus on getting the job done and a greater emphasis on trying to make it look like the right things happened.  Sam's values were lost with the invasion of the share holders.,2,Former Employee,OVERNIGHT SUPPORT MANAGER ,Hanover MA,7/22/13,2013,7,22
Not the best place to work,"I started out as a cashier.  However, through my hard work and efforts, I became a Customer Service Manager for nearly a year.  I soon desired to be an Assistant Manager. Of course, I had a bachelors degree and had taken all the Global Management training modules they told me to do.  But management soon turned the tables on me.  They allowed things to go terroribly wrong.  They begin hiring thier personal friends children with no degrees right off the streets, making them Assistant Managers without ever working a day in management.

Great working environment with great chance for advancement in many areas.,My typical day at consist of assisting customers in whatever needs they may have.

There was no hard part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the many different customers throughout the day.,5,Former Employee,cashier/customer service representative ,"Thomasville, GA",7/22/13,2013,7,22
Company with good benefits and gives associates opportunities to advance in their career.,"Customer service, stocking, and receiving/delivering shipments are major tasks at Walmart.  I learned how to deliver good customer service, multi-task projects, work in a fast-paced environment, and how to be a team player.  Management gives guidance and encourages associates to exceed customer service and expectations of the company.  The hardest part of me working at Walmart is the physical labor that comes with the job in which there are many tasks to be completed in a timely manner.  Interacting with different types of people who have similar or very different backgrounds.  Walmart is a very diverse company.",3,Current Employee,Inventory Supervisor ,"Dunkirk, MD",7/22/13,2013,7,22

Consistent work with caring co-workers.,A typical day consists of immediately clocking in if the time permits it. The great thing was that they had several stations throughout the store where I could clock in. After I clock in I check my schedule to make sure I know the days I work. After the schedule checking I would walk to the electronics section and stand behind the station where only employees are allowed. More than likely someone wants to check out or view a locked item. If none of this happens I would find something to do. There is always a cart full of returned items that I could stock on the sales floor. My hourly supervisor is usually within reach if I need help. My co-workers are genuinely nice people. If I need help or they would ask if I need to take a break. The hardest part about working sales is not knowing about certain items and you get questioned the most about it. The part I absolutely love is when I help customers and the happy environment. ,5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lexington, KY",7/21/13,2013,7,21

Which is fine, but I spent a lot of effort there to only feel shafted numerous times. If you need a job, go.

I would then assist by helping customers find certain items, answering any questions they had about on going sales, ring and bag groceries, tender cash, credit, debit, and check transactions as well as helping customers with items out to their car, and on occasions I would greet customers at the door when entering and exiting the store in addition to helping them retrieve shopping carts. While working at Wal-Mart I learned to improve my multi-tasking skills. Management was always on top of things as far as asking them for extra training if needed. I limited myself to very minimal interaction with co-workers to keep from being apart of the ""daily drama"".

The work,"It's easy to advance as long as your availability is completely open and you prove yourself to your direct management.

The hardest part of the job is the massive work load you're expected to do every day, but depending on your management team directly above you, the stress lessens. Many of the co-workers have little to no drive to get their work done though, which increases your work load unless the issue is addressed.

No Teamwork but Great Customer Service,"Typical day is placing picks, counting merchandise, auditing bins, and binning overstock. I was told to not help customers so much, to finish one thing at a time, and not follow demands from my department manager. Management downgrades and manipulates weaker employers by picking at every wrong they have done. Management also is lenient on procrastinators who roam the building while on the clock. Some co-workers have team player attitude and others feel the need to work alone. The hardest part of this job was when being told by one manager to do a task then asked why by another manager, do to poor communication. One enjoyable part about this job is having time to complete a task and working with customers.

The Cons Outweighed the Pros.,"The department I worked in began to go downhill the past two-three months before I finally quit after 8 years of employment at Wal-Mart. I felt management began to lose the ability to effectively communicate and work as a team with employees and problem solve, my department was very understaffed, especially during busy hours and weekends, and the employees were too over-worked and stressed out. I have been a college student for a long time and I take school very seriously. I cannot work past 10PM on Sundays due to my school schedule. I felt as if I was forced to work over-time on Sundays due to the horrible under-staffing and lack of concern or communication from management. As a result, I began to fall behind in one of my classes. I held a meeting with my store manager twice about the problem with overtime on Sundays and the under-staffing, and felt most of my questions and concerns went unsolved. I resigned after the second meeting in order to improve my grade. Quitting my long-time employment at Walmart was a hard, painful decision, and a huge risk because I need a job to help pay for school, but after weighing the pros and cons of working at Walmart, the cons outweighed the pros.

The managers do not care if you are very Ill, saying because they make you stay out in the rain cleaning up after a bad storm and then make you go inside sopping wet to do more stocking, and then you catch pnemonia and they try to fire you because you have to take time off.

Some can be ok and understanding then there are others who let the position get to their head.

Challenging Job Atmosphere,"My position as Features Management Coordinator offers many challenges.  The position is about maintaining the endcap merchandise and the freestanding or ""PDQ"" merchandise.  I have to ensure that each of the 250+ in-store locations are current in the system.  I have brought our store's accuracy rate from the bottom of our market of 9 stores to the top. I have learned a lot about how Wal-mart handles their retail markets, their stocking patterns, and their various marketing approaches.  We have a very good management team at the store level but management is not good at all above our level.  My co-workers are one of the big pluses about working at this store.  We all get along and take care of each other.  The hardest part of the job is primarily due to being at half the average staffing level for a store of our size.  Depending on the position, an employee can be pulled to work many different jobs all day sometimes before they have finished the current job they are working on.  This fire brigade approach is tiring and demoralizing.  The most enjoyable part of my position is that I get to work alone with minimal supervision and establish the criteria whereby I am competing against myself to get my daily goals completed.

Reap what you sew except for the carrots...,"Hard work can pay off for you in the end with a company like Wal-Mart, but all too often will you find yourself being the work horse for your team or entire shift and the management is glad to abuse you for all that you are worth. Promotion is very possible and not entirely out of reach for those who walk in off the street to become a part of the company but take into consideration the area in which the store is located because customer interaction is a mandatory part of any retail job no matter what position you are hired in as. The key to working at Wal-Mart is ask a lot of questions so you can understand the big picture while you are still down in the ditches working. Solve the problems you see coming and don't be afraid to ask questions that may be outside of your pay grade. Ask your management team what their personal background is. The best managers you will find will be the ones who worked their way up through the company as an hourly associate. Best store manager I've ever worked for started out as a cart pusher.

There does tend to be a ""click"", which can be to ones demise if you are not part of it because moving up into positions isn't necessarily based on skill or being a great worker, it's who you know. Most all of the Assistant Managers; Tim, Alena, Travis, Tony, Trish, and Rick  are GREAT! I suppose the most difficult thing working there is the ever changing and rotating of Managers to different Departments each 6 months, because it seems that you just get used to the particular way a certain Manager wants his/her department to run and then here comes the 6 month change,but in todays world we have to embrace change.

Find another place to work,The benefits are not that bad compared to other companies but the compensation for working there is remarkably low. The culture and values of the company are only based on how the managers feel. They only care when regional or district managers are around. The advancement isn't bad at all didn't take long for me to get promoted but the job security is terrible. If you upset a manager you will quickly get fired. The management teams vary from store to store but they do need to work on weeding out all the bad apples.

It's a Job and it pays the bills. ,Come in do your job to the best of your ability with the tools proved. Some days it would be hard to get the tools to do your job. If you would go to a management to ask for the tools to do your job more then likely you would have to wait or go looking for to tools to do your job. The hardest part of the job would be the management team would give you different directions every time the right hand never knew what the left hand was doing.

Try to avoid working here,The only good thing about working here is the co-workers. Customers always made themselves feel that they were better than you and the majority of them are very rude! Management showed favortism when it came to promoting. If you are a part time associate you don't get dental which is a rip off considering Walmart is a muti-billion company!

"A job that's only temporary, especially in the Burlington, Iowa location","At first, it seemed like a great place to work, but I was deceived early on. A typical day at work would consist of getting returns, helping customers, use the register, stock shelves, bin overstock items in backroom, make labels for said binned items, labels for shelf items, rearranging end caps in the department and around it, helping nearby departments like Stationary, Fabrics, Pets, etc., doing projects for the managers, setting mods, zoning, and going through the ""rabbit cage."" The only thing I really like about this job, is the people I work with and helping customers. The most difficult thing about this job is not having enough associates working in the day. I do enjoy helping customers as much as I can, as long as they are not rude. At this job, the hours are not good with the work involved. They say there is always a way to advance in the company. I have tried and it's not as easy as they make it seem. In this job, there is only one day where the store is closed and that is Christmas day. So if looking for employment here, keep in mind that you will work ALL holidays and also are FORBIDDEN to ask off days in November and December because, and I quote, ""That is our busiest time of year."" _x000D_Some of the managers are decent but others have no idea what they are doing and I'm not sure how they became a manager. In one instance, I asked for a manager over the PA system. This one manager came over and I asked the question.

Fast-paced & lots of fun,My day to day routine varied depending on the shift worked. I would first open the register & start the coffee. I would then put up returns and freight for the day. Thoughout the day we would do process orders for tires & parts; cash out work orders; cash out customers for other transactions; make key copies; return/exchange batteries & keys; keep the automotive dept clean; and assist customers with their questions and concerns. At the end of the day we would make sure all work orders have been completed & cashed out. We would clean up & straighten the dept and then lock up._x000D_The hardest part about the job is when you have an irrate customer that you are unable to help whether due to their attitude or policies then when you call for management & they dont have your back by supporting you (this is all the time). Not all management was like this just a few. The best part of the job is when you have an irrate customer & although you might not be able to help them they leave with a smile because they know that you tried your best & went out your way for them.

Terrible management matches terrible pay.,"Walmart would not have been such a bad place to work at if it wasn't for the management. They seem to have a tendency to hire/promote the biggest a-holes in the industry. Favoritism is a major problem as well, as they seem to hire the ""pretty people"" instead of the ones who can actually do the job better. _x000D__x000D_As an Overnight Stocker, a typical day would start by punching in, getting a quick briefing on the stock today and what they want accomplished. Once done, we go off to our task manager to punch in what tasks we're getting started with. Typically, the task managers would want the associates to do 10+ hours of work in about 8 hours. Almost is it never completed fully, depending on what area you're working in. (Places like Pharmacy, Foods, and Stationary almost never get completed.)_x000D__x000D_New co-workers bring a fresh air to the team, but it's only a matter of a couple of weeks until their happy-go-lucky attitude is destroyed by managers. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you've done all this work and are never appreciated for it. _x000D__x000D_The only true enjoyment I had with this job was being able to help not only customers, but the people I worked with. Whenever I would be finished, I would always go to the areas that were hit the hardest with freight and help my co-workers. Of course I'd always make sure to see if it was okay with management. Just a simple ""Thanks"" or ""Thanks for the help man, you saved my butt"" always lifts my spirit. _x000D__x000D_Overall, Walmart is a terrible place to work.

The hardest part of my job was trying to figure out how to get everything done that I was responsible for and yet make the time to do the work of an associate as well because I had none.

In between we work on our tasks to be done. I prioritize my day to see that I can do the work to be done. Then when things come up I have that time to handle the constant changes. I communicate to management and associates on a regular basis. I also come up with ideas at work. I like to hear news ideas too. After all in a business world we have to adapt to costumer demands and employees can talk to management. I am quick to adapt and see problems that could come up. I also suggestive sell products and items for affordable budgets. Most of all I like our costumers who are friendly and like to come to the deli counter. My favorite part of the job is giving pieces of cheese to the kids. People know we care about them. We listen and give them what they want.

A typical day varied depending on where I worked at the time, but first and foremost it was always about the customer.  I learned about merchandising, ordering, mark-up percentages, and stocking.  I learned a lot about presentation and making things that may not sell immediately more appealing to the customer to get them moved out the door.  I learned the value of visuals.  I learned about inventory and sales.  Most of the management that I worked under was wonderful.  I liked having the respect of the managers and I liked that they felt comfortable relying on me.  The greatest part about my co-workers at Walmart was that we all took pride in our store.  We wanted the store to do well because it was a reflection of us and how hard we worked.

"Mindlessly unfullfilling, but a stable opportunity","Employment at the retail giant was neither fulfilling nor rewarding in a psycho-social sense, but it provided a level of stability and professionalism that are often missed in times of economic downturn. As a male cashier, I was susceptible to being thrown out into the hot or cold when the carts ran low or when the cart pusher decided to take an extended break or not show up to work. This was impaired by the sentencing to run the service desk when it got backed up or those employees took vacations._x000D__x000D_I learned a lot about the necessity of an education, seeing others much older without a higher level of education working for under the minimum wage, a testament to the length of time that they worked there._x000D__x000D_Management was vocal and responsive in many cases, but unless you were on their ""hit-list"" nothing amounted to much more than simply name-recognition and gossip.

It's a good starting point. But not a career.,"If you currently don't have a job, I'd recommend at least applying to Wal-Mart. They have decent scheduling capabilities and they're everywhere. I myself worked as an overnight stocker. I was easily making more money there at 20-30 hours a week than I have at any of my full time jobs elsewhere. Just beware, management under the ""Co-Manager"" Level are highly uneducated, and will more than likely create more problems then solve the ones you needed. This is not a job where you try to get to know everyone, it's a job where you show up, do your job, and keep your mouth shut most the time. Alot of people, especially overnight crews are going to try to gut you for hours so unless you knew them outside of work, best bet is to just work quickly, quietly and get paid.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker/Cashier ,"Oswego, IL",6/26/13,2013,6,26

The worst thing about the job is it's never enough help.

I don't necessarily bother me though. I just do not like the fact that workers are not appreciated for going outside their job codes so frequently. Also management seems to be on different pages.

"Ah, Walmart -- What Can I Say? ","Walmart is the icon of large corporate jobs.  It is a business that is out to make money, not to share it or give it away, and everything that the company does is geared toward that purpose.  There are, truly, good employment opportunities within the company if you are willing to make the personal sacrifices that the company demands of all it's employees.  You must be ready and willing to work when they want you to work, you must rarely need time off, you must be willing to work as hard as it takes to get the job done in the time provided though your hourly compensation will not reflect the amount of work that you do.  That is corporate retail life.  I was not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to rekindle my career in retail.  _x000D_My co-workers were wonderful.

They Don't Care About You ,"This is a company that makes billions of dollars a year and yet can barely give associates the tools necessary to complete their job. They do not hire enough people to work in these departments either. They've now combined many departments together to save on paying department managers. When I was hired in 2008 I worked in the Hardware department, that was it. Now I work in Hardware, Domestics, Housewares, and Furniture. I'm often asked to cover other departments like Sporting Goods because they won't hire enough coverage. Add that on to unloading trucks and having to help with carts and other odd jobs. They combined all of these departments and nobody was compensated fairly for the added work load and responsibility. Also, there is absolutely no accountability for work that is not done the right way. All complaints about these issues fall on def ears. I can accomplish a lot of work during the day and I don't mind a big work load. I like to stay busy but I also like to be compensated for extra work and more responsibility. It all comes down to Wal Mart cutting corners as they normally do to make extra money in spite of their associates. I work very hard there and I can't even get the highest pay raise every year of $.60 an hour. They'll say nobody can get it, and their reasoning, because you have to be pretty much perfect to get it. Though oddly enough my first pay raise was $.60 when I first started. So that's just them taking more money from people. So they can stuff the pockets of the suits working back in Bentonville. Yeah you can get quarterly bonuses, but the key word - more...",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Westminster, MD",6/23/13,2013,6,23

Loving people and productive workplace,"The people at Walmart are always looking out for your best interest, they're not there to be mean or anything. They want to work with your schedule because they value you as an employee. Being a Cashier is somewhat demanding as in you have to be able to stand behind the register hours at time, but you don't stay still for long, because if you're not checking out a customer you're zoning your lane, making sure it looks good for other customers. The coworkers always push you to do and be the best you can. Its easy to make friends with these people. I learned that having a job and balancing school activities isn't an easy task, I've learned from a couple of mistakes and grow from it.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Branson, MO",6/21/13,2013,6,21
Productive and fast pace environment,"Checking the t-mat to find out what department I would be working in. Then I would go over to that department and make sure nothing is on the floor or just hanging on the racks. Next I would fold up all the merchandise that was on a table or a wall and make sure it is well organized and presentable. Finally I would put away all the returns, and while doing all of this I would assist customers and other associates with any problems or concerns they may have. Some times I would go to the front end to help cashier if the store was busy. I would also work in jewelry if they were short handed. I learned more patience and how to open up to people. when it come to managers I learned that a lot of times you cant take what they say to heart  and if you have a question about anything the best thing to do is go to them and ask for help or for more information on what they want you to do. Most of my co-workers became a friend and even though I don't work there any more we still stay in contact and I make sure a see them any time I'm in the store. the hardest thing about the job was the no communication. one manager will tell everyone to do something one way then another manager would say do it different and everyone would be confused and when you tried to explain it to them or tell the manager what the other manager told you they wasn't trying to hear it. the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people making new friends. Helping people decide on things from what shirt they should get to if the pillows they are buying match the rest of the things.

Glad it was only a summer job,"I found that there was plenty of work to do at wal-mart. I was never bored during  my shift, and was given enough work.

Good management makes the difference.,"Wal-Mart is only as good as it's current management. The company can be both great to work for and very oppressive to work for. It all depends on the store, market, and regional management. Bad management will make your job hell on earth while good management will make your job very rewarding and a great place to have a career. One of Wal-Mart's goals is to profit through low wage expense. This is beginning to take a severe toll on the company as it runs it's self too short handed to take care of the customer or make the employees feel like they can accomplish their daily workload. If Wal-Mart wants to stay on top it will have to spend more on payroll and take better one on one care of it's employees.",3,Current Employee,Shift Manager ,MT,6/20/13,2013,6,20

Respect for Wal-Mart employees,"I have never seen such a great work force. The management and employees work so hard to make sure their work place is presentable to the customer. The down side to working at Wal-Mart is the ""standards."" Some of Wal-Mart's standards are impossible to meet and, at times, I was asked to work multiple jobs that were not part of my job description and barely gained any training with them. I worked overnight floor maintenance, which can be a dangerous job when you are asked to multi-task all over the store. To be fair to the Wal-Mart Company, I did work at one of their retail stores twice and I cannot say that all my decisions are made from one particular store, but I will say that they expect too much from their employees and push the managers too hard at times. At times, this Wal-Mart that I worked in was very chaotic and if you cannot keep up with the demands, you will fail to keep with Wal-Mart's standards. I cannot slander the Wal-Mart Company, but I will say that the commercials showing Wal-Mart employees happy all the time is misleading.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Floor Maintence ,"Athens, TX",6/20/13,2013,6,20
"Walmart's workplace is acceptable, I suppose. It isn't anything spectacular, and nothing really stands out to me.","   I work overnight at Walmart, so around the time I arrive, all the customers are being cleared out of the store. I store is quite messy at the end of the day. Given the location, it really isn't a surprise to me. The associates are quite outspoken and free spirited. There are some that are also quite rude and disrespectful also. Many associates do not have the great work ethic that you would expect but I just make sure I do My part and work from start to finish._x000D_   I sometimes question management and their poor management choices at times. They seem to be novices even though they have been managing for years. They are not the most observant and seem to put associates in certain positions that I clearly see would not work the best. I attempt to give a little advice, but they often deny it and do what they primarily chose. In these instances, there is really nothing I can do but watch as things go downhill, but I just make sure I do my duties, and do all I can to help others in their almost impossible tasks._x000D_   I tend to enjoy the company and short conversations I have with certain coworkers. Many are friendly and easy to talk to. I try to enjoy the positives things when I can. However, there are a couple coworkers that are nothing but frustration and a headache. Some are young, immature, and want to do nothing but ridicule, play, and joke around all shift. I attempt to try to ignore their immaturity but some things are just a little hard to ignore.

My co-workers were very polite and enthusiastic about being apart of Wal-Mart Inc. I have to say the hardest part for working at Wal-Mart was not receiving your breaks on time and the enjoyable part was that it has an eating area for you to buy lunch and you dont have to leave the premises.

As a cashier, the work was fast paced and enjoyable. Repetitive but enjoyable. The management was fine at this point. When I moved on to the sales floor however, things were different. My direct managers, the department manager and ZMS, were great. We worked great together. The assistant managers, however, were not the best. Eventually, my direct managers changed and the workflow was drastically changed. It all depends on who you work with.

They write employees up for looking at the clocks too much, not smiling enough, or clocking out a minute past the scheduled time even if it was because management ""asked"" you to stay over.

It's a busy place to work, a lot of things need to get done so you have to be very efficient at everything you do and a great multitasker if your up at service desk or supervising.  I'd start my morning off by punching in and going up front right away.  As a front end supervisor I have to make sure the cashiers that are scheduled are here and at the right register.  Anything a cashier needs, they type the code in at their own register (bathroom break, change, propane refill, training question, ect), and I would go get it or do it for them.  If the register lines get long, it is my job to find back up cashiers or if I’m able to, I hop on a register and help out.  I also work up at customer service a lot.  Any transaction that is done at the service desk, that is not a usual return, I have to be there and okay it by turning a key and typing in my password.  I do a lot of returns, counting money, cashing checks, cashiering, putting away returns, price checks, and making sure my lines don’t get too long.  I deal with a lot of customer issues, such as not being able to price match something or not being able to return an item.  Being courteous to the customer when telling them you are not able to do something is very important in my job.  You have to know how to talk to a customer and try to help them in any way you can so your able to fix their problem to the best of your ability or you have an upset customer.

Used to be great,"Generally you work with friendly people, that's where the fun ends though as after your training is complete you're basically their slaves.  They will look at every excuse they can to keep you as low on the food chain as possible and only the people that have been working there for 10 years + or the people who management likes will ever get a promotion.  As for a raise, I worked my butt off following all the rules and everything for a mere .40c after a year of busting my butt scrubbing their floors and toilets.  I trained new employee's, helped outside of my department, fixed their machines and took the time to help customers while still getting all of my work done.  They don't give good hours, they rarely give you the tools you need they're slow when they say they're going to do something and they give you an extreme workload and threaten you if you say you can't possibly complete it.

Our manager would work with us instead of sitting down or doing whatever, they would work with us to. They help solve problems before taking it to another level, like taking us to the bosses office. They helped us and teached us when we asked for help. My co-workers were nice and fun to work with, they also help rotate positions in our job or help you with that job.

The hardest part of the job is when customers pay with a combination of debit/credit card , coupons, cash and ebt card.

Walmart,"I enjoyed my time here. It was an overall decent environment. I learned a lot during my employment at Wal-Mart. I even walked away with a few good friends.

A good place if you need a job but a bad place to work,"The WalMart that I worked at was pretty stressful. They were understaffed and the staff that they had was overworked. You would constantly be pulled to other areas of the store to work that area but you would get into trouble for not finishing your area. Customers would complain about the lack of help they would receive and for the most part they were right. Training is done by CBL's (Computer Based learning) which we are required to complete but when you first start working there, there is not really any hands on training...it's basically learn as you go. In my opinion management was the crux of the problem. I found that their was a big gap in communication when it came to what management wanted done and what the workers were able to do. Sometimes we would not be able to perform certain tasks because we did not have the proper equipment. It's not that the equipment wasn't there it's just that it was not always readily available or it did not work. The hardest part of the job for me was the demandingness of it. I had no problem with doing the work that I was required to do, but what I had a problem with was being told by a manager to go to another area and work that area without full knowledge and ability to work that area efficiently and then getting into trouble with my manager for not being able to complete tasks in my area. This is where the lack of communication and employees came in. M favorite part of working at Walmart was without a doubt working with my colleagues.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Pensacola, FL",6/14/13,2013,6,14
.,Working for Walmart as a sales associate is demanding. I've learned customer service skills.

For example a rejection from insurance on their prescription. You have to find a way to explain why its not going to be ready and when and if it can be. It can get a little tricky sometime, but for the most part i can explain and or fix the problem so they can get their prescription or get a new one from the doctor.

They would each tell you to disregard the other managers and do what they told you to do. So you really needed to pick witch manager you wanted to not complete your work for today.

Most folks know that they hire people barely above minimum wage on a part time status so they don't have to offer you benefits. I can remember being sent home at 38 hours because I had accrued too many hours for the week so they wouldnt have to hire me full time. With all the money this giant makes, they should be ashamed not to share the wealth. This is why their associates don't show much enthusiasm for working there. This is why most of their associates have to apply for state benefit insurance in order to have any insurance.. This is why their customer service is downright awful. When you treat your associates well, they will generally take care of your customers. But I know walmart doesn't care, because they know that regardless of how customers are treated, they'll continue to shop walmart because generally the stores are a one-stop-shop and generally their prices beat their competitors.

I've seen mangers forced to step down afraid of termination and associates terminated for nothing.

Putting up re shops, zoning and cleaning the department, printing and flagging the department, and stocking the shelves with merchandise as well as covering my neighboring departments.  The most I learned was how to be good a customer service.  How to smile while someone is being very rude to you!  The management in my store on the shift I was on was fairly good!  The only problem was that they didn't make themselves readily available when called.  I was the only 2-11 associate in the toy department so I didn't have anyone with me, and most of the time there was no one in the 2 neighboring departments, so I was constantly called to cover them also.

Upper management was great, the department heads had a little abuse of power complexes. The co-workers were great people that had no problem switching a shift with you if something came up.

productive and fast pace environment ,"i would start my shift at 10P.M., usually this is a big shift change where all the cashiers and customer service supervisors would be leaving for the night. so i would have to hurry to the front-end to take over. Once we would get everything under control with the customers, and i have assigned all the cashiers there registers. i would start my nightly goals. this consisted of counting how many return carts where on the front-end and how many cashiers i had to split them evenly. after that i would have to count down the supervisors till to make sure that the money is at the exact amount that is set for us each night. then i would schedule out all the cashiers breaks and lunches based on who was at there registers first. management for the most part let me run the front-end however i wanted to, just as long as there weren't any extra things that needed to be taking care of for the store. i made sure that all of the cashiers that were under me were treated as a team and if that had any concerns they would come to me and ask and i would relate back to the managers if i didn't have an answer. the hardest part of the job usual only came during the first of the month, this is when we would have move customers than usual so sometimes it would be hard to take care of all of our other task because we had to take care of the customers. the most enjoyable part about Walmart was that there were often times where i got a chance to work in other areas beside the front end i like to switch up thing and learn something new.",4,Former Employee,Overnight Customer Service Manager/Cashier ,"Bedford, OH",6/10/13,2013,6,10

The most difficult part of the job was working in the back when the weather was to hot(in Hawaii).

However, they did provide manuals and a help hotline to help you out in most situations but sometimes troubleshooting problems with the machine could take hours even with the help of the hotline and while the machines were down you had to deal with unsatisfied customers. _x000D__x000D_Walmart also had a strict printing policy and sometimes we were simply unable to process orders due to the policy. This often aggravated customers. _x000D__x000D_I often felt like the management in my store in particular could have been more knowledgeable in my department. A lot of times I would come to them with problems that would require a manager and they had no solution which left me figuring out one for them. Also, when Walmart made the move to strictly digital printing the workload for my department was cut in half. The employee's in the department were often stuck figuring out solutions to pass time during dead hours. We usually did this by helping out other departments as we were told to - more...",4,Former Employee,Photo Specialist ,"Hayward, WI",6/8/13,2013,6,8

Great people to work with and I love the environment.,"Everyday at work, I am faced with challenges.  Sometimes it feels hopeless with all the work that needs to be done in an 8 hour period.  I always try my best and ask for help when I do need it.  The managers and other salaried co workers always have the answers that I need when I cant help the customer myself.  The work is hard work sometimes.  I do a lot of heavy lifting.  Which is hard on my back at times, but with the proper lifting skills and classes we take, it gets easier. I really do like my job, I'm just kind of looking for something more.",4,Current Employee,Fitting Room Associate ,"Mason City, IA",6/8/13,2013,6,8
"Large corporation, growth within the company, customer and coworker relationships","I've learned alot throughout my journey at wal-mart. When i applied, as a sophmore in college, i did not expect to learn and grow within the company. I've become extremely comfortable with customer service and I have matured through my  various change in positions. Everyday I clock-in and head to the pharmacy to fill prescriptions along with attend to paper work and insurance companies. I appreciate the promotion i was awarded for my hard work as a sporting goods sales associate. I genuinely enjoy seeing familiar faces and having a close relationship with my community of coworkers. Wal-mart is a very large corporation and i am proud to have been a part of it for the past three years.

It was as expected,In Wal-Mart you have to come to work with a solid focus on getting through the day.

NEVER worth it!,I worked at a Walmart for a total of three months. After working my hiney off for $7.45 a hour 35 hours a week and at the end of the pay period only made $399.00 NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE!!!!!!!!!!

"Productive, fun associates to work for, caring customers most of the time.","I loved meeting new people.  I acted as department manager for two weeks while they were trying to hire a new department manager. While I was working in the photo lab at Wal-Mart I learned all about cameras and their accessories and I also learned all about the equipment used to make pictures. I could usually fix the problem when we had one but if not I would get on the phone with Fuji technical support and they would talk me through how to do it. The hardest part of my job was telling people about the copyright law. Any professional picture could not be sold without a copyright release from the photographer. We had customers who didn't know the photographer, customers who were trying to get pictures together for funerals and that's all they could find, we had all kinds of customers and it was very hard to tell some of them they could not have their pictures. I enjoyed my customers the most. I loved helping people pick out the right camera that best fit them. I also loved helping them get their  pictures perfect by cropping them or whatever needed to be done. I was very honest with the customers and they all seem to like that a lot. Most people even thanked me for it because they didn't want to pay a lot of money for something if it wouldn't fit their needs.",5,Former Employee,Photo Center Specialist ,"Oxford, AL",6/7/13,2013,6,7

Overall typical department store experience,"I was hired for a cart attendant from the get-go. I was paid $7.90 hourly for the entirety of my employment. A typical workday for me was being outside and bringing in carts. Many days this was a task I had to do myself as call-outs were a common thing here. If it was too sunny or rainy I would have no coworkers and I would constantly have to pick up the work they would've done. This wouldn't have been a problem if I had the managers send out extra workers to help but this was not something that happened very much. Over the course of my employment I had at least 4 coworkers either get fired, quit, or transfer to another store/department because of various reasons. This was the hardest part of my job. Having to maintain a steady quota that was meant for more than one person. This meant that many times I had to stay later on my shifts to help out due to my ""perfection"" attitude. I eventually had to leave due to the dwindling condition of a family members health.

If you work four hours or more you are entitled to one fifteen minute break while if you work over 6 hours you are entitled to a fifteen minute break and a lunch.

It's not the same company as when I first started. ,"Too much micromanagement, each level of management wanted the work done their way without any consistency.

Combining departments to reduce the number of associates made areas to large to maintain. Overall the company is building stores faster than they are training good management.

Manager communication was terrible, the right hand never knew what the left was doing. You would waste time doing one thing and have to change it ten minutes later because another manager didn't like it. The problem seems to be in upper management, the assistants don't communicate at all. The co managers jump to conclusions before they get all the facts. And the store manager seems to hide behind two of the co's, letting them make most of the decisions for him.

Productive but does not pay much nor give enough hours,"The day is filled with greeting and serving the customers. Dealing with the co-workers was probably the hardest part of the job; they always talked about the next person and worried about nothing of their business. The management team did not communicate amongst each other which was another problem. Too many managers on the same shift and they all tried to be the chief. It was very unorganized. I didn't find any part of the job hard, but I think it could have been a little better if the managers actually communicated with one another. The problem was that they were all given assignments at the same time. A human is only one person. There is no way several orders could  be carried out at the same time. The most enjoyable part of working with Wal-Mart is working with the people. Maybe because  I am a people person. I found it easier to deal with the public instead of my co-workers including management. I enjoy meeting new and interesting people.

"I like the job, I enjoy the friendships made within the job.",In Wal-Mart you have to come to work with a solid focus on getting through the day. Make sure you aren't easily angered because the management's mindsets are not all on the same page. So what the actual procedures and rules are could be over rode at any moment. Just come to work with an open mind and the day will fly by. Making yourself smile is what it's all about. ,3,Current Employee,Customer Service Cashier ,"Manchester, CT",6/5/13,2013,6,5

A job were time went by fast,"When I  would first come in to work I would do a floor check to make sure there wasn't anything on the floor so customers wouldn't trip and fall. Then I would check to see if I had any returns in the front of the store and if I did I would put them back on the shelves. After that I would meet up with my manager and he would give me my tasks for the day such as stocking the shelves or doing little projects to make our department better. Since I worked in the toy department I always had to keep my department well organized because the children who came through would leave it like if it was their own room. That had to be the hardest part of my job because it was constant throughout the work day. Our main focus of the company was to make sure that our customer's satisfaction was always guaranteed, so whenever a customer needed my assistance I would put aside whatever it was that I was doing and make them my main priority.  My zone manager was very strict but she was also very work orientated and had a lot of knowledge about the company, I learned a ton about the company because of her which in turn taught me a bunch of shortcuts which made my job a little easier. My co-workers were very easy to get along with. I learned a lot of people skills with my time at Wal-Mart.

Very productive and great company to work for.,"Start off the day by unloading trucks that would pull in, in a timely manner stacking the merchandise on pallets then pulling the pallets out on the sales floor. If no trucks were in then we would go stock or fold close until we were done. I learned that working as a team that you can accomplish a lot.

Walmart is always busy. the management that I worked with some were awesome, understanding and dependable. Others were frustrated and under alot of pressure to satisfy the customers and trying to uphold Walmart's standards with a smile. I would recommend Walmart to anyone if they just needed a job and the money. You can move up and you are only gonna make good money if you are a manager. If you are a family oriented person, walmart is not for you because you will work every weekend unless you request off or call out. I hate to say it that way but thats the way it is unfortunately.

I had learned a lot at this company.  I am thankful for the opportunities I received.," A typical work day would be: work what ever job you were given,  do the best, and go above what my managers anticipated.  I had done a lot of different jobs at this company.  Mostly on third shift. I was a department manager for three years. In that time I was the top store in the district.  I have stocked shelves, inventory control, support manager, and unloaded trucks, Assistant managed in three stores, many times by myself.  There were clean-up crews, and new set-ups I was in charge of.  I've done accounting, customer service, scheduling and other HR duties.

Stocker," Overnight stockers at Wal-Mart essentially are responsible for helping to get the store prepared every night for the next morning's and day's customer. They process freight, create new displays on end caps and fill shelves with merchandise. They must stock this merchandise in a stable manner. After filling shelves with merchandise, they zone the store, which involves bringing stocked items forward so that shelves appear full and neat. They also ensure that individual items are in their correct locations. Wal-Mart overnight stockers can work in a variety of departments, such as in grocery, housewares or health and beauty aids. They additionally must answer questions from overnight customers and follow the company's ""10-foot rule,"" which requires associates to acknowledge and offer to help customers who are within 10 feet of them.

I like working at Wal-Mart because of the Customers. ,"I liked working there but I also did not.I loved checking people out on my lane because I am great at multitasking and I could be very polite and make small talk with them all at the same time ringing them up in a great timely manor.I was so great at checking customers up that they even referred me to be either in the express lanes or in the Customer Service desk.What I didnt like about this place was the Manager's they had there at the time.We were denied restroom breaks unless it was our break time.If we were busy we would go as far as 3 hours past our break time before we would get one.I also started to have medical issues at the time and I was calling in sick there for awhile and The doctors didnt know at the time what was wrong and Wal-Mart thought I was lying and just calling in just to do so.So they ended up firing me for missing to many days.I was an amazing worker for them.When it got busy on days they always would come to me to help at the check out lanes,or at the Customer service desk because I can be so polite and move quick all at the same time.I have never had any customers complain about me at any job.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service. ,"Warsaw, IN",6/3/13,2013,6,3

The management was very focused on their jobs as well as my co-workers(for the most part). The hardest part of my job was dealing with stubborn customers.

Very character building work place.,"Working at a company like Walmart really opens who you are and what skills you possess. You have to be very task oriented and have a well organized plan in your head when you start your day. You have to be able to sort out the necessary jobs that can wait a little and the jobs that are priority. You have to know how to handle customers and how to treat them even under the stress they may cause and how they may respond to you, especially when in a position of management. When in management you have to know what skills your associates have and give them tasks that they will be able to handle and that will work in the big picture of getting a job done, and what they may not be so skilled in, to help them grow and learn more in different areas. The best way to look at a job at Walmart even when in a management position is to keep learning and teach while getting your job done and done well in a timely manner.",4,Current Employee,Electronics Manager ,"Township of Howell, NJ",6/3/13,2013,6,3

Leadership,A typical day consists of about 13-14 hours.  There is usually 2-3 managers on my current overnight shift. My day starts with getting my freight unloaded and stocked in a timely mannner.  Getting the sales floor to look like grand opening by 7am.  The ability to multi task is not an option.  I still have to ensure that my sales floor is still productive as well as my cashiers and check outs.  My location is open for business 24 hours.  The customer doesn't care about the back of the building just their ability to find their merchandise and get checked out quickly.  But what goes on behind the scene is the only way to make that a pleasant experience.  I have about 30 to 45 minutes to access the store and plan out a shift. I have learned how to implement change and innovations within a fast growing company and changing economy.  I have learned how to get ordinary people to do extraordinary things.  My co-workers come from all walks of life.  Wal-mart is a true diverse and melting pot. The hardest part of the job is the high turnover and getting to know all of your people.

When I moved from my old state to Texas I had a job waiting for me because of their transfer process. For that I'm grateful, the best part of the job is the diverse work environment. The worst part is the scheduling  the company does make you work sporadic hours. The management at Walmart is dependent on the store just like in most retail; there are good managers and bad ones. On the other hand, I'm sure whatever store you work in that you will love your co-workers. People who work at Walmart might be some of the best people you will meet. _x000D__x000D_My typical day at work consisted of talking to customers and cashing them out at the end of their orders.

Fast Paced Retail Environment,"The company, overall, does a good job of taking care of it's Associates. The retail environment is fast-paced, and customer service can be very rewarding, but is often times very unforgiving. I held several positions from the sales floor to the back room, and even into management. The draw backs of such a fast-paced environment include the lack of true training and the lop-sided work/life balance of the salaried manager. The company promotes within, which creates an availability of upward motion for the career minded individual. And when the chips are down, this company does more than any other company I have ever seen to support Associates in need! The pay is competitive and the benefits are good.

Unwillingness to advance learning,"The salary management at Walmart 2088 does not push toward improving the livelihood of associates and themselves. They would rather deligate all responsibility toward asscoiates and middle management then to handle problems for themselves. The Job is enjoyable when managment goes above and beyond their title. I have learned that my team has to do extra work so the store will survive. Salary managers DO NOT work anything out of their job code and still recieve a huge bonus at the end of their fiscal year. While the lower tiers do extra work to imporve the store and a not guarenteed a bonus. Average bonus for a associate per quarter if budget calls for it is 300 dollars. Average bonus for an assistant manager 10k. while store manager is about 60k. That is a rough estimate. But they do not have to do extra work to get it. The store is so short staffed that not all areas are have any associates and on top of that they continue to cut hours on associates even though all overhead is not even close to being filled.

There are benefits and the pay is ok but you only get a raise once a year and its judged on your evaluation. But on average its small increments so you wont see your worth in pay unless you move up in the company. You're pretty much expected to work holidays. ,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Atlanta, GA",5/30/13,2013,5,30

wal mart managemenet,"a typical day at work means managing around 100 different associates and ensuring thousands of customers are taken care of. the hardest part of the job is the hours that walmart demands their salaried assistant managers work. i have averaged 60+ hours a week for the past 2 years. walmart claims to offer managers a 3 day on 3 day off schedule, 12 hour days, but i rarely have seen the 3rd day. my normal week sees me working 4 on 2 off or 5 on 1 off. the best part of the job is the benefits. walmart offers great health and 401k",3,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,tx,5/29/13,2013,5,29

It was a fun place to work,It was a fun place to work. I believe there are to many managers giving direction to associates but not talking with each other before giving them.

Stressful and demanding,"I Clock in; called to register because there are not enough cashiers, customers stop you wanting to know where things are in the store and can you find them something or show them where it is and then a member of management comes along and reprimands you because your work is not done in your department. Management tells you that to go on break you must find someone to watch your department for you and then find a manager and tell them you are going on break or lunch and there is no telling where they are located at.  Then an assistant manager tells you that you are not doing things the Wal-mart way, they tell you they are going to write you up, that you are not telling the truth and it is very stressful. Not all of the managers are that way but the majority are. Then there is the equipment, it takes a couple of minutes to measure, cut and fold a yard of cloth but it can take up to 30 minutes to print a ticket for the item because the scanner can't find the printer. I have learned that management feel they have to bully people to get the work done, my co-workers are just as stressed as I am and the hardest part of my job is not knowing what I will be doing once I slide my time card and clock in. Cleaning, stocking, zoning or cashiering or zoning some other department. There is no structure, and not enough employees for the work load. The most enjoyable part of my job is when someone(customer) says thank you for helping me and it makes it a little more bearable to come back on my next shift and do it all over again.",1,Current Employee,Fabrics and Crafts Sales Associate and Cashier ,"Kansas City, MO",5/29/13,2013,5,29

Workplace,A typical day at work was peaceful from the actual store. We work in a small office away from the store. It is a constant work flow and it was a joy to work there. The hardest part working here was you as a person had no life outside of the job meaning you cant take off or be late extendly.,5,Former Employee,Accounting Clerk ,"Marrero, LA",5/28/13,2013,5,28
The amount of work is ceaseless and accomplishments unnoticed.,"There is no typical day at work for the random needs of the customers. I learned how to mix paint, create copies of keys, run cashier, operate the phone, navigate their hand held terminal, help train other employee, and manage broken watches or jewelry that had to be sent away. Management hasn't made notice of efforts, and state I needed improvement, disregarding my evidence of work ethic. And so I felt unappreciated. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who were inconsolable, to the extent of taking their personal problems out on me, even after listening and apologizing for their bad experiences.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lynwood Center, WA",5/28/13,2013,5,28

great co-workers,A typical day for me is helping out customers and providing service as needed in a timely manner. I learned how to change oil and replace tires and also patch tires if reparable. I rarely come in contact with the managers but if I do they are sometimes helpful. I get along well with all of my co-workers. I respect everyone and we all are very helpful to each other. I would say the hardest part of my job is when I am unable to help someone out that is in need of service.

This is my only dislike about the company.

Fast paced end exciting environment,"A typical day at work would be overseeing the cashiers on the front end and at the service desk. This includes giving change, doing price checks, and taking care of any customer conflicts. I learn that each day can bring unexpected challenges, for example when we are short handed and don't have enough help. This changes the whole day because now I have to still provide service as if all the cashiers were accounted for. My co-workers are what make my job more enjoyable and keep me in high spirits when I am at work. The hardest part of the job is not having enough help and lack of support from management. The most enjoyable part of the job is service to my customers. If I can help someone out to make their shopping experience more enjoyable then I will do that. Hearing someone say thank you means that I did my job. ",3,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Hadley, MA",5/28/13,2013,5,28

Ok,"Working on ICS was good, good job security and responsibility but when I went to Sporting Goods at another store it only lasted about 2 weeks in before I got coached for something that was not even my area, then I noticed how sloppy the management was and how they like to have power trips where they order you around like your a slave and they will stand around and talk but the second you talk to another employee they snap at you. One thing I also hated was that they liked to multitask everyone so to get out of hiring a cart person they would call the male and ONLY the male associates on the floor to come get them instead of having one of the cashiers that wasn't busy going to get them. If me or a coworker was called we would have to come all the way from the back corner of the store, leaving our area without anyone to help customers which customers did not like one bit. I was happy to help but after about a month or two they started doing it all the time and I felt they did it just to get out of having to do it themselves and it also takes me or another associate away from their job which hurts customer service. When I expressed my concerns to management it was met with no action._x000D__x000D_There was clear favoritism at that store. I liked what I did there though and for the most part the people that frequented the store weren't rude.

Customers are mindless simpletons, and there is only a 10% discount on certain items. If you become a CSM, you basically become a department manager, cashier, service desk associate, cart pusher, sales associate, zone supervisor, unloader, and so on for 9.00 an hour. Management has no idea how to speak to employees, and for the ones who do, they are preyed upon.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Birmingham, AL",5/23/13,2013,5,23

Associate,"I was a cashier, a inventory prep specialist, stocker, and sales associate.  I was full time, but now Wal-Mart only hires part time.  I knew how to order, price items, stock, how to read managerial reports, assist customers with items at other stores.  I injured myself on the job and was dismissed because of it.  I was called to assist unloading a truck, which I had experience with.  I was injured that night.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to complete assignments when working in every department of the store all at once.  It was a very stressful environment.

This company requires personable associates,"A typical day working for Wal-Mart stores includes managing monies, being courteous, helpful, flexible and efficient.

The management is not as involved with the associates especially since the associates are on the ""front line."" The co-workers on the front end maintain a rapport and work together to ensure proper protocol is adhered to and the customer is being serviced in a timely manner with minimal conflict. The hardest part of the job is the pay, we do so much, mentally, physically, we are helpers to parents that need assistance with their children (sometimes a child is crying, yet a small conversation, some directed attention calms them, allowing the parent to perform transaction accordingly. Also the reality of life some people are not happy, and for those you must grin and bear it. The most enjoyable aspect of this job is servicing those in need, satisfying a customer who just needs an ear ( while ringing merchandise I tend to be flexible, listen and work),  and making friends (the majority of friends are more than 50 +) that are glad to have me handling their purchases.",3,Current Employee,"Cashier, Toy Dept.

Too much favoritism,"When i first started working at walmart the management and everyone seemed to be in a good mood, we received reguloar bonuses. Our store manager then got promoted and the new manager was not as productive and rarely gave praise or awards when deserved. There then began to be a high ammount of favoritism. If you were just there to work, you were an outsider. Most managers claimed to be there for the job, yet they hung out with employees at bars and clubs on their days off.

I learned a lot of customer service here on top of what I already knew, also they basically cross train you in every department with in qualification. the management there is not really on top of things, like they don't know which battles to pick they are mostly younger with a few older managers they are set in there ways and wont mold to others, as I feel that managers and employees new or old need to mold to each other to make the company stronger as a whole, as there is no I in TEAM.

It is a great company,"Working at walmart you have to have patience, dedication, great customer service skills, knowledge and common sense. I normally start my day by signing out the keys, opening the department, turning the lights on, cleaning the desk, greet the first customer that comes into the door, check the stock room. If there is freight, work on it. If there is a customer that needs a work order I tend to them first. Find out what they need and write them a work order. My co-workers and I have to work together, I start the process by writing the customers work order the correct way and then that's when the technicians job comes into place. We all play a part in the customers happiness and satisfaction of our service. It all starts will a greeting and ends with a smile.

I am All about making a difference!!!,"A typical day at work, A customer comes in the store to order a double cheeseburger with no onions, obtain there order then gets mad at the cashier because the burger has pickles when she never asked for no pickles. But what I learned about that situation was you just has to remain calm and just complete everything over because when it comes to the place of business the customer is always right & no matter what you have to keep them satisfied. The management I always worked with I got to know because i'm an easy person to get  along with, I make it my habit to get to know everyone if I could. The same follows with my co-workers but no mistake about it when i'm working that's it i'm just working not fraternizing. The hardest part of the job is, ""well I really cant say as of now because usually if something is hard I find ways of working around it to make things smoother and easier.""

my time,"My time at Wal-Mart has been short compared to most of the people I work with. As a company, you get no time off for 6 months and that's just minimal sick leave. You have no benefits for a year. No vacation time till year 2 and unless you are in a high position, you are not guaranteed your hours. But based on your store, you can have lots of fun events.

Management at Walmart is pretty okay.  The management to will help out in departments and assist you with any problem you have.

I would just tell them to go to customer service and file a complaint....but when I was told I could have a permanent position they promised me a better position better pay did I get it?

Good Work Place. Bad Managers.,"As far as the work goes, it was pretty much simple. I loved working for walmart. Only problem i had was on night where we was short of staff, managers would take out that problem on you. They would threaten you by termination and put you on a set time whenever short of staff. The good managers told us do the best we can and they even got on the floor stocking with the associates. Another thing too if you dont read up on Wal-Mart, they would hiring you part-time with full-time hours and tell you your full-time, that way when it comes time to cut hours back they can easily cut yours back and when you complain about it, you cant do nothing about it. Plus you have to be working with them over a year to receive benefits, but only if ur full-time for a year. I done seen people had to work a whole year over again jus to get benefits.

My coworkers were nice, but my employers did not pay enough attention to the schedule, and did not care about the employees very much in my opinion. The most enjoyable part of that job was the paycheck at the end of every two week period.

the life at wal-mart,"When I worked for Wal-Mart I felt as though I always had to walk on egg shells.  There was poor communication between the members of management and the other crew members.  I was always told something different to do by both managers and when i didn't get something done the opposing member of management would be upset that I was unable to complete their task in the time given.  They have a bad habit of running the store on the smallest crew possible.  I found myself having to get very good at prioritizing things at the store.  The most important thing was to make sure that every customer was taken care of regardless of what other tasks I had on hand.  The most enjoyable thing about my nights at the store was that most of my co-workers were pleasant to be around and regardless of being physically and mentally drained we always were able to find a way to keep each other in positive spirits.

I am always watching my hours to make sure they don't short me (which happened 3 times and have only gotten 2 of them back through A LOT of time and effort) which should not be an issue no matter where you work. At every location you will have to deal with at least one or more (most is 3 assistant and 2 co-managers) that are completely incompetent.

"Always productive, nice benefits, and great learning experience. ","At Wal Mart everyday is busy and there isn't time for any mistakes. Filling three different positions since I worked there proved to be a rewarding experience. I learned to use lots of equipment I wouldn't have necessarily used anywhere else, became proficient in customer service, and learned to be a great leader. Management seemed to be at the top of everyone's dislike list. One out of nine managers seemed to be prepared to help anyone who needed help but other than that, it seemed as though they were always too stressed out to do anything or just didn't have time. There were too many managers giving orders that it would be no wonder that all employees were typically not doing normal procedures the correct way. Also, managers tend to hurry with the hiring process that they often hired uneducated people with no motivational skills or who just didn't care about Wal Mart in general. My co-workers were generally very nice people. Although, most of my co-workers were again, uneducated and had no motivational skills. I knew that about two third's of Wal Mart's employees would quit soon after being hired due to the amount of work that would be given to them. I'd say overall the co-workers were just uneducated enough to make Wal Mart a better and more profitable company. The hardest part of working at Wal Mart would have to be getting all your work done in a timely matter which, never happened.

When caught I would follow protocol and then be on my way. I learned many things here, cashiering, management and how to spot a shoplifter. The management here, for the most part, is great. When I had a problem it would be taken care of in a timely manner. My co-workers were also great. We all worked as a team and over time acted as a family.

Disrespectful and Ignorant,"I worked overnights on the floor stocking shelves. My first day on the job consisted of being handed equipment and told to do a job that I was unable to do, due to lack of training. The manager gave me no time to ask questions and disappeared. I spent nearly an hour trying to find him, only to find out he was asleep in the camera room. A coworker kindly helped me out. The breaks were probably the only thing I looked forward to at work, simply because a group of coworkers always brought cards or dominoes and that was what we spent our break time doing. The hardest aspect of that job was my constant fight with management, they had their minds set more on times rather than the health of our customers; I say this because after a few months working there, I was stocking groceries. Part of stocking groceries consisted of rotating the stock (placing the old stock in the front and the new stock in the back) I was disciplined multiple times because I refused to shove the old stock in the back just to make room for new stock. Despite multiple attempts to talk to the other managers, none of them really seemed to care about the situation. I was soon let go due to ""taking too long finishing my task"" because rotating the stock took too long. I would NEVER recommend anyone work at that Walmart again.",1,Former Employee,Shipping and Receiving Associate ,"Springfield, MA",5/11/13,2013,5,11
awful,"I hated working there. The management bullied me, I never got to spend any time with my family, they don't care if you are sick, they only let you have 3 sick days and if you take more you get in trouble, it's depressing, they don't treat everyone fairly (the management has favorites that can get away with almost anything), you do the same thing all day every day so it gets really boring, the stupid strict dress code, and I could go on forever. I absolutely hated working there. ",1,Current Employee,cashier ,"Saratoga Springs, utah",5/11/13,2013,5,11

It was a great place to start as a first job. Working there taught me the basics of customer service.,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is clocking in and going to the part of the store that you work in. You will have good customers and bad customers, that is with every business. I learned how to work a cash register, as this was my first job, and I learned how to work the customer service desk. The people above me were okay, when I first started they were all nice but after awhile, they started to show their true colors. I liked most of my coworkers;I am usually reserved but I could go to a fellow cashier and talk and joke around, I never had a problem with them. The hardest part of working here is that you have to have work whatever hours they give you, as there is no set schedule if you are an hourly worker.Also, the pay is very low, but since I do not have any bills, the paycheck is just fine to me.",2,Former Employee,SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Tulsa, OK",5/10/13,2013,5,10

Terrible place to work.,The management doesn't care about you or anything else.  They want you to be available 24/7 and then only give you 10 hours a week.

Overall walmart is a great company,I worked produce and back room freight unloader. Being taught the ins and outs of produce was awesome. There is a lot that goes into making sure the customer has the best product available to them and that its fresh and delightful. Co-workers were helpful and determined but otherwise were unhappy with their jobs due to poor management. Management seemed disorganized and would often have 3 managers telling 1 employee to do the job the way they each asked and then later would get upset at the employee for following another managers direction instead of their own. the hardest part of the job would definitely have to be repeating the same work you just finished because another manager wanted it a different way. The time wasted could've been spent with more pressing tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the satisfaction you could see on their faces after you helped them find what they needed. Customer satisfaction and safety are top priorities for any business. walmart definitely has a great understanding of those two values.,2,Former Employee,Temporary / Seasonal Positions ,"Modesto, CA",5/9/13,2013,5,9

"A simple job with nice people, but no room for advancement or better pay","A typical day at work would have me coming in bagging or laying out bread to be baked.

My department manager is really nice and always helps out when there is work that needs to be done. She is also very understanding and a great person to talk to. My co-workers are awesome, part of the reason being because it is such a laid back-but work hard atmosphere. The hardest part of my job is smelling the bread. As silly as it may sound the smell makes me nauseous, and sometimes I can not take it because it literally makes me sick. On the other hand, the part I love most about my job is when I am able to let my creative juices flow and decorate some cakes, because I think I am pretty good at it.

Completely removed from Sam Walton's Original Idea,"This is my second time in employed at Walmart. The 1st time Sam Walton was alive and so were his ideals. . . everyday people given the opportunity to advance regardless of educational background. A family oriented community fully supportive of each other. Now however, I equate Walmart to ""Modern Day Slavery."" The amount they pay and the expectations of the job are horribly unmatched. Years ago my starting pay was $10 an hour in 5/12 they started us at $8.40 and now they start overnight associates at$8.20._x000D_They have this ""Task system"" in which some moron in corporate tells you how long it will take you to stock your area. These times can not be met so fearing losing their jobs most employees overstock and wrongly stock shelves. These times are suppose to tell management how many people are needed inn an area as well. However, even though we are only on the sales floor six and a half hours if the ""task"" time equals 11hours they expect one person to finish the job. _x000D_Management use fear of losing your job to control employees and a host of inappropriate behaviors and actions occur from assistant managers sleeping with underlings to managers and employees being high and under the influence at work, The older employees are the only bright light. They try to keep the ""family"" atmosphere and stand strong because the majority of their training was under the original ideas.  Its not Sam Walton's Walmart anymore. . . .",2,Current Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Richmond, VA",5/8/13,2013,5,8

Productive workplace that involved quick thinking and customer service.,"During a normal work day, I work with a team of unloaders to try and get trucks unloaded quickly as well as safely. After our first break we continue working in the back to make sure everything is ready to take freight out to the sales floor, including working in the back of the Grocery department downstacking pallats in order to take groceries to the sales floor.

Wal*Mart is a very fun place to work and learn skills needed to excel.,"Customer service skills a plus in any position. I was hired as an overnight cashier and through the 10.5 years at this job I have learned many skills. Being patient, customer service, stocking shelves, rotation, time management, running a register, teamwork, and computer skills. Management was easy to get along with, the only issue is there is quite a few management staff and not enough associates to cover the work that needs to be done. All my coworkers were fun and easy to work with. Hardest part of job is getting used to using the Gemini's for everything that is necessary to get the job done.

Then i usually take care of insurance problems input and fill prescriptions for the day. The most enjoyed part of my day comes by just talking with the people i have an every day relationship with and who i know on a first name basis,which is the customer. The worst part of my job is the management, it's horrible and they don't understand the needs or concerns of the pharmacy(being that it's retail and the managers for us are the ones for the whole store).

Not a Favorite," A typical work day at this particular store would include management speaking to the ones he/she likes rather than speaking to everyone. The associates however are friendly and very considerate. I learned a few things working at Walmart, being below management means you don't have a voice and you will have to do what management tells you in order to keep your underpaying job. Moving up in the company would mean to bow down and tell on each other to get ahead. And also, working as a team can mean doing all the work and ""the favorites"" reap the benefits. My co-workers can be just as crude as the management team, overall my co-workers seem to realize we're all in the same boat. The hardest part of the job would be to consistantly deal with management not providing everyone with professionalism roles and treating everyone equally.

From my experience at Walmart, I have learned how to manage multiple tasks and work with management and my co-workers in a cooperative environment.

Management were always happy to work with me if I needed help with any procedures, and the co-workers liked to have fun while lifting boxes and moving merchandise.

My management staff as lacking here and there, not just my department, had their quarks, but worked well together with each other.  My co-workers are awesome, talk about a family environment.  In the little time with Wal-Mart, I knew associates and kin to them.  Like Networking in the business world, except on a more personal scale.  That was easily the more enjoyable part of the job.  The hardest part of my job was being pulled from my department and going to another department.  I was trained in my department, so going to a new department (to cover a lunch, or break, or to cover until someone comes in) wasn't easy at first.

I stock mainly the dairy area (juice, milk, cheese, yogurt, and sometimes meat). My co-worker are cool but most of them are immature and I need to be in a more mature environment. Management is up and down sometimes. The managers think we are slacking but they never see how hard we actually work. I can describe them as presumptuous and outspoken at times. The hardest part of the job the time frame sometime. 18hrs or 12hrs worth of work seem easy with two people but all the moving, down stacking, and transporting other department items is time consuming. The things I enjoy the most is the making custumers smile when you speak, help, or just being nice to them. ",3,Current Employee,NIGHT STOCKER ,"Mt. Pleasant, SC",5/2/13,2013,5,2

The only problem was not having enough coverage in all area of the store. The management could have done better with scheduling. The typical day at work, was making sure all the customers were taken care of in a timely manner, and making sure that merchandise was fully stocked. I learned to deal with all sorts of customers. I also learned how to sell wireless phones, which was a great experience. The co-workers that I worked with were always nice, and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was making sure the customer left happy, if the customer did not leave happy, that would make their shopping experience a bad one.

Managers were caring but firm and tried to help their employees as best they could. In my expirience, my co-workers were friendly and fun, however still professional.

I also learned skills in the back room, such as palletising and over head stock. I learned order tracking and useful skills for other jobs, such as hardware related skills. So I can honestly say there is a lot of learned growth in the job. It is very learn by fire there. They want you to learn quickly and on the job, so while you may not get tons of prior learning time, there are lots of associates there to teach you. My co workers were wonderful and they are some of the nicest people I have ever worked with. there was a great sense of comradery amongst us, and I grew as a worker from it. Management could use a little work, and there was definitely room for improvement on the way it can go depending on the store, but all in all I had great direct managers, who tried to work with me and my other associates to run our section as smoothly as possible. If there were issues I felt comfortable enough to go to someone about said issue. My hardest part at times were the pressure and the pace of certain projects when we had not enough associates to accomplish all the tasks. But not to the point of being unable to perform my duties. My most enjoyable part would have to be dealing with the customers and selling the product. I greatly enjoy sales and I love teaching customers about what they are buying. I love hearing their stories and trying to tailor their purchases to their direct needs. it made me feel like I was assisting them in more than a purchase, but in their choices - more...",4,Former Employee,Electronics sales Associate ,"Warwick, RI",5/2/13,2013,5,2

The co-owner was rude & had an attitude like he didn't like his job or he didn't want to come to work, or had family issues, like he was in desperate need of psychological help! I'm sorry but the work environment made me feel like they didn't care about employees just that you show up for work. I voluntarily walked out because I felt there was no team support. The employees roamed around a lot, sucks when you dedicate your time & show effort but not recognized except when they feel the need to explode on you. Then, I was called in to the office w/o a reason where I was asked questions about the co-owner! All they gave me was my name was mentioned & just had questions to answer. Never knew what that was all about. Thinking & feeling like I did something bad, I just walked out before they considered firing me; lot of miscommunication!

"Many nice people, but dont take workforce very serious","A typical day at work i come it at 4:00 PM and we get the backroom set up to unload the General Merchandise truck. we pull pallets out of the backroom and then set empty pallets down nicely to stack the freight neatly on them. We make sure the back room is clean and work safe. we unload how ever many trucks there are then make sure everything is separated. then go to lunch come back and pull all pallets to the floor for graveyard stockers to stock. After we pull all pallets we will do inventory control in back room such as picks, audits, bin audits, etc... After we finish that up we clean backroom and get any pallets down from upper steel to pull to floor. i have learned a lot of work ethics, inventory control, management skills, how retail runs. Management at Wal-Mart are quite unfair and absolutely dont take work serious enough in my opinion and they don't work as hard as they should as well, this is one reason i want to move up and work hard and get better pay to take care of my family. Most of my co-workers are wonderful people they work very hard and have a lot of potential to do great things. The hardest part of the job is being in the middle of mornings management and graveyards management, one will tell us one thing and the other will tell us something completely different they don't stay in contact which leads us to getting in trouble.

one big popularity contest,"If you're not well connected you really don't matter. Supervisors lie and hide. I once came in to clean the bathrooms and there was blood, tissue everywhere, defacation smeared on the walls, & over flowing garbage. I asked the managers who checked behind the last shift and no one knew who was supposed to. The next day I was written up for paper being on the floor even though it was clean. They force you to use defective equipment that is at least 13 years old. I have high blood pressure and need the health insurance but they hire everyone part time to avoid that. They schedule you for short shifts and expect you to finish EVERYTHING in time regardless of how many people are there or how much work it is. You are asked to work overtime and then asked to clock in late or take 30 minute lunches to give them back their time. If you dont you get written up for stealing time. This is modern day slavery.

I felt that this kind of job is not really for anyone looking to advance unless you want to bend over backwards for some people. Their advancement system is based on a computer system that takes account of performance evaluations, how many days youve missed and wheter or not youve been late.

Too much work for too little pay.,"A typical day as a sales associate is pretty boring: you check the inventory, restock what's missing if you can, then spend the rest of your shift zoning, i.e. tidying things up after customers have come through your department and disorganized things. If you're lucky, you'll have a co-worker on duty with you; the co-workers are often the best part of the job.... Unless they're incompetent. But, most of the co-workers I ever had were great. The managers... not as much. Department heads generally knew their stuff, but the assistant managers, by and large, seem to have no idea what it's like to work on the sales floor, and thus will sometimes assign ridiculous tasks. But really, the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. The customers are generally disrespectful, dismissive, or outright rude most of the time, and you the employee are forced to smile and suck it up. This is probably true of any job, but I'd say it's worse at Wal-Mart than at other places. And really, they don't pay enough or give good enough hours to make it worth the hard work you often have to do, like moving huge piles of freight or enormous boxes by yourself, while dealing with perpetually unpleasant customers.

Push to the limits to be the best,"In unloading we clocked in at 4pm and left and 1am. The work was hard the fright boxes were often broken or covered in bleach, bags of cat and dog food would be ripped open and poring everywhere, and yet we managed to get the whole truck (often 2000 boxes) unloaded within 2 hours. We brought all the new and overstock fright to the sells floor so the overnight stockers can do their jobs. After, we maintained the overstock by doing system generated ""picks"" and unloaded additional trucks. The hardest part of the job was being the person inside the truck placing the boxes on the rollers at a minimum pace of 1000 boxes an hour. The rest of the team had to sort these boxes by department as the freight moved down the rollers. The co-workers were fun to work with and we always shared a laugh after the hard work was done.

The essential part of the job was self explanatory, but I was shown their labeling method to more easily locate where products belong.The multi-tiered management system meant getting several assignments that were often in conflict. A manager being in the area most often meant being either reassigned or audited. But they were conspicuously absent if any problems arose from obeying their directives.I was mostly assigned to be on my own, but the times I had a coworker with me went well, it was usually to show them where things were meant to go.The hardest thing were the mandatory breaks, and getting in trouble for working off the clock.

However, management is very tough. There is a lot of negativity from the managers and almost no praise for doing a good job. We always have the negatives brought to our attention and rarely do we get praise for a hard days work or even if we perform above and beyond what is expected of us. The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge of finding the products customers order. I always strive for excellence and 100% on my scores. The customer is the most important part of what I do, and making the customer 110% happy is my goal everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job is challenging myself to do more everyday.

Little did i know, they had me scheduled for work during my class hours so it was either skip class or skip work. I told the Human Resources and Manager and both were non-sympathetic to my ordeal. I got numerous call ins and in trouble both at work and at school. I failed a good majority of my classes as a result and after 1 month of being out of college they let me go from my job.

A fast pace business that can get boring at times when business is slow.,"A typical day at Walmart starts off slow from around midnight to 9:30am, so an employee is able to restock grocery bags, empty trash cans, clean the register and belt, and do re-shop on items that don't belong in a particular area, as well as assist customers when its slow and busy. I learned the various vegetable and fruit codes, so that i could move at a faster pace and be able to move my line of customers along faster.

"not a bad job, just limited communication between managers","I worked overnight stocking groceries, the first couple of weeks were difficult because I had just been cleared to work by my doctor for breaking my arm in half, and got some metal plates installed. The work is a bit physical but easily manageable if your in decent shape.Every night starts out with a group meeting, (kind of lame, but it does let you know your workload for the night, and you ""stretch"") then its off to the backroom where you either unload the trucks if am shift was busy, or move your carts out to aisles and stock the aisle your assigned in. It was pretty nice because overnight there's not a whole lot going on normally, maybe a few customers to help, but for the most part its just stock your goods, rotating stock, taking overstock to the back when your done. Aside from my managers telling me one thing, then another, then management changing and having to learn the new mangers b/s, it was a pretty good job.",3,Former Employee,Overnight Grocery Stocker ,"Billings, MT",4/22/13,2013,4,22

"Fun place to work,enjoyed it,","Busy,enjoyed working and interacting with patients and other healthcare professionals,learned the major difference between retail and hospital pharmacy practice,the practice of pharmacy from a pharmacist point of view is quite different from the practice of pharmacy from that of a non pharmacist or a learning pharmacist in management.My co-workers were very cooperative.The hardest part of the job was focusing on what management expected.I enjoy practicing pharmacy overall,no specific part of the job whether retail or hospital",4,Former Employee,STAFF PHARMACIST ,"Quincy, FL",4/22/13,2013,4,22
Great place to provide awesome customer service.,Enjoyed working at Wal-Mart making all customers feel welcome. I also received cross training and was trusted to test as a pharmacy cashier.

It's Walmart - you can only expect so much.,"Gone are the days of Sam Walton whose philosophy was ""Listen to your employees."" Walmart has long-gone corporate and is focused on the bottom line. Employees are hired part-time at minimum wage for a particular pay grade, and if you switch to a lower pay grade it's classified as a demotion. Forget benefits, unless you're one of the rare people to obtain full-time employment. Pay raises are given about $.15 at a time. The store I worked at was pretty good, and I enjoyed my job, but I felt no potential for advancement. And from what I saw about how they worked management like a dog, I had no desire to advance. The stores are LOUD and the noise gets to you after awhile. They will do anything they can to get out of paying workman's comp. Even if it's only a doctor's office visit. The moral is, don't slip and fall at work, ever. The hardest part of the job was listening to co-workers complain & gossip. I'd come in happy and leave disgusted. Also, it was extremely FRUSTRATING to go through all of the required computerized orientation material (and stay awake) only to have floor supervisors and managers completely contradict the training and chew you out for following it rather than the local store unwritten rules.",3,Former Employee,"OPTICIAN, CASHIER ","Appleton, WI",4/22/13,2013,4,22
Horrible Place To Work For,"There was always nonstop criticism towards the Hispanic members. The high school branch manager does not know how to at least wait until the door closes to talk bad about the last person who was just in the office. She was VERY immature. The supervisors there were extremely hypocritical. There was always so much drama in the workplace. When you try to keep to yourself and stay out of trouble, you end up getting into trouble for not associating with anyone. There was no pleasing anyone there. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to leave that place. Supposedly we were allowed two 15-minute breaks, but I couldn't even be gone 5 minutes, and they'd already be looking for me even when I was trying to take a restroom break. How ridiculous was that?

Productive workplace sometimes overwhelmining,"There were no typical days at Wal-Mart. Everyday was different whether pleasant or unpleasant. I overseed 5 department managers over the fresh areas. I learned about inventory on fresh foods such as meat, dairy, bakery, and deli. It was not a difficult job but due to the lack of sales floor employees, the job was bit overwhelming. I am a very flexible person but doing 5 peoples jobs everyday will take a toll on your body. The hardest part of the job was trying to be so many places at once because everyone always needed help.

Its okay as a starter job but dont stay too long,I've been there 2 and a half years now and I work my butt off for these people and I don't feel they appreciate it. Going into the pharmacy I was told I would be made into a pharmacy technician after a little while and once the manager left the new person that took her place had no interest in making me a tech even though I pretty much do everything a technician does. I'm tired of being under appreciated.

"A busy, thriving pharmacy environment","Wal-mart pharmacy was very busy, with lots of opportunity to interact with patients. The computer system was excellent, being both powerful and user-friendly. It was easy to find information I needed. I learned how to deal with patients in a high-stress environment. I also learned about how to follow safety protocols despite pressure to fill prescriptions faster.My interactions with Wal-mart management varied from region to region but were generally positive. They were willing to look out for me and help me become an intern and work around my college classes.The hardest parts of this job were working under time pressure, and dealing with some interpersonal drama. I learned that when dealing with other pharmacy staff, I need to be more socially and personally open instead of remaining professional and distant; however, my personal problems need to be reserved for non-working hours.The best parts of the job were feeling like I had helped a patient get their medication more easily or affordably. I loved counseling on OTC products, and working with the insurance companies to get medications covered. Sometimes I would uncover a hidden problem in a patient's prescription, or in how the pharmacy had filled it or was being reimbursed, and solving it was always fun. I also enjoyed seeing the new systems Wal-mart is implimenting to make logging prescription hardcopies easier.",5,Current Employee,Intern Pharmacist ,"Warrenton, VA",4/22/13,2013,4,22

Intresting days.,"Working at walmart has shown me what customer service can be. I have learned to juggle over four departments in one day, from working in lawn and garden to cutting fabric.

The managment can be fair at times, then completely over demanding. My co-workers were the majority of the reason I enjoyed coming to work. The hardest part is the fact that the job is never ending, but it keeps you busy and time flies right on by.

"I am a friendly, reliable, and kind employee and would love to work at your distribution center.","Walmart is a very productive company with a lot of emphasis on Customer courtesy. In my last 4 years of service, the management teams have been very respectful and kind to all employees and never hesitate to let us know that we are doing a good job with an occasional thank you, which means a lot. I have always gotten along well with co-workers, both male and female. The hardest part about my job at Walmart is having to work a lot of weekends. The most enjoyable part of my job is the contact with the customers and doing what I can to help them. I love people. What I have learned by working with the public everyday is: Treat people like you would like to be treated. Customers can be rude and make you feel bad sometimes. Always have a smile on your face because even the rudest people can become friendly when your nice to them and you can make a big difference in their day just by being kind. I'm a positive person and I don't care to complain and be negative against the company I work for as every company will always have room for improvement and I believe they try everyday to improve in the quality of their business and their employees.",5,Current Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Bristol, PA",4/21/13,2013,4,21

fun and interesting,would got to work and perform duties for that day but more than half the time had to work overtime because the managers would always want me personally to go help in a different department. i learned a lot of things and i am pretty confident that one day i can become a manager at a company the hardest part of my job would have to be that the pay wasnt all that great for all the work i was doing. and the most enjoyable part was that it was walmart so there was always some kind of drama happening as far as with the customers people going in and trying to steal things from the store.,4,Former Employee,overnight stocker ,"Houston, TX",4/21/13,2013,4,21

Great place to start out.,"If you are looking for a job that will teach you patience and problem solving this is a great place to start. Management is easy to talk to and express your concerns in a professional manner. Customer Service at walmart is a lot difficult than most would image. Usually an eight hour shift always consists of customers at their breaking point, supervisors at their breaking point, too many customers in a line, not enough help staffed, and Lots of returns and exchanges! It's very hectic and sometimes overwhelming. Our customer service supervisors are friendly but they tend to go against policy to make disgruntled customers happy, unfortunately giving the customer the idea that customer service associates are not willing to help. My associates are amazing! Since day one if I ever had any questions about anything they are always willing to teach me so that I can learn. The number one thing that I have to admit that I love about the job is when I can help a customer successfully. It's such a great feeling to be handed a problem and having the ability to come to an agreement and understanding about how to solve it.",2,Current Employee,Customer Service ,"Indianland, SC",4/21/13,2013,4,21
interesting place to work,I made a lot of friends at this job. All the employees were like family. I got to help customers and visit with customers.

Good experience ruined by one dirty supervisor and her friend,"Starting I received almost now training, and was thrown at the sales floor, customer service managers(supervisor to cashier) were nice and hard working seeming to care about the customer.After a while and what I believe is result of my mistaking my supervisor to be pregnant I was given an instructing, upon following that instruction another csm(good friends with the csm who instructed me) wrote me up for disregarding her instruction and obeying the first supervisor, in attempting to reason with management I was labeled a liar and the two sided against me.I do not believe there is an ""Open Door Policy"" at walmart, upon attempting I was given the run around and refered back to human resources, who sided with both supervisors words against my word.Sadly I was labeled a liar and terminated, upon appealing to my first supervisor on a personal visit, she told me something I can not repeat here(to stay professional) and called security claiming I was harassing employees.Aside from these two customer service managers, I think walmart is an excellent place to work and miss my employment there, it was a fun and involving experience from which I learned much.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Surprise, AZ",4/21/13,2013,4,21
Not for everyone.,"A typical day at work involved cashiering, restocking, and customer service. I learned a lot about being patient and trying not to take things personally (you deal with a lot of angry people being a cashier at Walmart). It really helped develop my patience and my backbone when dealing with stressful situations. Management was so-so, they would forget my breaks now and then, and demanded a lot of hours out of you (which makes you tired and stressed all the time). My co-workers were friendly, and I made a lot of friends when I worked at Walmart. The hardest part of the job was how demanding and stressful it could be. The best part was meeting so many different people, and becoming close friends with your co-workers.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Wilmington, DE",4/21/13,2013,4,21

A great first job for high school kids.,Typical day is scanning freight in & out of the bins to and from the sales floor on 3rd shift.The thing I have learned most by working here is that it is one of the toughest and lowest paying jobs one can find. The negative feedback you get on the job has to be the worst I have ever encountered.The managers are pretty much those who have been promoted from within with very little experience and have never worked as a manager in any other type of business.I have found most of my co-workers ro be enjoyable to work with.Hardest part of the job is listening to managers constantly degrade you for not accomplishing work that is impossible to complete within an 8 hour day.Most enjoyable part of working there is when its time to punch the clock & leave.

Fast paced and new added tasks everyday,"First, I begin to unload pallets of new merchandise, which can range from one box up to 70+. Organize all of the new and old merchandise on the floor, to make it presentable for the customers. I walk the layout of my Women's Apparel to check if there are any missing labels, signs, and tags. I complete my BAM (Be A Merchant) screen, which consists of price changes, price overrides, and not on files. I also complete my counts, which I have to research my items that are displaying an inaccurate number. All of the actions are being completed while I assist the customers/shoppers that come in to the store. My supervisor comes to observe and ask questions on certain items, as well as providing me a list of to-do's for that day. If I come across a new idea, I immediately bring it to their attention to receive an approval so I can execute my plan. Ninety-eight percent of the time I am approved. My sales increase and I am pleased. My co-workers and I assist each other in difficult tasks, that cannot be conducted alone. For example, the team lift, is when an item is over fifty pounds and must have two people to lift, to prevent injury. The hardest part of the job, is while I am conducting my duties, I will witness a shopper stealing, so I contact the lost prevention people, to assist with the observation. Now when the shopper runs out of the store, I have to help the lost prevention people stop them, which is a very dangerous position to be in. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I tackle all of my tasks, as well as my to-do's for the the day, and still have time to change the - more...",4,Current Employee,Merchandise Supervisor ,"Greensboro, NC",4/21/13,2013,4,21

My co-worker and I got along great we would split up jobs to do so we would be able to get our work done before the end of the work day. The hardest part of the job was when the cumputer system would shut down doing busy work hours, but the problem was resolved within minutes of them shuting down.

"Laid Back, Self Responsibility, Productive","Typical night at wal-mart was fun, a later shift and relaxing because you did not have anyone to tell you what to do you kinda already knew that you where going to be stocking some goods or some athletic supply or some cleaning whatever it was you where stocking and you had a deadline and that was 7 in the am, and i loved the management and the team because either one let you get behind you where there to help one another, the hard part is when you think that you are close to being done and there is another paled coming to your section, that is one of the hardest part and the not so enjoyable parts.",5,Former Employee,Freight Associate ,"Austin, TX",4/20/13,2013,4,20
Too many managers with conflicting demands,"The best part of my job as the OTC Manager at Walmart was the interaction with the customers. I was responsible for special orders, which gave me a sense that I was going the extra mile to take care of my customers' health care needs. I also enjoyed the many price comparisons and research into new innovative ways the help the customers. The difficult part of the job was in the fact that I was to answer to three hands on managers, each with conflicting tasks set for me to do in their minds. For example, I was told by one manager that I needed one more four-way shelving stand. Another manager told me that I could not have it, never taking into account that the other manager had assigned the task of setting one up. There was not enough communication between the managers, and when I addressed the issue of the conflict, I was yelled at, like I was the one causing the problem.",3,Former Employee,OTC Manager ,"Seguin, TX",4/20/13,2013,4,20
Retail chain,Walmart is a stable company to work for as they have always seemed to be a leader in retail. While all stores and management are different the management in this particular store needs a overhaul. There is a lot of favoritism and management is not willing to stand beside you. At Walmart you are just a worker and someone who can be replaced. They have seemed to lose all the values they were known for and its a shame.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Representative ,"Perry, GA",4/20/13,2013,4,20
Fun productive place to work,"A typical day at work was unloading the delivery trucks, bringing merchandise to the main floor, stocking, and providing excellent customer service. I learned how the overnight operations are essential to keeping the business running smoothly. Management was very helpful and was always willing to listen to any ideas or concerns. Co-workers always made the work fun and enjoyable. They were always willing to lend a hand to whoever needed it. The hardest part of the job at the time was the overnight hours. I had never worked overnight before so wasn't used to it. The most enjoyable part was the people I had the pleasure of working with.",4,Former Employee,Recieving Associate ,"West Plains, MO",4/20/13,2013,4,20

Productive with some flaws,"Most days at this job, time flies by which is good when you are on your feet 7-8 hours of the day. I have learned that when dealing with a customer you need to let them know that you care about their concerns and/or situations that he/she is going through. Sometimes depending on what the customer is demanding it gets hard to smile and acknowledge their problem to the fullest, but I have learned to smile and show that I do care about their problems that they were having in the store that day. Management at Walmart is very short staffed, meaning that if you are having a problem at the register it can take up to 30 minutes before a manager comes to see what is wrong, which in the long run not only makes you wait, but it also leaves customers waiting in line therefore making customers very uneasy because they just want to get out of the store and go about the rest of their day. My co-workers are the best co-workers anyone could ask for; they are so considerate of one another. Not only do we work hard as a team, but we have so much fun-one could barely describe it as doing work. The hardest part of the job is when a customer complains about something they need to return or exchange and you would gladly let them do it, but then a manager tells you that type of sell is not allowed because they purchased an electronic item and you (the employee) has to tell the customer that you can not do the sell which unfortunately sometimes makes the customer unhappy and irate. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you just had a rush then it starts to slow down for a bit and you go redline - more...",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Dexter, MO",4/20/13,2013,4,20
Nice work environment with very nice people.,Helped improve my customer service skills and time management skills. I would say the hardest part of working at a huge franchise like that would be trying to please the customer.

Not the same company I worked for in 2005,"The first few years of my job at Wal-Mart of Hartwell were pretty good, making good money and getting good benefits. However the last year that I worked there, things turned sour. I was stuck in a certain section of the store and was looking to be promoted to a better position but I couldn't get it past the management. Also the demands of the job had become unreasonable as of late. They were essentially asking us to squeese blood from a stone. I figured there might not be much of a future for me at this store so I decided to quit. Still, from my experience it was at one point a decent place to work but with the coming of the troubled economy, I think it took it's toll on management and then management took it's toll on us associates.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Hartwell, GA",4/19/13,2013,4,19

Not what it proclaims to be....,"Walmart is a decent place to work, however they offer low pay with high expectations. Although they try to enforce Corporate policies, it normally goes by the wayside depending on who you know. Opportunities for advancement are there, once again, depending on who you know. The hardest part of the job is accepting that policies are violated and overlooked consistently - depending on who you know. One person can get fired for something, while another can commit the same offense and just get written up. That gets to be extremely hard to ignore when it happens over and over. The best part of the job is definitely the friends you meet.

Productive and Fast Paced,"I very much enjoyed my time at Walmart. Everyday was a different challenge and you were always learning new things you didn't know the day before. My day at work as a cashier went very fast for me, I was always trying to be faster than the day before. I loved it. The job was very basic; checking people out, maintaining a clean and tidy work space, and giving people the best customer service possible. When I wasn't busy and had already finished my assigned tasks, I would get with a manager and see what else I could do to help. I was always looking for anyway I could help them do something that needed done. I was vey close to some of my managers and I would say that was my favorite part about working there. They knew how I worked and they knew I strived in perfection and to get it done as fast as I could. I'd say the hardest part about the job was the people. Everyone always makes jokes about how cashiers at Wal-Mart are so grumpy, but I tried not to be that way. Some people just had a bad day. Others just want someone to be mad at. Either way, I learned to not let that interfere with my work. The best way to kill a bad mood, is with a smile. I would have regulars come in and would go to my line and my line only. That is what I loved too. That I developed not just a valuable customer but a friendship too.

Career option of last resort,I can't say a lot of good things about Walmart. The experience varies from store to store but my experience was pretty negative.Management just kind of pays lip service to most employee issues.

Gain a lot of experiene,"Although Wal-Mart was not the place I wanted to have a career in I lasted almost 10 years there. I loved working with many of my co-workers including management. The problem is when you are working in retail, your availability needs to be open as much as possible so that you are able to meet the needs of the customers. This was where my problem began to occur. If you are a person that is raising a family, going to school, and working full time this might not be a good place for you. I can say that I have gained a lot of experience working for this company and there is room to grow if you are a hard worker with great customer service skills, have the ability to learn new things, and have the time available to meet the needs of the store. The benefits that are offered are good for a full time worker and you wouldn't expect that from a retail store.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Roseville, MI",4/18/13,2013,4,18

Just another part time job,"Ive worked for Walmart for a little over a year now as a stocker on overnights. For the most part the job itself isnt too difficult, but it does wear you out fast. The pay isnt terrible on overnights but is just minimum wage for day shift. You also get a 10% discount on most things in the store. They dont hire a lot of people full time, most of the associates are part time. You dont make much money, unless youre in management which isnt easy to get into. Some of the managers are great, but most of them are rude and dont care much about their employees. They expect the good, hard working people to basically kill themselves every night to get done while others barely do the minimum. Not a bad job, definitely not a career choice.",3,Current Employee,Receiving Associate ,"West Burlington, IA",4/18/13,2013,4,18
Great people...great place to work,"I learned team work is a must in a warehouse on a line. Warehouse work is fast paced and makes the day go very fast. My co-workers were easy to get along with and were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job I would have to say would be to meet the demands of your department when someone in another department was not meeting theirs. The trickle down effect really hits you. But you can get thru it. The most enjoyable part of the job is how fast paced it is...you are never bored! Management always tried to be somewhat ""fun"" ...Not too bossy.

"A place to eneteract with all types of people, grow and develop a staff, and grow further with the company.","A typical night at Walmart started by first pulling my schedule to see if I was staffed for the night, and accordingly plan for the night. I would then walk the store to see what my team and I could do to get freight out and change things around. The nightly meeting would be ten to fifteen minutes to plan and give clear direction on what needed to be done before 7 am. Working at night and the amount of work that needed to be done taught me to work with a sense of urgency and follow up and different tasks. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and also my fellow co-workers. The hardest part of being in management was the coaching and terminations. Its hard to sometimes let people go and write them up simply because everyone needs a job, but if the performance was not up to par then coaching for improvement had to be done.",4,Former Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Dallas, TX",4/17/13,2013,4,17

"Wal-Mart- Bad associates, but low price","My experience from working at Wal-Mart I found out that this company is not the best at providing customer service, from working at companies like Kroger and Publix, in which both of these companies pride themselves for customer service it is a total opposite at Wal-Mart. I seen associates catch attitudes with customers, some would not show a customer where a certain item they were looking for was. Wal-Mart follows a 10 feet rule which means that if you are within 10 feet of a customer you are suppose to greet them and smile. But from working there I could easily say that maybe 10% of the employees actually even speak to customers. And Wal-Mart also has very poor management, managers who talk down on you, some may yell or curse at you. And some of their managers even gossiped about certain associates to others.

Great Place to work,A typical day at work was busy and fast paced. I was lucky if I got to sit down for 30 min. I learned a lot about problem solving and time management. The management there was fair. Some where good and some would just not care. I loved some of my co workers. That's what made it easy to get up at 3 am to go to work. But there were some that would sleep at their desk and get away with breaking rules which I didn't like. The hardest part of my job would have been having to wake up at 3 am every morning and not know when I was going to get off that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I only worked 3 days a week.,4,Current Employee,Quality Assurance Associate ,"Cleburne, TX",4/16/13,2013,4,16

Life At WalMart,"I learned that there are different reasons why people work. Some for the money of course and other because they need social interaction or a sense of accomplishment.The people I worked with where, for the most part, wonderful people (of course everyone has a bad day from time to time).The hardest part of my job was to have friendships and supervise those friends. It took some serious thinking and learning how to motivate them. I finally had to explain that we can be friends outside of work but work is a job not a social gathering.The customers were extremely interesting. Some were very trusting and others no so much.

Good customer service and fun working with toys,Clock in and go to my department to start stocking shelves and helping customers. I learned a lot about toys.

Not a good place to work. PERIOD!,"They will guarantee you a certain amount of hours, you start out getting those hours, then from there, the longer you work there, the more they cut your hours back. You have to wait a full year to get medical coverage, and even then you have to maintain a certain number of hours, so typically they cut your hours until you fall just below the mark for getting benefits. You never have a set department, the managers expect you to complete 3-4 tasks at ONCE. If you don't have those tasks done in an hour, you're getting verbal and written punishments. They will pull you from your department to cover someone else's, but when your department starts to fall behind, they rip your tail over it. The managers will pick on the people they don't like until that employee quits or ends up getting fired. If you get hurt on the job and have to seek medical attention, expect either A. Your hours to get cut, or B. You get fired within the next month.",2,Former Employee,Customer Service ,"Ashland, KY",4/15/13,2013,4,15

"Great Co-workers, not such great Managers","In nearly 10 years for Wal-Mart, I've never had better co-workers. We made a great team. However, after our original store manager left to oversee another store about 3 years ago, things started going downhill as far as management was concerned. As people, they were great! As management, not so much. They would make sweeping changes that we all protested. Questioned how we'd been running things in departments successfully for years. To add insult to injury, they would expect out of one associate, the work of at least 3 people. We were short staffed, and morale tanked. They refused to hire anyone. We all knew that if they increased labor costs that management wouldn't get the bonuses they desired. Our profit share bonuses however, were far less than with the original management team. The hardest part of this job was watching people with whom you were trained, get fired or choose to retire because management decided they were no longer capable of doing their job. Some of those people had been there when the original store at 1600 Bechtle was built. The most enjoyable part of my job was the regular customers that came in when you were working. Many of them became more than just customers.",3,Former Employee,Lawn and Garden Associate ,"Bechtle Avenue, Springfield, Ohio",4/15/13,2013,4,15

It took me eleven months to find this part time Deli position at WalMart, due to recession, and I was very thankful to just get up and go to work every day, instead of looking for work and making nothing. Because of this, I stayed there for a year...keeping my eyes open. There was a lot of work involved, and I now have a whole different respect for any retail worker. The pay was very low, and the workloads could be amazing at times. Still, I was thankful. Because I worked in the Deli, pay was llittle bit more.

fast- paced customer oriented environment,I started by 7am usually before. I would walk my floor and check for mechandise that needed fillings and endcaps that needed changed. Then I would check my email and check what merchandise I was getting in make a plan for the day and head to my backroom. I would pick the merchandise needed and then fill my departments. After filling I would check my inventory and if an item wasn't already on order I would order it. In between these things I would help customers and help on register. I set up features and modulars in different sections weekly and helped maintain store cleanliness. i also attended daily meetings. I oversaw anywhere from 4-20 associates daily and gave them instructions and guidance. My co-workers were awesome. Upper management lacked communication and was not very unified. I learned how to be a great leader and that customers are number 1.

Wal-Mart pros and cons,Wal-Mart is a great place for those entering or reentering the workforce or those with disabilities. The company doesn't pay well but rewards you with retail experience and an opportunity to advance to better paying positions. It is difficult to gain full-time employment as most positions are part-time.My co-workers are hard working honest people. Most are glad to have a job.Management always sides with those who complain the loudest. I once had an associate fired by writing the corporate office an anonymous letter as he was a slacker with a long record of being a problem employee.

A fair company that treats its employees well,"I was a cashier at Wal Mart for nearly 2 years and while it was not my idea of a career it serves as a great place to work for those who might be transitioning or in school. A typical shift is 8 or 9 hours long with two fifteen minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch; shift shorter than 6 hours only get 1 15 minute break. There is an open door policy which makes it easier to deal with issues at work and makes management more approachable, although on the few occasions I used this policy I never found out if my issues were handled to my satisfaction or at all, so that's something that could use improvement. This company is very specific about what it expects from its employees and are upfront with those expectations from day one. They are very fair, or at least they were with me, to their employees and do try to work with them when they're having work related problems. Most of my coworkers were fun and easy to get along with and I even made a few lasting friendships there. I loved the opportunities to move up within the company and to transfer to other stores because it meant job security if I moved. The hardest part of this job was learning to deal with really upset customers in a way that wouldn't further upset them but also stick with company policy.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Idaho Falls, ID",4/12/13,2013,4,12

Wal-Mart Horrible Employer,"As soon as I would clock in I would go to the garden center and the store manager would tell us to organize and rearrange everything to change the layout of our products then 10 -15 minutes he would change his mind. I learned that good is never good enough. the hardest part of the job was well everything, everything would change on you and it was never in the same place twice. My co-workers were great because they helped me get the hang of things. I enjoyed working with the flowers an the customers but at the same token, the customers would be so darn rude to you or ask you a question an if you didn't have what they wanted they would throw a huge fit and make a scene and walk out. Also they would say you are part time but work you over part time hours and only pay you part time hours.",1,Former Employee,Garden Center Associate and Cashier ,"Elko, NV",4/12/13,2013,4,12
Productive and fun place to work,A typical day at work was very exciting. I learned how to many differnent tasks. My co-workers were great.

Okay for a part time job...,"A typical day of work consists of me checking the Customer Service Desk and gathering my department's returns. At times throughout my shift, I may be called to be on a register to help get customers flow out of the store as quickly as possible. Mostly, I clean out the fitting rooms, zone the merchandise and at times work in the Jewelry Department. I show customers items from our display cases, answer any questions, sell protection plans for certain items and answer phone calls regarding inquiries and our departments.Most enjoyable part is working alongside with some really great people. I have met many students my age who also work here part time. The hardest part of the job isn't really the job itself, it's management. There is sometimes a lack of communication between members of management, which leads to frustration and confusion at times. What I have learned from working at this job is really being able to multi-task and give excellent customer service regardless of anything else.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Mount Prospect, IL",4/12/13,2013,4,12
Long days and the management sucked,You stand at the register all day and only get a 15 min break. If you even got your break if there wasn't enough people then you didn't get it until way late.

I would cash them out in a fast and friendly manner and payed attention to detail with the way I bagged their items. I was also able to learn and broading my skills within the company by learning how to work the customer service desk. Working the customers desk consists of helping customers make returns in a fast and friendly manner, cash handling for returns, money orders, and western union payments. My co-workers were great because they always tried to make the most of their work day.

"Awsome company, hard work allows you to reach your goals, personal and professional","As a Wal Mart Supercenter store manager you are in charge of up to 400 employees, $8 million in average inventory, with sales reaching up to $100 million annually. You have to wear alot of different ""hats"". From maintenance to resetting the store at least once per year. The key to managing one of these ""beasts"" is to realizing that your people are your greatest asset. If you are not a people person you will fail miserably. Also you must be a visionary to be proactive in planning and execution of policies and procedures. The best part of the job is seeing your associates progress and move up in the company. Bottom line if you have a good team your store will be a great success, both the business itself and the business in and for your community. The hours are long to say the least, minimum of 55-60, 5-6 days per week. Very self fulfilling job but there is significant pressure managing these stores. You don't see many retired Wal Mart Store Managers, most of the time they leave because of the extreme pressure, found another less pressure job or health reasons. Your overall salary is well over 6 digits but you earn every penny, and then some.",5,Former Employee,Regional Trainer-Store Director ,Seven states,4/12/13,2013,4,12
Good if you need work or want to go into management,"My typical day in frozen/dairy, since my store combined the two and has ONE department manager over both areas, consists of: stocking moo juice and downstacking milk pallets, stocking eggs, stocking picks-products that are empty on store shelf- stocking dairy freight and binning it, stocking frozen freight if I'm the only department associate there or if it's necessary to help out.After lunch I finish up my stocking, zone the department to the best of my ability as time allows, fill milk and eggs, clean the cooler floor, and by then it's usually time to leave. I've learned to set goals and pace myself to get things done, and to ask for help if needed.Sometimes middle/upper management will pull you to go do something in another part of the store, i.e., unloading trucks, stocking other departments/ seasonal displays, etc. Management has their good and bad apples. Know who to avoid and you'll do fine. Department managers and co-workers are your friends, they are there in the trenches with you.The hardest part of the job is trying to perform the work of multiple workers in a store that is chronically understaffed. You won't get help when you need it. But that's ok, the store feels like a big family with the lifers and long-term employees. The break room is my favorite part of the job.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate- Frozen/Dairy ,"Covington, TN",4/11/13,2013,4,11

Work at Wal Mart,A normal day working at wal mart would consist of using a register and checking out customers in a timely fashion while providing great customer service. i learned a a lot about retail business. management changed all the time and each manager had different tactics and ways the wanted stuff done so it was difficult trying to keep changing what pace and details you show. Co-workers were fairly decent. a lot did not stay but the ones who did were great and i learned faster and new ways to get the work i needed to done. the hardest part of the job was holidays. the most enjoyable was meeting new people and having customers get to know you that they will always want to come to your line when at work.,4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Atchison, KS",4/10/13,2013,4,10

Sam Walton left a great goal for all employee's to reach , great customer service is our goal! The great people that you meet working at the Wal-Mart stores are people for your community, churches, schools, gyms, and your job also. Just everyday people with smiling faces and a willing to help with your shopping needs. This is not a hard place to work at to be honest, but being short staff from time to time makes it very awkward to run the front end.

Too much favoritism,"As soon as I'd get to work at least 2-3 people would leave on they're lunch/break or go home. Before I'd even washed my hands or read my duties for the day somebody was asking me to come help them or timers were going off. I'd get the food out first and immediately help the next customer in line. As soon as we could get the lines down and things calmed down managers would come around and give us more tasks and I haven't even got the second to even read what i was suppose to do. We were always short handed and constantly getting complaint from customers. There were a lot of times when it was only one person and a lot of times when it was only that person closing at night. I was constantly coming in early and staying late. It got to the point where other associates would call in before they're shifts and ask how the day is going and who had called in or hasn't showed up, and then later to find out that person has called in. There was even at time when other associates would come in intoxicated and swear and be extremely rude to the customers and management did nothing. I asked lots of times to be switched departments for about 5 months. I wanted to go back to the deli once they figured things out. But things just got to hectic there, I needed out.",3,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Tooele, UT",4/10/13,2013,4,10

"Fun work place, productive, easy to get around.",Working as a team was a perfect strategy while working there because we delt with less customers to working with a busy load. Walmart was always busy and most of the times all cashier stands had to be open because a rush came through and thats what I use to enjoy doing because working on a fast pace made the day go by faster. The hardest part was trying to call a department and no one answered so we had to shut down our stand and walk to the department to look for the product or the employee that was working in that department.,5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Honolulu, HI",4/10/13,2013,4,10

I would pull carts of product out to the sales floor restock my outs, and adding any new items as needed.In the deli, I learned to prepare, hot case food, and prepare custom trays, and sandwich orders. Rotating product FIFO. Also how to deal with difficult customers.I have always worked in an environment where management cared, and supported their workers. Not here the past couple years, it had changed drastically. You were no longer a person, you were a machine. We worked short staff, and managers still expected all tasks to be completed as if we were overstaffed.I must say on the most part my co-workers were great. I feel we worked great as a team. A few of us were like a family.The hardest part was restocking the freezer, product was heavy, and cold. So was the cooler, but not as bad. Finding room for product was sometimes difficult.The most enjoyable part of the job, I would say were the customers. We had many regulars, and I feel made new regulars by becoming friends instead of only servers.

Not a bad job for the compensation.,"A typical day in electronics consists of helping customers with their questions which requires that you be knowledgeable of the the products available in the store. You assist customers with their questions, demonstrate products (when applicable), check the back for items that are not stocked on the floor, and ringing up customer purchases. Part of the job is also to keep the section looking neat and organized and to stay alert to possible theft.I learned information about some electronics products that I was not as familiar with before starting the job. I also learned patience and to deal with upset customers.The hardest part of the job in my opinion was trying to get items for customers in a timely manner that were locked up in the back of the store. You had to get management to unlock them for you and a lot of the times there were only one or two managers in the store and it would take a while for them to come assist you. Customers would become upset when they had to wait for a long period of time to receive their item. Also dealing with rude customers in general.The most enjoyable part to me was my coworkers.

Horrible Walmart,"At first, I thought this was going to be a really down-to-earth job because it appeared that way at first. Once you start working there longer, the company reveals it's true side. The Wasilla, AK location is such a horrible place to work. I worked from 10pm to 7am night shift.The workers, specifically the women, were very flirtatious with the associates and the managers. I think they were like that because in all honesty, the accepted it instead of maintaining professionalism. Another thing I realized is they would rather have 5 people work the whole store, clean the whole store, take both our 15 minute breaks, take our 1 hour lunch, door greet, and assist customers (because it is a 24/7 store) yet want us to take less than 2 hours to complete our work.

Steady Work with nice employees,Clock in scan badge get assignment for the day. Do assignment then go home. I learned that no matter how much work you are given its always good to keep a great attitude towards your customers. Management sucks they are always pulling you to do someone's job when they could of scheduled someone there. then they yell at you for not completing the task you were originally assigned. The coworkers most of them are very friendly but like everyone if you have too much pushed on you they tend to get cranky.

Horrible place to work.,"I did not like working at Walmart at all. The company does not value their employees or show any appreciation for their work. The phrase 'overworked and underpaid' is very true of Walmart. You cannot tell anything personal to a co-worker, no matter how much you trust them, because your business spreads like wildfire. You also have to deal with the customers who do not treat you as if you're a person. There are no enjoyable moments of working at Walmart.",1,Former Employee,Service Writer/Cashier ,"Houston, TX",4/8/13,2013,4,8
Sale associate at Walmart,When I started working at walmart it was GREAT! I was raising my daughter on my own. People were nice and I'm still friends with some after 6 years. I worked there for a year and I felt that I had to quit due to being uncomfortable around a manager. I asked for my job back after walking out and was made to apologized to that manager for walking out on the shift. The store manager didn't believe a word I said.

Just an example,"I loved the benefits and while it was a great company to work for, there were a few flaws which left me no choice but to resign. In the specific store I worked for, it was probably one of the few Walmarts that closed at midnight instead of the usual 24 hours. The biggest flaw with the store was the management, they seemed to prefer favoritism over an employee's actual work ability. There were employees, who after just two weeks of the start of their employment, developed a romantic relationship with a department manager and was thus given special treatment. Also, there were employees who would just flat out refuse to work and chose to gossip their entire 7-8 hour shift, which left the employees who actually came in and worked to pick up their slack. Management, even those higher up than the store manager, refused to remedy the situation despite numerous complaints. I have asked for a transfer and the reason they gave me for not allowing me to transfer was that I was an exceptional employee and the store would go to shambles without me.",2,Former Employee,Inventory Control Specialist ,"Middle River, MD",4/8/13,2013,4,8

However, the same thing over and over gets old and the only thing that keeps you going are your co-workers. They do a really good job at hiring balance of personalities. The have a horrible system in place of part-timers. If you are part time you get no benefits, only 3to4 days of work (No. your off days are not together) and you are only allowed to work 72hrs per pay period. Because the are no sick days or vacation days if you call in/ late more than 3 times in any given year You Will Be Terminated no questions asked.

Productive and enjoyable working environment,Wal-mart pharmacy provided an excellent stepping stone for me as a student into the world of retail and customer service. Wal-mart taught me a lot about how to handle patients and customers and your work load in an efficient manner. Management was very helpful and was there to encourage you at every step of the way. A typical work day was about 8-10 hours with a half hour lunch break and a 15 minute break in between. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting such a wide variety of people in such little time.

I learned tons it is hard to explain everything. I really enjoy learning. Management was pretty good. I don't think I have anything bad or good to say about them. They treated me pretty well. I think co-workers are all unique. When I look back at them I learned a lot about getting along with all different kinds of people. I just accept them for who they are. The hardest part of the job for me was the inconsistency of the hours. It would have been nice to have a set schedule and not have the hours go up and down so much. I enjoyed a lot about this job.

Great workplace with a few quirks!,Overall I enjoyed working at walmart. I just didn't like the fact that they didn't really care about their employees. What I mean by that is if something were going on at home and you had to leave early and/or miss work for no matter what reason they would still count it against you. A typical day at work for me was pretty good just stand at my register and take care of the customers. Then I would talk to my friends around the work place. What I learned was to be more patient with customers. My co-workers were really great I was friends with just about all of them. The hardest part of my job was knowing how little the management cared about my life.

I,then, proceed to the accounting office for my daily accounting paperwork that includes but not limited to my daily audits of cashiers. Next, I prepare my front end schedule which includes scheduling cashiers their lunches and breaks and tasks that must be completed given to me by my supervisor. The tasks that my supervisor request done can include using a pallet jack to move pallets to a different location. I then count the cash podium and make sure that its balanced. After that, I count down all front nine registers. My next task is to load self checkout registers with the preset money. In between all of this I must still keep a lookout of my front end for potenial lines at registers and ensure that cashiers are given their breaks or lunches on time, open cash registers when needed, give change to cashiers, and take care of any customer concerns or needs.",4,Current Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Orlando, FL",4/8/13,2013,4,8

My co workers were a mix of personalities and one had to learn what made each one tick so to speak in order to maintain a good atmosphere.

walmart,"To sum up Wal-Mart without having to write a book basically, all you need to do is compare it to our government. Full of greed, lies and fake smiles. People constantly stealing, along with workers too like management. Even the in-store lost prevention steal from there.

Looks Great On Paper:,"Walmart, as a company, has good core values.Respect for the Individual:As a support manager, it is my duty to follow up and motivate my associates to complete their tasks quickly and accurately. If they are running a little slow; assess the situation and provide a solution. There is an associate on light duty, due to an injury on the job, at the fault of another support manager. He is under strict doctor's orders to NOT lift anything and to not reach above his head, to prevent any further damage caused by the initial accident. On a nightly basis, he is asked to stock shelves by my superiors. Mind you; stocking involves nothing BUT lifting and reaching. Being the good man that he is- taking into consideration that we could definitely use the help; seeing as how we stay short handed- he agrees to stock freight. Management is aware of his condition. They are aware of his orders of what not to do. Yet, on a nightly basis, I am instructed to verbally coach him and ask him to pick up the pace. Because he moves entirely too slow... Doing a job he is under strict orders NOT to do. Respect, indeed.Service to our Customers:We have multiple overnight associates that have worked for walmart for very long periods of time, doing many different jobs. Some can cut fabric, some can mix paint, some can make keys. Personally, I see these people as assets. Granted; 3:30 a.m. is an odd time to come to walmart, needing a key made or to have paint mixed. But, we all attended orientation and discussed how priority number one is The Customer.

Third Shift at Wal-Mart,"A typical night at Wal-Mart consists of unloading frozen, dairy, and meat products on pallets from trucks. I am usually paired with another associate or two. We take pallets to the freezer or cooler, sort out the products, and then stock while assisting customers if necessary. After we are done stocking, any overstock is immediately logged into inventory. Our managers are always diligent and very accepting of feedback. Unfortunately, the managers have a habit of not staffing enough people during the night. Working here has broadened my knowledge of both food safety and inventory management. I have established deep friendships with some of my co-workers and we all work together to get our job done.

Wal-Mart is an okay job experience. if you dont have any health issues.,"well i first started working for wal-mart in february of 2012 as a cashier. pay was good considering i was just part time. as are all cashiers. in july of 2012 i advanced to deli thinking it would be a better suit for me. more money,better hours. and health benefits. about 2 weeks into working in the deli i had been throwing up daily. and leaving working early all the time. i went to the e.r after work one day and they told me i was allergic to the cooking oil the deli used. so i asked to be transferred back to being a cashier. they would NOT let me go back to being a cashier so i agreed that i would go to TLE as a service writer. but until then i had to stay in the deli. well days go by and i still have yet to sign my transfer papers to go to TLE. so i went to managment to talk to them about it. they had given my job in TLE to someone else. they offered to move me to pets but that would require me to lift heavy boxes/bags which i cannot do because i have sculiosis and a pinched nerve. because i could not accept their offer in pets that told me i HAD to stay in deli . i had to quit this job on the spot as i had lost 20lbs in 2 weeks. to this day they still give me a bad refference when someone calls. i hope you all have a better experience's with this company then i did.",2,Former Employee,Sales Associate/Cashier/Deli ,"Jacksonville, AL",4/4/13,2013,4,4

Bad place to work for. Work there and take your life in your on hands,If you want a good paying job then go for it. All they upper management care about is numbers. To them all your are a just a number. I work at a dc# and that is all they cared about. There is no opportunity for advancement unless you have a degree. They have been having managers step down down to associates. That is not fair. They do not care about any body else about there jobs because the are in management. Everybody that wants to work for walmart should look at all the factors. They care about themselves and nobody else. There benefits are bad. They claim they are the best retail company to work for I think you would be better off cleaning wipers on street at least than you would not be subject to production or a number. Because that is all the care about. I know from being there and I have seen it. The place is bad for people and any that applies should be aware that you may have a job now but it will be taken away from you if you do not meet there goals which is impossible. I know from being there. I hope this helps. There are better jobs out there then being a number.,1,Former Employee,unloader ,"Marcy, NY",4/3/13,2013,4,3
"Great Management, comfortable environment","Working retail at Wal Mart was simple, the managers were very helpful, and the hours were flexible enough that I managed to go to school full time at Brevard Community College while working 40 hours a week.

There were pharmacists that would not fill in at my store unless they knew I was working that day. Then, we got a new pharmacy manager. I don't know if she felt threatened by me or if she just wanted to be the only one in the pharmacy that was competent. She fired me, I have yet to find out why I was actually terminated. I fought with home office HR, because she said I was terminated due to a no call no show that didn't exist. Now that has been removed from my files, but I still don't know why I was terminated.

Growing up on an Island is different from growing up in the state, and in the city where there are a lot of social communications with fellow peers. Growing up to realize that there are a lot that I have been missing, and experiences of the world.

Wal-mart is the only company that I have worked for that they only give out yearly raises even when you first start as well as any types of benefits. The insurance rates are so high that most people that work there cannot afford to get the benefits, that is why about 80% of the employees are on some type of governmental assistance. Management is really bad, the store manager hides in the office all day and is barely seen through out the day.

First shift would do the best they could but we were always behind with no assistance from the managers and other daily things to do. Managers would often pull members of our team to go to another section of the job because someone wasn't at work leaving us with less hands and more work to do the next day.

I clock in and check my staffing for the day of numerous areas. Understaffed store so it can get a little crazy,"I come into work and go to the computer to check my staffing for my numerous areas. When i am done with that I have to generate the trucks that are coming into the docks to drop off merchandise on the computer and assign personnel to trucks.I then take a tour of my areas to see what the overall condition of them looks like, and identify opportunities of improvement. If i work and early shift, such as my eight to five i am in charge of getting personnel to set up for the truck for that day and i help unload it at the end of my shift. If i work and elevin to eight, after the truck is done and in between them i have to go and check out the front registers if my partner manager is not there.I have seven other zone supervisors that i am in contact with in my job that i am in regular contact with and about eight managers that i work with.The hardest part of my job is planning of my work because when i do the planning, it sometimes changes dramatically. The most enjoyable part of my job is when i can help a customer with a issue that they have and i can see the smile on there face.In closing i am an intelligent, caring and empathetic person that always like to learn new things. I enjoy meeting new people and helping them with their problems. My interests are many and knowledge is power.

very biased company. its who you know that matters.,often told to work outside your department and then get in trouble for not getting your own tasks done. poor pay. decent hours.,2,Former Employee,Assembler ,"Ware, MA",4/2/13,2013,4,2
I wouldn't work there again.,The management never worked together at all. Different managers would pull people from different departments to work register and do other jobs that should have been manned. At any given walmart they seemed to not meet the required employees to work during the day. Either all the employees were out of toys on registers which made the department look rough for the next day. I've eye witness many threats on single mothers to work over time or they'd lose their job and in doing so lose their children.,1,Former Employee,People Greeter ,"Mebane, NC",4/2/13,2013,4,2

I wish I still worked there,I assisted in the setting up of the photo department before the grand opening. From day one I enjoyed my job there. I felt my co-workers were all wonderful and our department supervisor was great also. We (the walmart staff) was like a big family. Every morning we did our walmart cheer which some didn't enjoy but I did. There were times we'd have pajama day where all the staff would come in wearing pajamas which was so cool. We had a couple that worked at the store that planned on getting married. The greatest most awesome thing was that the store manager allowed this couple to get married in the store and provided such a wonderful wedding cake for them. It was things such as that that made it a great place to work.,5,Former Employee,Photo Technician ,"Mount Pocono, PA",4/2/13,2013,4,2
"Exciting, ever changing, very unpredictable place to work.","Working at Walmart during the daytime consist of anything and everything that could possibly happen and or does happen. Customer accidents, associate accidents, staffing issues with call in and having shortage on floor to help customers, register issues, customer issues, merchandise issues, and theft issues. We have a management team that pulls together at all times because we all have one common goal and that is to get merchandise on counter, sold, and make sure the customer is fully satisfied. Overnight at Walmart is all about distribution. Getting that merchandise to counter and getting store zoned by am so that customers can shop a nice neat store. The hardest part of the job is the plan you start with always changes and its a constant re planning that goes on to get the task done throughout day and night. I enjoy the job greatly because every day is different and you get that chance to meet new people daily.",4,Current Employee,Assistant Manager ,"Lafayette, LA",4/2/13,2013,4,2
Not such a fun place to work,"Honestly Walmart really used to be a fun place to work. They actually used to care about their associates. But the last few years that I worked there, it all seemed to just go down hill. I thought it was maybe just the store I was at, but I have recently learned that it wasn't just my store, it's all stores. They seem to care more about keeping the money for themselves and hire less and put more responsibilities on the ones that are still employed. Even customers notice the decrease in help. We are human and we can only handle so much and have so many hours in a work day to accomplish tasks.",3,Former Employee,Department Manager ,"Florence, SC",4/2/13,2013,4,2
Bad place,Great people to work with. Managment doesn't stick up for you at all. Managment throws you under the bus. They have managers that don't know what there doing and they ask you for your help since you know. They don't like to change anythign and threaten to fire you if you have to be out of work for your child. I wouldn't work there again all it is is a big headache that you shouldn't have to deal with. If managment would get off there high horses and do there job the store wouldn't perform the way it does. Nobody likes working there.,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Clerk ,"Louisburg, NC",4/2/13,2013,4,2
Productive place to work but hours are very slim.,"My shift starts at 10pm. to 7am. I am a overnight cashier. I also stock the shelves, build end caps, set modules.

Wasn't exactly the greatest job.,"A typical day at work consisted of being treated wrong by my department manager, or working by myself in the cooler. I learned how to bin items, and pull picks. The management there was the nicest. If you went to them about a certain problem by using their open door policy it did no good. They would report what was needed to be reported, but wouldn't do anything further. A couple of my co-workers were friends of mine before I started there and they were great, and a lot of the other people I worked around were great. The hardest part about this job was the heavy lifting when I have a bad back. What I enjoyed most about this job was being able to work by myself for the most part on the weekends.",3,Former Employee,Dairy/Frozen Associate ,"Miles City, MT",4/2/13,2013,4,2

Can be kind of stressful and fun depending on the type of day.,I wish Walmart would be more family friendly to single parents with young children in school and have no help to support and help their struggling children in school with their school work.. A typical day could be fun. Management is kind of cool they really don't be on your back all day.,3,Current Employee,Front-End Cashier ,"Memphis, TN",4/1/13,2013,4,1
Walmart,"I enjoy my job. The Customer Service part. I love being the one with the answers to the customers' questions. I like seeing new faces every day and having the weekly customers that I recognize and can have conversations with. I do wish, though, that the managment team would back up their employees more. Those of us without the title of 'Manager' are the ones riding the front lines. We deal with the public more and we see more things than most could understand. We get cursed at on a daily basis and no one supports us. I truly believe that Walmart, as a huge corporation, is amazing to work for.

What I loved about walmart is that for the most part they promote within, so there is always that bond between supervisor and employee. With 500 employees, you run in to every single type of person.

I enjoyed working as a sales floor associate.,"Basically working in all the departments I did, the main goal was to help the customer any way possible. I loved learning about each and every department I worked in. I would run a register and help customers with there purchases and money handling. I had wonderful managers that honestly cared about their employees. The hardest part would honestly be when you just felt like there wasn't enough of you to go around. I constantly wanted to help everyone and learn everything I could to be an utility in the company. My co-workers were just as helpful as I was and it was just a fun environment. I loved watching all the happy customers leaving. I even got to be greeter every now and then which was really rewarding.",5,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Lenoir, NC",3/30/13,2013,3,30

Work At Your Own Risk,"A typical day of unloading trucks is decent hard work, and the compensation for this position is grossly under paid.What I've learned is how to work in a warehouse and properly handle merchandise using power lifting equipment.Management has no communication between each other, and often forgets that the position is there to enable hourly associates to have what they need to do the job they are given.Your Co-Workers will be settled in there position.The Hardest part of the job is the political aspect that is constantly flowing around you.The most enjoyable part of the job is having one.",3,Current Employee,Inventory Management Specialist ,"Citrus Heights, CA",3/30/13,2013,3,30
A place to work till I find a better opportunity.,"I usually work in the dairy or in the backroom, however my managers use me in all different parts of the store because I know them all well. Using a gemini (work electronics) we pick merchandise out of the backroom and take it to the floor for the associates to work and put it back in the system after it has been worked. I've learned to deal with different people and a variety of personalities working with fellow associates as well as an array of customers. The hardest part of the job is everyone working together and on the same page. It seems as though management between nights and days aren't always communicating the right things and we tend to redo a lot of things over and over again. The most enjoyable part of the job is the few friends I have made which make the job worth it however a better opportunity is wanted because this is not a career and I want to start something I can evolve with.",3,Current Employee,Backroom ICS ,"Hayden, ID",3/30/13,2013,3,30
Fast Pace Workplace,Even though the associates are friendly and upbeat people it is a demanding job that requires focus and dedication. On a typical day you need to be able to task in and complete your jobs in an efficient manner but on time. As an ICS Associate it is prefered that you be flexible and get department picks done as quickly as possible so that the floor team may stock it. Management is a little crazy but they make it work even if it is sometimes a little overbearing and tends to give misunderstandings. Co-workers are all different and depending on the team you work with there will be a type of humor that may tend to lean on the borderline of professional. The hardest part of the job is making sure that before 1am all picks are completed and before 7am the hallways and backrooms are clear of merchandise that should be in the bins. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with the associates in a fun and friendly way while racing to the finish line to get our work done.,4,Current Employee,ICS Receiving ,"Riverdale, UT",3/30/13,2013,3,30
Wonderful workplace with even better people.,"A day at work at Wal-Mart is never boring. There's always something to do and a person (or two!) to talk to. The managers make sure you stay busy, but Wal-Mart is never slow. Customer Service is a must. Customers are the most important part of a business!Having friendly co-workers is a big plus, too. Although some of them can be rude at times, everyone has a bad day now and then. But a good lesson to take from Wal-Mart is that generally, if you're polite to someone, they'll return the favour. And that is very important for Customer Service to be successful.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Covington, LA",3/30/13,2013,3,30

A good average joe job,"If you are still in high school or currently a college student then walmart is a great place to be employed. Wal-Mart has flexible hours that can accomidate any student. The benefits of Wal-Mart are what make Wal-Mart a leading competition for consideration of employement. Such benefits include, two weeks paid vacation annualy, quartly bonuses, 10% discount, and direct deposit. However, there is little chance of advancment in the company unless you have seniority. Even if you may be the most qualified person for a management position, Wal-Mart will 80% of the time promote the most senior person who applies for the job. Management also is a disadvantage in the company. However, Wal-mart is a good way to get started, especially if it is your first job.",3,Current Employee,Photo Center Specialist ,"Pewaukee, WI",3/29/13,2013,3,29

Enjoyable at times.,"The days were very different and it was always a learning experience. I learned that you have to be very cautious when dealing with multiple customers at once. Management assisted when they could but they usually sent another employee who knew more i the particular area to help when needed. The co workers made the daily routine of working at Wal mart much more enjoyable and they helped even when told not to because it may not be their particular area. The hardest part of the job was having to move to a different department within the store and completing the task in that area. Sometime is consisted of pulling pallets of things that were much taller then me, or to use equipment that I was not trained to use. The part I enjoyed most was helping the customers locate items in the store or just answering their questions it made me feel like I was needed and I was glad to be able to help.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Owings Mills, MD",3/29/13,2013,3,29

Hardest part was physical labor. Most enjoyable part was interaction with people.,3,Former Employee,Tire and Lube Technician ,"Port Charlotte, FL",3/29/13,2013,3,29
Negative Atmosphere and poor training programs,"I believed this company a great company when I began, Had benefits, full time positions, should have training programs down to a science. As years went on the company got progressively worse. Training is the worst I've ever seen, which is amazing as large as they are. While they offer annual raises, one must bend over backwards to receive any. an associate is forced to work like a robot, not a person, even down to the time he/she has to stock a case of inventory. Management is known to lie and cheat. Getting bonuses were impossible, there was always one reason or another for us not to earn them, even though the management team always seemed to get theirs. Morale in the associate team is depressing. Its very hard to attend work on a daily basis.",2,Current Employee,Inventory Management ,"Lakewood, CO",3/29/13,2013,3,29
Is a secure job,"It's a nice place to work and stability. Meeting new people everyday is also a plus, but it has its down falls. Often i don't feel treated equally with other employees and the benefits aren't good. I've been working here for almost 4 years and only make $9.35 an hour. I have so much experience in different departments in the store and feel like i deserve more. With that being said this is my reasoning on searching for a new job and or career. It's normally busy and that's something that i love, makes the day go by faster. Ive learned so much from knowing how to present myself in front of a customer to counting and handling large quantities of money. Management is not fair on how they make decisions between employees and co-workers make it easier to deal with. We normally encourage each other and help one another. The hardest part of this job is dealing with rude customers, but even that's not hard for me. It sometimes gets a little uncomfortable but i always master the situation and the customer leaves happy or content.

I truly enjoyed the sense of accomplishment that I received while holding this position. Every completed task was very rewarding both on a personal and a business level. I would have to say that the most difficult and challenging part of the job was in the beginning.

I work 8 hour shifts, 40 hours a week. I do alot of repetition with picking up 5 to 70 lb. boxes. Pulling pallets with pallet jacks. I love the people I work with.

"A good place to work, but somewhat convoluted.","The job pays well and has good advancement options, but only if you're already doing well. If you have the wrong mindset for your current job within the building, and you struggle with it, then you'll be stuck in that position until you either quit or are fired. The management seems to feel that their workers are something other than human. They feel that all workers should be doing their jobs absolutely perfectly, being able to keep up with more than we're able, while still keeping everything neat and correct. But, on the plus side, the health insurance is good, and extremely cheap compared to other places of employment, and it pays well.",4,Current Employee,"Unloader/Receiver, Loader/Shipper ","Opelousas, LA",3/28/13,2013,3,28

Good if you're in school,"I worked as an overnight associate and couldn't say that it was the best place to be.... but it certainly wasn't the worst. The schedule was pretty consistent; I worked on register for a few hours, did some freight, took my break, did some cleaning, took my lunch, finished up my tasks, took another lunch, and finished any last minute things that needed to be handled before 7 am. I learned a lot about cash handling and what NOT to do as an aspiring manager/supervisor. I also learned a lot about how employees view a business based on rules and actions shown through different management styles. My co-workers were decent; we all had our bad nights but who doesn't? I can honestly say they were my team though, we worked through a lot of bad situations together. The hardest part of the job was probably the long periods of time when I'd have nothing to do. These were usually Sunday nights when we didn't have that many customers. I always got bored and tired really fast and it was annoying. The best thing about the job? Probably the people I worked with. If it wasn't for them I may have gone crazy.",4,Current Employee,Overnight Cashier ,"Dover, DE",3/28/13,2013,3,28

need to do better when it comes to vets that they hire,"a typical day at walmart is: showing up on time, cleaning area, straightening up foods and shelves, pulling truck and putting food in proper places, restocking shelves with food, pulling old food and throwing it away, and helping others when needed. ive learned that its harder than it looked to be an overnight stocker. if something is wrong with the equiptment in your area you have to fix it or find a way to fix it. ive learned that managment does care about vets who are injured. when your injured and a vet make sure you make it load and clear what you can and can not do before you get hired, so that way they cant say you didnt tell them and get fired. injured or not if you dont get your list of things to do done by the managments eyes you get talked to about it. if you get three talkings about anything they let you go. this walmart is not family type people, or care about employees families. the hardest part of this job was pulling the trucks and getting locked out when dumping trash. the enjoyable part of this job was going home to my family and the discount i got for the store.",1,Former Employee,Overnight Stocker ,"Omaha, NE",3/28/13,2013,3,28

The managers changed often to give them the experience of learning a new department overall they were managers. I had a small group of coworkers and were were very close no problems I highly respected them all. The hardest part of the job was being managed by more than one manager One would say one order and another would point you in the opposite directions It was hard to know which way to go and frusterating to explain that you were asked otherwise.

The different job titles in the store are able to be done by anyone who wants to learn and I have accomplished most of them by my manager letting me explore and learn the store. A typical day is like any day for retail, its all about customer service, making sure the product is out and available to the customer and that anything and everything we have on the sales floor is also available in the backroom if needed by a customer if it is not stocked on the sales floor. Sometimes its a smooth day and sometimes its not but, its Walmart, everything happens.",4,Current Employee,Cashier/Checker ,"Waxahachie, TX",3/28/13,2013,3,28

Not only that, The CSM's were mostly on time for giving breaks/lunchbreak, plus some customers become familiar faces and enjoy shopping at Wal-Mart just to come through your line to see you. Furthermore, if the customers like the way the managers are running the store they would put in a good word for you whenever the time presented itself. However, the hardest thing about working in customer service I believe is dealing with customers with bad attitudes and if your not careful those bad attitudes could rub off on you and cause trouble.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Rowlett, TX",3/27/13,2013,3,27

Most terrible place to work ever!,"The actual people who were not management were amazing and hardworking, most of them. Management was terrible no one knew what the other had planned. Very unorganized and many racial discrepancies among management. Along with many other problems.

poor communiccation,the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers. i run across so many personalities in one day that it is awesome. the second part i like about my job is working with some of the other associates. the ones that show up every day for work makes the work day seem to run smoothly. the part i hate about walmart is the lazy people that are hired with the company. the ones who gets the job but then call out every time they are scheduled to work. another thing i dislike about the job is the poor communication with management.overall my experience working at walmart is a cool environment.,2,Current Employee,Inventory Control Specialist ,"Baltimore, MD",3/22/13,2013,3,22

Great place to work if you have a family,"I was labeled a Sales Associate for the Garden Center upon my job landing with Wal-Mart, with previous management experience I was a floater within the whole store within a few months. I could breeze through the entire store and knew more than most manager's who had been with the company for years. I could downstack trucks, water/care for plants, stock almost any department, bin and pick from the telxon and much more. I eventually settled in T.L.E. which landed me out of the store floating and tied me in with some of the greatest co-workers in the store. The worst part about the place is that management often looks past even the best of the best employees to keep them paid to a minimum (but working hard) and bumps up the common guy which lights a fire under them.The most enjoyable part for me is the fact that if I need any time off for my family or anything in general, it is easy to obtain, but it still lacks badly in pay when you are far over qualified to be in a sales position.",2,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Oxford, AL",3/22/13,2013,3,22

Clerical positions,"A typical day consisted of 10 hours. I learned more about inventory, their ERP IT System through their trucking department, inventory department, and receiving and shipping departments. The management were well informed and helpful and I enjoyed working with them daily. Co-workers were fellow team members who strived to do their best. The hardest part of the jobs that I had was learning that I only had 10 hours to complete my tasks and understanding that the next shift coming in would finish what was left. I like to finish everything I start but in Walmart it is a continual process that many times just gets continued into the nest shift. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I met and worked with.",5,Former Employee,Profile Clerk ,"Sterling, IL",3/22/13,2013,3,22
An un-flexible money craving company,"Working as a cashier at walmart has been one of the worse cashiering jobs and experiences overall.The only minor pro to this job is the pay. (I think it was due to past experience) but I was paid almost a dollar over minimum wage, all my past cashiering jobs I was paid close to (if not) minimum wage.As a walmart employee they work you til literal death; from the very get go the schedule given to you is really insane (close to 38 hours a week) 2 hours short of minimum because Walmart is a tight/stingy company who tries to avoid full time (because of mandatory benefits..etc) Management also can be very rude and unfriendly.""Salaried"" Management claims to always be available for any questions or concerns, yet majority of the time they're outside smoking cigarettes, they also gives you hard time when you need immediate time off (with a valid urgent family emergency)Upon getting an job offer @ walmart, you spend almost 9 hours watching videos about the history (which is quite interesting), common rules and etc about Walmart. The worse part is the next following day when they have you do close to 18 hours total of pointless, stupid repetitious computer training/simulations on computers. Upon completion (usually takes between 2-3 shifts) you then ""shadow"" an ""experienced"" cashier for just about an entire week before getting your own register and etc (even though it doesn't take a caveman a whole day to learn how to operate a register).",2,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Tempe, AZ",3/22/13,2013,3,22

I enjoyed mentoring, training, and teaching some of the younger ones. The Management staff at Wal-mart only cared about and did what made them look good.

Not work slow workers,"A typical day at work for me included stocking groceries, working in the backroom, setting up displays and occasionally being calling up front to cashier. I learned so much from wal-mart, I learned how to order merchandise and what upper management is looking to see concerning the merchandise on the floor. Some of that entailed counting, pricing changes markdowns etc. The management at wal-mart was fantastic, they were able to lead and also work hard. I worked very well with all the mangers and had been spoken to on various occasions concerning being prepared to become a future manager. The co workers in my department were generally all hard workers. Communication among us was key in order to ensure that the full work load for the day was completed.

I did not go any further due to my family situation.I left the company I was an over night stocker and had worn many hats over the years.A typical day is sometimes stressful after the company set time limits to complete the task assigned each night. I was not apposed to that but I felt sometimes the variables in place to achieve the time passed down was never the same once it got to the store level. If one component wa missing the times would never equal to what is fair to evaluate an individual on their performance.The most enjoyable part of my night was the interaction with the customers, especially when I am able to solve a problem or locate an item thay have not been able to locate. I love the art of helping others. Because we are all human and not perfect dealing with other associates is not a problem I had or encountered.

What I needed,"Working at Wal-mart has certainly has its moments like any other place of employment. For me, it has been the job that I need it to be. My superiors have always shown me the utmost respect and compliance when working with my hectic school schedules or personal issues that have risen over the past seven years of my employment. While there are those who have had constraining issues with the company, I personally have felt no animosity or ill-will towards my supervisors or co-workers, and for this I have been truly fortunate. Along with my schedule, medical, and bonus benefits, the most constraining part of my job has been the excruciatingly long hours and heavy workloads that I am subjected to. It's a constantly changing environment and with that comes added stresses of new projects and inventory preparations that can take weeks to accomplish. Sometimes this unfortunately enables a few normal 8 hour work days quickly turning in to the inevitable 32 hour straight grind. These hardships in my opinion do not outweigh the benefits therefore I do not mind coming in early, staying late, being scheduled on my days off, or losing weekends and holidays.",5,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Morgantown, WV",3/21/13,2013,3,21

"Well, well Wal-Mart","I worked part time at the same Wal-Mart Supercenter one two seperate occasions. I believe that every job I've had and left would be more than happy to rehire me and this was certainly the case with Wal-Mart. I would usually work about 30 hours a week, sometimes more if it was a particularly busy time like a holiday, and sometimes less.Wal-Mart taught me to be fast as you work with a high volume of customers and items. You have to be friendly but also efficient and quick. I enjoyed that though it did get to the point where it ceased to be challenging and I grew bored.I got along splendidly with my co-workers and managers. One of things I truly love about Wal-Mart is the various parts of society that are represented both in the employees and the customers. I adore being able to interact with such varied facets of our culture. I find it invigorating.The hardest part of my job was simply that it could be somewhat overwhelming but that was a direct result of not having enough coverage. I do not mind busy, I enjoy it in fact, I can easily slip into a groove but sometimes it could get a bit ridiculous.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Ozark, MO",3/20/13,2013,3,20

Not much to say.,"It was a good and (mostly) steady job. I was trained properly and always felt comfortable doing my assigned duties. My biggest complaint was the company's unwillingness to work with schedules/my personal life. I got sick a lot while working for Wal-Mart, and as such I came into work ill. They would often send me home and have that absence count against me. They would tell me to schedule doctor's appointments 'on my own time', but my schedule as such was for me to work during doctor's office hours. I missed a lot of work in 2009 and 2010 due to my mother having seventeen strokes and heart surgery and nearly dying, and I was ultimately let go because of these absences, despite having a medical leave of absence form.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Carson City, NV",3/20/13,2013,3,20
Not horrible,Working there was great in the beginning. Things started to change as new managers got hired. They wouldn't except doctors notes and would write you up even if you had one.

Learned Alot About Retail,"When I first started working for Wal-Mart my first position was working at the Fitting Room, my management team saw that I had more to give to the store, so they promoted me to Salesfloor Associate which gave me more responsibilites and more knowledge of the day to day store process. I was then promoted one more time to the Photo Lab, at which time I found my so called ""calling"", I was being challenged and making customers happy that their pictures were as important to me as to them.

Not the best company to work for,"I liked my job in the beginning, however, towards the end, it became very depressing, disappointing, and not very enjoyable. My co-workers were constantly complaining about minor things, attitudes were poor, and my hard work was going unnoticed. In the beginning, they always gave me credit where it was due. Management was all over the place. I felt like they did not treat all employees as equal, even though they want to appear as if they do not discriminate. The job was not hard just frustrating because they did not have enough associates or cashiers. My job was not to be a cashier, however I ended up being one due to lack of employees. Constant complaints from customers since the company did not hire enough cashiers. I wasn't able to perform my job, as an apparel associate, to the best of my ability because I was busy doing other people's jobs & covering breaks. I enjoyed working with people, but I did not enjoy being pulled around, all different places like a ""puppet"" with no say.",2,Former Employee,Apparel Sales Associate ,"Wareham, MA",3/20/13,2013,3,20

Walmart...not for me,"I work there currently as a support manager. My co workers are friendly, upper management such as the assistant managers are disorganized and untimely. The hardest part of my job is figuring out which assistant manager to listen to because of the lack of communication, I am stuck in the middle of a feud and being told to do 2 different things at once which is obviously impossible. I do enjoy the quiet time I get at work because it is rare and I am able to get my work done. I do the same work and most days even more as the assistant managers and get paid less than half of what they make and they usually sit in the office and make me do all their work for them and they are automatically paid for it because they make salary. I worked for a different walmart before as a zone supervisor and it was never ever like the one I work at now.

"The customer's come first, but the associate's should also come first which i feel wasn't the case most of time.","My typical day would be clocking in for the day, walking up front to see what register i would be working. I wouldn't always stay at that register though, i would move around (i.e. a different reg. or customer service, or going and working a dept.). The hardest part of the job is balancing family and work, it was hard to find family time last minute if it came up (birthday party, other family functions). The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customer's thanking you for doing such a great job, whether it was bagging their groceries nicely, doing a return, or simply finding something on a shelf.

Walmart taught me how to advance and also that if I put my mind to it, there's nothing I can't do. There was no hard part at work, I did everything required and met all deadlines.

"Decent Pay, Good Customers, Good Experience","The job itself was decent, but overall management lacks alot of ability in communications with their employees. It is understood that management had alot to deal with on their own, however, in communicating these changes and new challenges to their workers we would have been more able to plan to aid more as a community and team. Unfortunetally, the way the store is run it seems it's based more around gossip than fact. Information is passed if it is convenient to the employer, not if it is important and workers felt the result of this justification.However, the job itself was focused, as far as what I was doing there, and the pay was better than other whole-sale jobs found in the area. For that I can say I am grateful and am proud to admit I worked for the company. Also, although there had been quite a lack of communications, I was able to go to management and find out things for myself. Still, as I believe that should not be all my job, it is something I can deal with and am capable of doing so.In conclusion to the review for Walmart, I want to point out the most enjoyable aspect of working for this company. Making new friends at work, putting a smile on my customers faces and developing a sales relationship with them as the customer, made me feel successful and, all together, an asset to the company.",3,Former Employee,Maintenance Associate ,"Fredericksburg, VA",3/19/13,2013,3,19

I have learned how to provide excellent customer service and how to work hard. I have learned the ins and outs of the SMART system, and the inner workings of the company itself. I have carried the weight of department manager duties as a standard associate and I have learned the value of a satisfied customer. I have learned to appreciate the appreciation of others but have also come to understand that most associates at Wal-Mart who are worth appreciating are under-appreciated.Members of management individually at Wal-Mart are really great. However, as a whole, there is a communication gap, especially between levels of management. Oftentimes, an assistant manager will give one direction and then the co-manager will give something completely contrary; likewise for the store manager. There is a glaring disconnect between levels of management that needs to be addressed. If the management team could become unified, then they could accomplish so much more for the store. As is, however, managerial disorganization leads to associate disorganization.

I learned how to use company equipment, help other department because they had to quick train me, plus I learned where everything was.

Im always surprised in the way that fellow associates will comes without being told by management in most cases to help a team member which increases my pride and love of the company from the store level up to the home office level, As with any job there are things that I wish were different or were more in what I feel would be more beneficial to the customer but overall, every associate does their part to provide the best experience possible once they, the customer, walk thru the door. each store stuggles with those providing less than expectation level service - more...",4,Current Employee,Store Shift Manager ,Louisiana,3/12/13,2013,3,12

"Walmart is a Beautiful place to work, for me","At Walmart, I was assigned a department to work in, but that is not the only place I worked. There is a heavy emphasis on the customer. If someone was within 10 feet, I greeted them and ask if they need help. If they are looking for something, I then to took them to the item. Days at Walmart are long. A full-time shift is nine hours. I got two fifteen-minute breaks and a one-hour lunch where I clock out. The break room was always lively, clean, and stocked with good reading material. During my tenure, overtime was almost nonexistent. You were to work during your shift, but make sure you punched out on time. The company wanted to pay you, but didn't want to pay for more than you were scheduled. It made sense. Walmart taught me exactly how to deal with customers, and in my personal life, people, that could be considered difficult to handle. Furthermore, you are encouraged by management to go back to the training room at any time during your employment to use the computers and learn more. They do not count as break time, and associates are paid while using them. However, I also saw the opposite end of the spectrum. Some fellow associates seemed content to do the bare minimum and didn't go anywhere in the company because of it. In fact, they are still at the same level. In my opinion, these are also the employees that you hear speaking negatively of Walmart's employment practices. They want something for nothing from the company and they aren't getting it.

Unfulfilling and undercompensated,"A typical work day would consist of nearly impossible time goals in stifling conditions, often encouraged to increase speed at the risk of worker safety.At one point, it was threatened that we would not be given water while unloading trucks in the middle of summer because we were using too many cups.Overtime was not allowed, and employees would be forced to edit time punches in order to avoid overtime charges.Heavily anti-union, Walmart does not support fair wage practices, or worker safety.",1,Former Employee,Inventory Control Team Associate ,"Vestal, NY",3/11/13,2013,3,11

Some of the management had a good sense of what to do depending on if it was there department not so much if it was another that they had not trained in.Dealing with customers can be very trying at the same time when you have made someone happy with there product and giving a sympathetic ear or shoulder to cry on depending on the situation.",3,Former Employee,Photo Specialist ,"Williston, VT",3/11/13,2013,3,11

Wal-Mart Summary,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was nothing but chaos to say the least. I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know from working with the company prior to my being hired. The management team (or lack there of) was constantly overworking their associates, and constantly wanted people from other departments in other areas to do other peoples jobs when the called out sick or didn't show up etc. The only real teamwork that was ever (sometimes) seen was between the lower associates of the many departments. The hardest part of the job was trying to riddle out what supervisor or manager wanted you to do what, and it got annoying as hell having multiple people telling you what to do over the course of a shift you didn't know what needed prioritizing.",1,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"North Charleston, SC",3/11/13,2013,3,11

The management is always on key and willing to do their part to get their departments in tip top shape.

Fast paced business,"No matter where you work in this company, your speed is very important. I enjoyed working here but was disappointed that I could not transfer to a different work position considering my weight lifting restrictions upon becoming pregnant. I was never in a set area where I stocked. I often ended up with the more complex area that had the tallest and fullest pallets and not enough space to stock them in the department. That was the most challenging part was to complete the numerous of overstocked pallets alone while others had extra employee help. Most of the co-workers were helpful to me when they could and refused to allow me to pull or lift very heavy boxes or pallets. The managers however did not assist me with restrictions except for one manager who was relocated/promoted out of state.

"Overall, not a great place to work","A typical day at work starts with cashiering in one department and later being moved around all over the store without adequate compensation for the added tasks one is required to perform in those different departments. I learned a lot about palette jacks, hand held inventory tracking devices, lifts, printers and other electronics. The store manager is a great guy, but the customer service managers are unreliable and often bitter when they have to help customers. A lot of the other cashiers I met while working for Walmart seemed to be dissatisfied with their jobs as well. The hardest part of the job is the holiday rush. Holiday shoppers are a lot more hostile and impatient than any other time of the year. It can be difficult to maintain a clean, fast, and friendly environment while servicing long lines of customers who each have one to two full shopping carts.

The most enjoyable part of my job is having a job that gives raises and works with my hectic school schedule.,3,Current Employee,Deli Associate ,"Ruidoso, NM",3/9/13,2013,3,9
Productive and effective work plave,Wal-mart was a good company it was just time for me to find a job for what I went to school for that's why I decided to resign.,3,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"West Haven, CT",3/9/13,2013,3,9
A great starting point with opportunities for more,"Having worked there for 2 and a half years, I have learned so much about retail and gained a lot of experience. The management team is very considerate about my being in school and very understanding when it comes to family issues.The hardest part about this job is that unless you have complete scheduling flexibility, your chances of advancing are reduced. I made some great friends in my co-workers and supervisors and got more than just work related advice. I learned some life lessons as well.",4,Current Employee,Sales Associate then Overnight Stocker ,"Plaistow, NH",3/9/13,2013,3,9
Great Place to work at.,"I loved working at Walmart because of the diversity, most of my co-workers are from Africa so we had that bond and respect for each other and everybody was hardworking. The management was really bad.",4,Former Employee,OVERNIGHT STOCKER ,"Columbus, OH",3/9/13,2013,3,9
Negative place to work; very draining emotionally,"There is nothing really positive I can say. I took this job because I couldn't find a job within my degree (sports marketing). When I was going through the application process I was told it was an Assistant Manager position, however that was not the case. After being there less than 3 months I was asked to step down from my position to one that pays less. They say they want to help you, have you learn the skills so you can move up the ladder, but I have been going backwards. You work varying shifts, never have more than two days off which are not the weekend. It takes a toll on your social life. I am currently looking for another position.",2,Current Employee,Zone Supervisor ,"Terre Haute, IN",3/9/13,2013,3,9
Great place to work if you dont want to move up,At the Walmart I work at its nearly impossible to move up. I pushed carts for 3 years before I was able to simply move in the store to electronics. Many employees never get the opportunity to advance.,4,Current Employee,Electronic Sales Associate ,"Commerce, GA",3/9/13,2013,3,9
Productive atmosphere,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart however, the rate of pay does not match the work experience. Management in Wal-Mart are trained to be robots, meaning they do not allow management to think for themselves",2,Former Employee,"Optical, Vision Center, Pharmacy Techniction ","Apache Junction, AZ",3/9/13,2013,3,9
"Walmart is an okay job,but I have skilled training that I am serious and ready to use, I want to continually grow more by praticing my certifications","A typical day at work I swipe my badge to see my daily tasks and area coverage,grab returns,help customers,stock,zone shelves,put up overstock,bin and pick merchandise,be a back up cashier,work on projects,cut fabric and blow up balloons.I learned at Wal-Mart the value of making someone smile,how it can change your day and theirs.Working their I have refined my people skills and problem solving.Management some are great,and others aren't very proffessional or helpful.Although You learn so much from your co-workers.The hardest part of the job is not being able to use my Medical Clinical Lab Assistant and Phlebotomy Skills.The most Enjoyable part of my job is the customers.",3,Current Employee,Sales Associate ,"Saint Petersburg, FL",3/8/13,2013,3,8

"tedious work, impersonal management, low pay and almost impossible to get full time",I was on track for a promotion by one Co-Manager until she was promoted to run her own store. Shortly after the management change their were several under qualified employees promoted and morale dropped greatly,2,Former Employee,stocker ,"Bakersfield, CA",3/8/13,2013,3,8
"Stable dependable, and reliable workplace","The most difficult aspect of this job was adjusting to working in the freezer so often. Typically my day started by making a list of inventory to put out on the floor, then pull out the merchandise from the freezer and stock the main floor in the bakery/deli department. For the most part I got along really well with my co-workers and management as I am very much a people person and can work with just about anyone. The one thing I learned about this position is that you either need to already come with a tough skinned body and mindset or you need to learn to develop one very quickly. However, my most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the different customers each and every day. I enjoyed hearing about their needs and doing what I was able to do to get those needs met. That is what made my job enjoyable.",4,Former Employee,Baker/Deli Assoc. ,"Crawfordville, FL",3/8/13,2013,3,8
Fine working experience,"Good company overall, but all employees are overworked and undervalued, including lower management.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Knoxville, TN",3/8/13,2013,3,8
Busy Energetic most of the time.,"A day at walmart usually go's well, fun energetic, always busy,putting returns and stock up, zoneing, making the store look presentable, but most importantly delivering the best customer service possible. I have learned you have to treat each customer according to their needs. Help each other out at busy times. management is something to be desired, they could be a little more appreciative, and more respectful to the underlings that make the store what it is. point out the positive and not just the negative. The co-workers are great they come together when things need to be done, friendly environment. The best part is making the customer happy knowing that you were the one that satisfied them with wat they were looking for, i dont think there was a difficult time at work, except when us floor associates get called up to be on the register when the cashiers are overwhelmed, so we have to work harder to catch up on our work.",3,Former Employee,Customer Service Specialist ,"Sterling Heights, MI",3/8/13,2013,3,8
Worst job ever,The management for this company varies because some are really nice and work with you but others are entirely rude and useless.,2,Former Employee,Overnight Cashier ,"Dallas, TX",3/8/13,2013,3,8
Walmart,"Most days are pretty routine. The system assigns the associates a specific register to maintain and operate.

typical day at work,just a job. people there had allot of drama including manager,4,Former Employee,Cook / Deli worker ,"Prairieville, LA",3/8/13,2013,3,8
Happy Workplace where the customer comes first,A typical day at work would be fast paced. I learned to not allow other co-workers to affect my work ethic. Management had its times where they had their favorites but if I stayed on my job and did what I was asked and supposed to do I didnt have any complaints or worries. The hardest part of working for Wal-Mart would have to be the customers. Some of them really knew how to give a cashier a hard time but with a smile it can help you move on with your day without showing any signs of frushtration. The most enjoyable part of the job woud be talking with new people everyday and working on a team that cares about how the performance of the job matters.,3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Dayton, OH",3/8/13,2013,3,8

The easiest is working with others who want to learn as much as you do .",5,Current Employee,cashier ,"Bastrop , La",3/8/13,2013,3,8
Excellent Place to Work,"From my experience at Walmart, I learned a number of different things that still help me to this day. Things that have molded me in to a better overall retail associate. The only problem with the job was the management style, in any given day you had four to five people you would answer to that all had differing opinions on what you should be doing. Sometimes it literally came down to completing a task one manager had given you, to have another manager come along and make you re-do or completely change said task. My co-workers are some of the best people I've ever met, and to this day I am still very close friends with many of them.",5,Former Employee,Sporting Goods Sales Associate ,"Fort Wayne, IN",3/8/13,2013,3,8
Great work experience if your into the security field,"If your into the security field, being a Wal-Mart Asset Protection Associate will give you experience. You will learn how to monitor and keep close surveillance on any suspicious activities from customers and employees. You will make cases with the police department and assist you with the apprehension when needed. Best moment working as an AP is when you help customers locating their stolen belongings from another customer and you assist them. Also assisting the police department with video surveillance on catching the criminals from the crimes they committed or if they are looking for them.",4,Current Employee,Assets Protection Associate ,"Salinas, CA",3/8/13,2013,3,8

Very Open workplace and challenging,"The typical day at walmart neighborhood market consisted of long hours and great customers. Managers were always busy so the quick and effectiveness was limited. It is a big company so there were not very many co-workers that you knew. I think that the most enjoyable moments while working at Wal-Mart had to be the great customers.

Great friendly environment.,"My day consisted of helping customers and talking to them like a friend. My daily routine very simply was to clean and restock produce and help my co-workers after I finished my tanks at hand. There are many things the average person doesn't realize about the clean and fresh produce they have readily available for them to choose from at walmart. Keeping the temperature, lighting, humidity and airflow is vital in order to keep the produce from ripening to fast and turning rancid. Walmart donates the produce that is close to its SBD (sell by date) to "" Feed America "". What walmart can not sell or donate goes into organic compost and sold to hog farms as feed. There is no hard part about working for walmart. When you need help, you have plenty of friendly coworkers or managers to help.

I believe at one time Walmart would have been the ideal place to work.,From the start of the day after clocking in the stress begins. We are always short-handed and never given any help from other departments. Yet we are required to assist in other areas of the store regardless of the fact that there are not enough people in the shop to properly follow procedures and protocol. Our immediate supervisors have no problem helping out although those higher than they are insist that they don't.

fun to work with other associates,i would come in and start by inventorying the back room and then take the information given to me on my hand held and restock the sales floor.

The management at Wal-Mart are kind and fair while holding the employees to goals and expectations that strive for excellence in customer service.In a typical day I help customers check out with their purchases, answer questions, assist customers in finding what they want. I often return stock to shelves that has been discarded by customers. I check expiration dates on items stocked near my register and rotate stock so that merchandise stays fresh. I clean and sanitize my area, fill in while other employees take their breaks and basically do whatever is needed to provide our customers with the best shopping experience possible.",4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Coffeyville, KS",3/6/13,2013,3,6

Was a job that I put in a hard day at.,Some of the the co-workers were great to work with others did not want to work as a team but wanted to put off everything on others causing them to not be able to get their own work down especially when it came to some of the department managers. I also did not like the fact that you work and do your job and yet you did not get recognized for the work you did because others especially department managers took the credit for things they did not do. I had a bad experience with company. I am sure that other department managers did not act the same way but the experience I had was not good. I will say that store management work well when you had family emergencies and understood. Also I loved the fact that you could limit your availabilty so you could attend church and they stuck to it and did not expect you to come in on the days you were not avaiable.,3,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate ,"Mobile, AL",3/6/13,2013,3,6

Walmart,"Throughout my career in customer service, I have found that there is no such thing as a typical day. Either working as a waitress or a customer service manager you occasionally run across customer who are unhappy. One thing I have had to learn, is that when a person is upset because of something or someone else, they just need someone to genuinely listen to them, and try to find a solution to fix their problem. I do have to say that a situation like this is the hardest and most satisfying part in customer service. I personally enjoy defusing the upset person because I show them that I truly care. The disappointment comes from the lack of quality from a product or a employee's ruddiness that represents the company I stand for.Dealing with management and co-workers, can be a great thing and a bad thing. From what I've seen, some people just can't get along, personalities just don't fit. Though, in the work place environment you should always act professional! I would hate going into a store and seeing two employees arguing. This just looks bad for the company, and I personally would not continue to shop there. I am a firm believer in that everyone should be treated as I would like to be treated. This is why I respect others, care for their needs, and defuse the issue to the best of my abilities.",5,Former Employee,COSTUMER SERVICE MANAGER ,"Lexington, SC",3/6/13,2013,3,6

Lovely place to work,"Wokring at walmart was a very difficult but also fun job. You learn new people. You see what each person buys everyday, thru out the week. Any day at walmart was a very busy day. I worked in the morning the same shift Monday-Friday 6:30am-4pm Saturday-Sunday would be any shift available. The management in the morning was the best because everything wasn't so rushed or at a fast pace. They weren't to busy to come to your register to count or exchange out any merchandise you needed. My co-workers were like neighbors next door. We all worked hard for the money we earned. We all had our moments of laughter,cries & sad days. But we came in did what we all had to do and worried about other things outside of work. There wasn't any real hard part working for walmart honestly, the worse thing that could possibly happen to you at walmart is having someone else work you register and something so happens to come up and your shorter than what you were before your shift started. You cant trust everyone that works on your register because they may have someone they know come shorten your draw and that along will put you in a waddle of mess.

The hours are 3:30am to 12:00pm, which is hard to deal with and maintain a normal life with a family that needs your time and attention during ""normal"" daytime hours. This, and the near hour drive from my home are why I give it one star for work/life balance. Once you complete training and gain a decent knowledge base, it is rather easy to get promoted to assistant management position, but this almost always requires relocation to another warehouse- usually in another state- which can also be hard to do with a family.",4,Current Employee,Quality Control Inspector ,"Monroe, GA",3/5/13,2013,3,5

Receiving closes and you can finish your paperwork and clean up your area of empty pallets etc. Lunch for an hour. Back to receiving after lunch to see if there are any late vendors that need you. Prep milk credits to go out the following morning. Shrink wrap that pallet. Enter milk credits in computer. Make sure all your paperwork has been finished and then file it in the UPC office. Take one last look out back. Make sure all is clean and organized behind the store in your receiving area. Lock up and clock out.,3,Former Employee,Receiver ,VA,3/5/13,2013,3,5

My pay was dropped almost $2.00, I was put in a cashier position instead of customer service and for almost a week straight I would get off work when I was supposed to, but none of my managers acknowledged me as I was leaving. I felt unappreciated.

I've learned to give excellent customer service and to handle myself well under stress. All of my co-workers are great people and we work great together.The hardest part of the job is keeping my scans per hour up.The most enjoyable part is getting to talk to a bunch of different people and working with good coworkers",5,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Springfield, MO",3/5/13,2013,3,5

Fast paced outbound call center focusing on sales and quota.,"A typical workday started with being introduced to the script and product of the day for what we would be calling customers about (service, subscription, etc.). After being introduced we would be given a few minutes to read over the paperwork before starting to call people to inform them of what they were being offered. After lunch there would be a short meeting to see what was working and what was helping to sell more or less. The co-workers were always trying to help each other in order to obtain the sales quota needed and to achieve bonuses for individuals and for the company as a whole. The hardest part of the job was learning how to take the objective and criticism from some people about telemarketing but the best part of job was getting to talk to so many people.

Not the greatest place to work,"I worked 32 hours a week. I was Customer Service Supervisor two days out of the four days I worked there, and never got paid for doing it. I got regular pay. I was never late, but when I got my evaluation there were 26 abscences for being tardy. The manager that did my evaluation knew I was never late because he was always there when I worked. When I would ask for days off months in advance I never received them. I was there almost two years, and I would come in to work when it was my day off if someone called in, but never got acknowledged for it.

I'm seeking a full-time, day warehousing position with benefits. I'm pleased to work weekends and overtime. I've enjoyed working with my co-workers and management, but believe it's time to move to a company that offers 40 hours consistently and desire working a day shift.",3,Current Employee,warehouse assistant ,"Porter Ranch, CA",3/4/13,2013,3,4
"Love the people I work with, but there are issues","I really do love the people I work with at Wal-mart. From management to entry level associates. We are all a family and we all care about each other, which makes working there a lot easier. The main problem I have with the company (and it may just be my store) is some of the poor decisions they make.For example being told to start a task, and then be two hours into it and they come and tell you that they don't want you to do that anymore and instead want you to do something else.Also, at least at my store, there is so much merchandise in the backroom that is no longer active, meaning it does not have a place on the sales floor. The common sense solution (in my mind) is to mark the merchandise down, 20, 30 or even 50%, and put it on carts up front to sell it. I feel it is better to make some money on an item than to have it sit in the back, taking up space and making no money. But it seems to me and most other associates at my store that the emphasis is making sure that the store looks nice and organized over making money. I feel this is a poor choice of importance on the part of management.",4,Current Employee,Inventory Control ,"Franklin, TN",3/4/13,2013,3,4
"Normal through out, difficult at times","A typical day at work is handling your job performance. I learned how to maintain everything that needed to be handled in the store, buffing, stripping, and making sure the building is presentable. Management preferred perfection under certain conditions, that I met to the best of my ability. I got along with many of the coworkers. I was a leader and advised them in certain situations. The hardest part of the job could be all of thee above. Turning Walmart into the super center that it was supposed to be can be a challenging task.

I try very hard to take good care of the associates that work under me because they feel under-appreciated every day. The hardest part of my job is working freight everyday (50 lb boxes). I was hired to be a merchandiser, not a stocker and I have not been able to use my skills to their potential. The best part of my job is helping my customers find what they need daily.

I was hired in November and laid off at the end of December. I wasn't given any notice of my lay off either. I feel as though when a company asks for a two week notice when an employee is getting done then they should give a two week notice to the employee when they are gonna lay them off so that they have enough time to begin looking for a job.

I consider that fair. I know community pharmacist often times do not get an increase each and every year.The stock options are good. I went to work at a nice salary. They gave me 3 weeks paid vacation the first year. You are given personal days off.

The routine walk through would be to point out any safety hazards or anything that needed to be locked up that wasn'tI learned how to type very detailed reports on theft cases that we would have. Checking fire exits and properly updating their statuses. Documenting everything and making sure the correct people get notes on what needs to be done and by when.Management at Wal-Mart are awesome. I loved every single one of them. They are very helpful and are there for more than just work issues.I basically only had one co-worker, besides my boss. She is a very hard worker and is serious about her job. She became one of my best friends. She taught me mostly everything I know and she is one of the main people who made me succeed in my job as Asset Protection.The hardest part of the job was figuring thefts out. For example, trying to foresee if there would run from you when you would approach them at the exit. Almost having to mind read them. Also, the approach itself. My partner and I would put our lives on the line with every approach. We had no idea what these thief's where like, much less know if maybe there were carrying weapons.

"A Job, not a Career","I am greatful for the experience I have gained while working at Walmart. A typical day is quite busy and sometimes frustrating. We are stretched to get a lot done with not enough time or resources or pay. I believe their is not enough staff to get the job done right. I have learned that I have to get what I can done and let the frustrations of stress that comes with it go away. Management has had its ups and downs. I have seen good managers come and turn bitter and leave the company. I have seen some bad managers also get better and change. I love most of my co-workers as they are the reason I look forward to coming to work. The ones I have worked with have helped me to change my attitude about situations and I have helped them do the same. The hardest part of my job are the schedule as with all retail, it is not a ""9 to 5"" job but whenever they need you.

Economy has had a bad effect on Walmart and how it treats their employees.,"Short Staffed leads to short tempers, which leads to an unpleasant experience for employees and customers. I was fortunate to work in the Cash Office. Although this dept. has it's own stress levels it was still where I would prefer to be. The management over the front-end was not very forth coming and this made things difficult. I helped train my co-workers and enjoyed all I did. The hardest part of the job was picking up after an employee left with no indication of what and where to begin. Example would be filing system of old documents and labeling.

Pros and Cons Weigh it out,"Work is typically busy, non stop. I have been an hourly employee and a salaried employee. Each and every job had it challenges and very few days were like any others. My co-workers have always been great people. I have never had an issue with any of my co-workers. As far as management, there is a lot of micro-management. What hourly associates don't see is that as each management level increases, the amount of micromanagement you encounter is compounded. So when you feel like your being micromanaged, its usually due to their boss managing them. There is little trust in the company anymore and even less empowerment. On the positive side, if your willing to work hard and long, there is countless opportunity for advancement. That included keeping your complaints to yourself and not challenging authority. Sometimes you have to swallow your pride and realize the bigger picture is worth dealing with whats in front of you. The hardest parts of the job is dealing with the over abundance of change initiatives. Every officer of the company wants their brand on the next big procedure nd half of them don't last a full year.",3,Current Employee,Asset Protection Coordinator Manager ,Indiana,2/28/13,2013,2,28
