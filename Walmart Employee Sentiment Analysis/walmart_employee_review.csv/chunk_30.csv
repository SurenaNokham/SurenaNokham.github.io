"good place to work, many breaks","When working at Wal-mart, you get hired as a part time employee. You usually get around 25 hours a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. You get a $1 raise when you finish a series of training but that takes months. You get bonuses when you work a certain amount of hours and when you're done with training. You get a paid 15 minute break after every 2 hours worked and an unpaid 1 hour lunch break after 4 hours worked. Some locations have parties for the employees during the summer and Christmas. However, lots of employees have their hours cut throughout most of the year. Benefits are only for full time employees which are not being hired at the moment.",4,Former Employee,Sales Associate/ Cashier ,"Del Rio, TX",3/26/17,2017,3,26

"Different day, different chores","At first it was a job to pay the bills, but soon it turned into what could only be described as a cow farm and all the cows have gone mad. Either mad customers during the holidays or management never being on the same page. The manager wants one thing, and then two other mangers want another, so you end up doing 5 things, only to turn around and do what the first manager wanted to begin with.",2,Former Employee,Garden Center Cashier ,"Texarkana, TX",3/26/17,2017,3,26
Mediocre job,It is a stable job. It comes with very little excitement and job duties are always consistent and repetitive. Not everyone who works there is very friendly so co working isn't always the best experience.,3,Former Employee,Customer Service Associate ,"Knoxville, TN",3/26/17,2017,3,26

"Must be tough, flexible & sweet to work at Walmart","The first week working at Walmart was great.  As time progressed people began to reveal their real character.  Again I love working with the public but arguments & petty fights only got worse over the next 7 months by the 7th month July a certain few turned on me.  Anytime management permits workers to argue, nick pick & point fingers on a daily basis eventually the work environment will sour.  Either a person takes on the same trait or suffer the consequences. I don't remember any of those people being my siblings so No I'm like any of them. Alberta was hired to do a job & to be compensated as Alberta. I don't come from that kinda work environment so things didn't go well by the 7th month.",2,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"South Hill, VA",3/26/17,2017,3,26

Great work environment,"A typical work day was making sure the cashiers had their scheduled breaks and lunches on time. I provided friendly customer service to customers that came into the store. I learned how to conduct job interviews, managed the daily work schedule of the cashiers, managed the customer service desk, and communicated with other managers throughout the store. The hardest part of the job was not having enough cashiers throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers resolve their issues they had with their merchandise and hearing positive reviews from customers.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Supervisor ,"San Antonio, TX",3/26/17,2017,3,26

Good place to work especially if you are single. You'll spend your whole week mostly at work,"Walmart would be a suitable job if you are single. Because you will spend a lot of time at work, and you will have little time for family. Depending on the associates performance, they can remove your second day off. You'll work a minimum of 12-18hrs a day. They can change your schedule without you knowing within 24hrs.

Great in CO,"Loved the job in CO, felt appreciated, regular raises, great management, no problem with having a steady schedule.

Management,"I can only speak for myself and the store that I currently work at, but I do not like working at Walmart because of management.

On top of pulling heavy freight, we also are given pallet jacks that are a strain on the body and most of them are broken. Another reason to stay away is that some of the managers do not care about the employees and are quick to either write them up or fire them. I have been written up before, but I let my supervisor and co-workers know that I wasn't having a good day.",2,Current Employee,IMS Associate ,"Winston-Salem, NC",3/25/17,2017,3,25

Fun place to be around co-workers,"Everyone who works at Walmart, from my experience, are some of the nicest people I have met. My favorite part of work is being able to ask them how they're doing, how is the family. My least favorite part of a day is when I don't have enough coverage during the busiest hours, but one way or another I always get it done, with help from management or solving it myself.

caused me serious anxiety problems,This job was exhausting and caused me severe anxiety. I would frequently get distressed and dizzy at work and need to sit down and nobody would come help me. They would leave me up front with up to 15 customers in one line. I'm older now so I could probably handle the job better now. Their pay at the time was awful.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Bartlesville, OK",3/25/17,2017,3,25

Do not put open availability for the love of god,The person in charge up front at the moment as an assistant manager at my Walmart will treat you like a child. They have other coworkers tattling on eachother and if you switch jobs they don't actually compensate during your two weeks they just say they are then you have to miss the last week cuz both jobs are scheduled the same. They don't normally give you a regular schedule. I bet if you worked in a different department then cashier it would be perfectly fine when it comes to management. There's just new management that is very difficult to deal with in the cashier department. The actual coworkers you have are very nice though and no matter what department you will have good people to work with. It's just the main female boss up front you have to worry about.,2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"7010 Auburn Blvd, Citrus Heights, CA 95621",3/25/17,2017,3,25

Horrible Work Environment,"The skill level required for this job are very minimal. The work is repetitive and very easy to learn. At the location where I was employed there was a lot of favoritism and very little chance for advancement. Even with multiple praises from customers I was not recognized, neither formally or informally but one time. You are told there is room for advancement and current employees will be given first consideration in open positions, this could not be further from the truth. The most likely person to receive a new position is whomever management likes best, nothing is based on qualifications, ability or whatever aptitude you may have that could benefit the store if you were put in a hypothetical position. With the exception of two managers the rest were rude, condescending and treated workers as if they were meant to serve them personally in an almost slave-like position. Yelling and just a general sense of unprofessional behavior are expected to be a part of everyday life at this particular Wal*mart supercenter.",1,Former Employee,Cashier-Front End ,"Springfield, OH Tuttle Rd.",3/25/17,2017,3,25

Dormant Talent,"In general, the people with whom I worked brought a multitude of skills and talent to the organization, made it enjoyable to work at Walmart. Because the work culture was ""Top-Down"" and ""tightly controlled,"" there was a failure to extract maximum benefit from the major success determinant of successful teamwork -- collaborative communication. Fortunately, the Organization placed a high value on customers, however attempts to limit brand choices failed to meet expectations of many patrons.",3,Former Employee,Accounting Associate ,"Commerce, GA",3/25/17,2017,3,25

Poor management system,The current store that I work in has very poor management skills over all from the top down nothing is done on time so when it comes time to do tasks everything is rushed and people get hurt and things get destroyed. There is no real training for anything people are just put some where and told to figure it out i would not recommend working for this store,4,Current Employee,Asset Protection/Customer service specialist ,"Freehold, NJ",3/25/17,2017,3,25
productive easy going hardworking workplace,I would clock in and either go to the cash register up front or stocking the cold departments.  I learned that there are different types of people that can cause all kinds of trouble when they do not get their way on prices.  Management was open and responsive to outraged customers.  Management would communicate openly with the employees and answer questions quickly about the work place.  The hardest part of the job was assisting rude customers.  The best part was getting to associate with various people and help them find products within the store.

Fun Workplace,Working at Wal-Mart was most definitely an experience being that it was such a major cooperation & large store you'll for the most part always have something to. With the management you'll rarely if ever catch them not busy so it was difficult at times to try & speak with them about work related issues I've recently was informed that they did increase the pay which was one of my concerns at the time of being employed there because not only me but a lot of employees felt over worked & under payed. But besides that my experience there was good for the most part.,4,Former Employee,Courtesy Associate ,"Columbia, SC",3/21/17,2017,3,21

"Good pay, hard work",The work it self is not bad.  Definitely get the impression that lower management is only out to make themselves look good.   They constantly put the people that don't make rate in easier positions while others get worked harder.  All this does is burn out those that can do the work at the required level and they end up transferring to a different area or quitting.,3,Current Employee,Loader ,"Mankato, MN",3/21/17,2017,3,21

Horrible job,"They expect too much from you. Management always thinks it's easy to make production but they've never done it. You can miss making production by .2 percent And still be accountable for it. Job isn't for everyone. Got to be constantly moving like you drink coffee the whole time you are there. Its physically demanding and Really exhausting. They give you 2 days of training then you are on your own from that point on. You have to teach yourself how to do the job because 2 days is not long enough! The production rate is unreasonable and the size of the store order matters!! They'll try and tell you it doesn't, but it really does.",2,Former Employee,Non-Con Order Filler ,"Marcy, NY",3/21/17,2017,3,21

"Good Job, Great People","Walmart is a great place to work. Co-workers and Managers were all mostly approachable and they were all ready to help teach me something if I had a question. Cashiering was a good job and it went by fast on the busy days. I loved doing return carts and re-stocking the shelves because if a customer approached me I would be able to  help them find what they were looking for, an alternative, and maybe even make them smile. It was a fun job and I would recommend it to anyone.

Everything you need is right here,"Everything you need is all in one stop. Who wants to keep going places and burning gas? Everything cost, so lets spend it the right way.

great company dependent on the store,"This is a great company to work for, has some really good values and beliefs as long as it is adhered to by management.

Would have loved to stay!,The deli manager has no idea what he is doing and has no experience doing a scheduale which is the reason I utimitally quit.

Typical Retail Job,"Wal-Mart asked a lot of its employees for little. They provided training, but never offered compensation for new skills acquired.

Not really a great company to work for,"After working here for 8 years, I have experienced so much!  I learned that even though you will work so hard and give up your own family time (holidays) to the company, it really isnt appreciated.

Pay is good,"I enjoyed my paychecks from walmart but if youre a new hire..you have to come to conclusions that you are now a slave for walmart. Barely free time, and please dont miss any days of work. The management barely cares about you, because you can be easily replaced depending on where you work so its best to stay to yourself. The pay is good, breaks are reasonable when the manager remembers and its a very fast paced environment.",2,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Fruitland, MD",3/20/17,2017,3,20
prepare to work,"working for Walmart is for work life for single people who don't go out. I would say. The pay is worth some of the problems you go through. Management can get a little difficult to work with but you have to stand firm and be persistent. Walmart in general is a hectic, multi tasking , headache of a job. There are always pros and cons to working any job and meeting new people or having regular customers is always a joy to me. I would say not being able to set your own schedule would be problem for most. If you consider working for a Walmart company my advice to deal with customers is to smile, through the good and bad and tell them to have a PEACHY day.",4,Former Employee,Customer Service Manager ,"Irmo, SC",3/20/17,2017,3,20

While some of the management is questionable, I try to never let it impact my performance. Always giving 100%, the hardest part of my job would have to be remaining clam in stressful situations. For example, managers who don't are not particularily fond of you or customers who have had a bad day can make things difficult. Although the upside is a sense of independence and a strong sense of community within the store. People always depending on you to get the job done and fellow employees always willing to help whenever possible.",4,Current Employee,Garden Center Associate & Front End Cashier ,"Duncan, OK",3/20/17,2017,3,20

There are so many assistant managers, so when you communicate with one it's like you didn't communicate with anyone. But I did move up quickly and wasn't even trying to.

Okay place to work some co-workers are great.,"My typical work day depending on the shift I work, morning shift 7-4 I start off opening the store pre- slicing meat for the meat case, putting pans in the hot case and turning the hot case on. Putting rotisserie chicken in the oven. I also put the cold salads in new containers and make new salads that we ran out of the night before. Then if I work the 9-6 I start frying the food for the hot case, and taking the rotisserie chickens out to put in the lower hot case. And put more in about an hour later. I help our customers get whatever they desire from what we have. If I work the closing shift 2-11, I would help customers and fry food as needed. At 6 pm I would shut the fryers down for the night and clean them, and once a week we clean our fryers. I would then start taking expired foods and salads out of the salad case and hot case. I would also take the pre sliced meat out of meat case. Do dishes and clean slicers and get ready to close. Then call for a manager and get inspected. What I have learned from working here, if you have a problem don't go to your manager you need to go way above there heads because nothing is ever done when going through them. A few manager could care less about their job so they are very rude to their employees. What I have learned is to keep on your toes and do just your job and if you see something wrong write down day, time, and what had happened and show your higher management. There are a bunch of Managers that are AMAZING and would do anything to make their employees happy which is very nice.

working in the store was fun but stressfull,"the work load as a Walmart employee was not usually too hard to handle, the main issue I had as a Walmart employee was management. the management ladder was horrible because you would have your shift manager and they sucked at positive communication. most of the employees were hard workers doing as much as they could as fast as they could, yes there were the few that where lazy and slow but for the most part everyone pulled there own. management spent most of there time criticizing the pace that we got things done even though most of the time it was still being done faster than standards, it didn't help that they had there own bosses breathing down there necks telling them that they were not doing good enough, not getting enough sales, that the shelves were not zoned well enough. the reality of it was tat there was too much stuff and not enough staff. if they would have just been more positive with us the work environment would have been a lot better.",2,Former Employee,Various Positions ,"Macclenny, FL",3/12/17,2017,3,12

Poor,"Walmart is the defenition of overworked and under appreciated. They give you an un-realistic amount of time to get work done. IE. if the job in the computer says it takes 4 hours to unload a truck by hand they want it done in 2. However if it isn't done in 2 hours all the managers come in and start pressuring the employees. For example unloading the truck pulling freight out onto the floor to be stocked, stocking said freight, and facing the product, all together per the walmart computer system says it takes 10-12 hours, They want it all done in 8. If you don't get it done in that time there is always a supervisor or manager saying you have to stay late until its done.

I actually applied for sales floor and stocking.  they just ended up placing me in as a cashier because of my politeness and friendliness.

He was uncaring and if he didn't like you he would work to get rid of you, although if you were a cute young girl he would overturn any attendance issues or coachings so he could keep flirting.

Unfortunately the training while I was there for new associates was pretty bad they just throw you at the work and if you can squeeze it in you can do 15 minutes of required time put in to advance in a computer training program. Some of the time there were too many managers and they didn't communicate with each other well so I was given one instruction and then another overriding the previous instruction.

My managers in both departments were also understanding of my family's needs and were willing to work with me on scheduling! They were family oriented and I loved that aspect. I loved my customers, and staying busy so the day didn't drag by. This would've been my ideal first job, but I feel like I did better after gaining some prior work experience.

Overnight Stocker,Overnight stocker position is a challenging position if you are a good worker. If you are a bad worker they tend to give you some slack by putting you in easy departments with another associate. Management is too focus on clearing out the back rooms any way possible that at the end jeopardizes the way the store looks. The stores would perform better if they would make all associates work instead of counting on a handful of individuals. I once asked why do we have so many slackers and there response was that we need the bodies. To me that response does not motivate anyone to work harder especially if you can do have the work of the harder working individuals and get paid the same. When working at a Walmart store you need to make sure they give you time to complete pathways as this is a way a store gets away from giving you your bonuses.,3,Current Employee,OVERNIGHT STOCKER ,"Duarte, CA",3/8/17,2017,3,8

Departmentalization gives small company feel,"Working in the pharmacy, you get to know regular patients, prescribers, and co-workers well.

Connexus system is very user friendly; wish you had internet access though to help resolve insurance issues and help with patient care/therapy. While most pharmacists are great to work with and allow you autonomy to efficiently do your part in helping patients, a few treat you like you're too unintelligent to even have a conversation with them about the weather and expect you to do everything for them like a servant rather than work as a team.

Walmart poor management,"Management was not professional as they should of been.They favor a lot which made associate struggle.

Apart from our regular job during Christmas season our department is in charge of layaway. Unfortunately the layaway system isn't the greatest and that made my job more difficult because we would lose half the customer items and some of those item we couldn't replace. Packages that came from shipment were to much and there was no room to put them so we would also lose those packages. The store manager could of cared less when she would see us struggle and when we tried to talk to her about solution to make our job easier she wouldn't listen. Half the time we would get in trouble and in my opinion it wasn't fair because there wasn't much we could do with little help they would give us.

The Days Blend,"Walmart is a place that loves complete submission.

There are only so many days you can expect us to work at full capacity with a fourth of the staff we are supposed to have on hand in a day. _x000D__x000D_The hardest part of the job is getting up to go in. Knowing that the minute you walk in before you have even set down your bag you will be harassed about the departments short comings makes it very difficult to want to go in at all. The only thing to keep me going is the thought of change to come and the loyalty to my department members. _x000D__x000D_The best part of the job is by far - handing the cakes to the customers.

"Walmart: A Great Place to Visit, But Not To Live","One of the things I really liked about working for Walmart was that there was a fixed routine, so you never really had to wait around to get started, and there was always something to do.  It was a great way to hone interpersonal skills and problem solve.  Management was a bit iffy, just because any authority was so divided, you had to go to the really high up members of management to get anything resolved.  Most people you got to work with were friendly enough, there's always a couple grouchy people in any job.  The difficult part of the job was the insane turnover rate, you basically lost and filled someone in every department at least once a month, often more frequently.   I liked having flexibility in my work schedule, and that I was free to handle things as I saw fit.",4,Former Employee,Stocker ,"Lafayette, CO",3/6/17,2017,3,6

I also enjoyed my coworkers; I liked to arrive early in order to visit with them before actually clocking in.  I didn't consider any part of my job difficult; I liked new challenges.  However, corporate management could make things difficult at times: an example would be taking a sick day to go to the doctor.  The doctor would have to fill-out a long form concerning the visit.

The only real issue was the severe lack of communication between higher management and associates. It would come up off that there had been a sudden policy change, new program or even adjustment with little to no notice. In the case of the most recent Nintendo switch, it was advertised as a pre-order product and nobody was even informed of the process in which to do so. I had to hunt down management and find all the information that ""I should have already gotten"" or ""Should know what I'm doing by now"" despite this being the first console pre-order that ended up not even being taken care of by the electronics department, but by Garden Center. In short, I love the people and the work was more than tolerable, but Walmart needs to make some serious adjustments to the way they treat their employees.",3,Former Employee,Electronics/Wireless Associate ,"Lima, OH",3/5/17,2017,3,5

Keep in mind that whenever you go into any Walmart, you tend to only see a handful of people working in which that shows how busy they stay! So customer service is already starting on a bad note! Now keep in mind that there is also at least 4 managers there at all times and exactly how often do you see them?

Its a job..,There's nothing special about this place... Some managers are great to work for and can make the overall experience almost enjoyable.

Wal-Mart Review,"In a typical day I normally work on helping customers by slicing their meat and cheese. I do my best to make every customer have a go time and want to come back to the deli. Over the year I have worked with Wal-Mart I have learned a great number of things, I have learned how to operate slicers, rotisserie ovens, and fryers. Some of the management is good while others don't really know how to talk to people. Wal-Mart have a diverse culture. The hardest part of the job is trying to do what everyone asks you to do.

Produce is great but Walmart itself is not,There are customers that are very degrading but there are also customers that are uplifting. The management is more worried about themselves rather than their employees and the customers.

Basically signed my life away but sometimes the pay was worth it.,"As an overnight CSM I didn't do too much other than making sure customers were happy and the stockers got all the freight on the shelves. Very simple job, worth the pay, great benefits. Very affordable insurance. Dealing with the day time management was never fun though. Lack of communication and overall rude attitudes lead to a very poorly run establishment. Everybody on the night shift was very easy going for the most part, not too much drama. Typical day would be to come in at 10 pm, no cashiers and the evening CSM already left. I have to clean and ensure the customers get rung up quickly while also helping other customers on the self-checkouts. Before midnight I would make sure that any extra registers were checked into the money recycler and take the money out of the lottery machine. At midnight I would switch over the registers and self-checkouts to start the new business day. Throughout the night I would stock the register aisles, get the carts inside, and put up any re-shop that I found. If the managers needed me to do anything for them, such as stocking or zoning, I would do that for them. Around 3 am I would get an hour for lunch. Around 6 am the first cashier would show up and I would either have them get directly on a register or they would go help finish zoning. I would get off at 7 am, go home, eat, sleep, shower, then go back in at 10 pm. I worked 5 days in a row with 2 days off after. Tuesdays and Wednesdays became my weekend. The hardest part would be that I never got to see my family or friends because I was always sleeping when they were awake.

"You're getting paid for it, at least","The programs you use on the computer to do your job are not user friendly or in any way intuitive at all.

The attitude is that if you happen to help the customer over the course of your call, then good for you.  If not, so be it.  This leads to customers that have to call back and wait the hour-plus to talk to you time and again who get angrier and angrier when each time they are told something different and nothing ever solves their problem._x000D__x000D_You have a 9 hour shift with your legally-mandated minimum of a 30 minute lunch break, which given the location of the building, makes it impossible to leave in order to eat without extended lunch.

Good company with good benefits and pay a the cost of most of your personal freedom,"Walmart Logistics is a good company. Lots of benefits, management was good at least in my personal experience, and there was a lively culture there I've never experienced before. The only downside is that the nature of your job leaves little room for job/work life balance because you work longer hours than anticipated and you will often be so exhausted that at least one of your days off will be sacrificed to rest. Besides my days off, I never found time to do anything meaningful during my workdays because I would be soaking up as much rest from the moment I left work to the moment I woke up to go to work again. That's subjective, though.

An Experience,"Working at the company gave me the opportunity to learn my craft well and to help the everyday consumer. It's a great company for anyone looking for a start. However, I would not advise anyone to stay with them long-term as work/life balance will continue to remain an issue. From experience, there's the culture the company thinks it portrays and then there's the real side of it. On the bright side, you feel an attachment to the work you do because deep down you know that it helps the person in the store to do their job which trickles down to benefiting the customer.

Awesome fast paced work and plenty of opportunities to advance,I loved the fast paced work experience of being a cashier at Walmart.

I felt like certain csms would do their job really well and I liked working with them but when other csms came in who don't know what their doing and aren't very organized work felt hecktic. And it was really annoying seeing csms pass you by when you need help and act like they didn't hear you, The hardest part of working here was the unorganization and lack of management helping. The best part was helping and making customers happy.",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Site2Store ,"Westminster, CA",3/1/17,2017,3,1

"At the time, not too good","I had this job awhile back, and at that time the store was in a bit of a mess. I, and fellow coworkers, did not know who our supervisor was as we ever saw them. Instead of telling us themselves, nearly all the managers would send someone to us as their messenger. Because of this, we barely knew the higher ups. However, we would assist in the back to help the trucks unload, so it wasn't all just one thing.

Great work environment with a excellent management crew.,"A day at work for me is simple. It's a two step process, first we unload the truck, followed by stocking the aisles throughout the store.

Some managers count how many times you go to the bathroom, and question you if they think you go to many times. They will hire any freak off the streets that can carry a box or push a button.

"Self focus job,straight to the point",While I worked at the Walmart warehouse I enjoyed it very much. I was a general laborer and in doing that you had your own things that you had to complete before your day was over. If there was a problem you had to find the answer to that problem what ever it was. I worked long days and had not one problem with it. You would work with a different person daily so you had to learn to get along with different people all the time. It was a hard self rewarding job. I had to leave because I was pregnant.,4,Former Employee,Warehouse Generalist ,"Elwood, IL",2/28/17,2017,2,28
Bonuses are amazing,"Compared to my other jobs, Wal-Mart had the biggest bonuses and they were more frequent - quarterly as opposed to every half.

Enjoyable Crew,"Management can be tough, but the other associates and customers make it enjoyable.

Walmart is a great place to work,"I know there are a lot of people who look down at Walmart employees. In most cases Walmart employees are very friendly. Walmart offers tons of programs to help their employees. My typical day would be to stock shelves for the first two hours of my shift while helping customers find anything they may need. Then I would head to the back and help unload different items out of trucks and onto pallets (like electronics, camping equipment, non-frozen food items, ect) Then we pull the loaded pallets out to the floor and stock some of the items onto shelves till CAP 3 gets onto the floor. In all its a great place to work. Management I haven't had too many problems with except for the instructions they would give. One manager would say just make the shelves look nice up front (meaning pull 2 to 3 items forward facing the floor) while the other wants full pull (pull and organize all items facing floor) This happened so often I could have one guy say you did it perfectly while the other is threatening my job. Otherwise the job was great and it has a very social environment. I would suggest if your not very good with communication skills then this is not the job for you. Otherwise, if you love communicating and being part of a team then this would be the job for you",4,Former Employee,Wal-Mart Associate ,"Charleston, IL",2/28/17,2017,2,28

Adequate workplace for an individual seeking advancement,"Working for Walmart was a new experience and one I will not forget. Most days were moderately paced at the cash register and the customer service job was something I rather enjoyed. I learned how to run a register, safety in the building, reporting suspicious characters, and how to be a polite person even in the presence of a rude customer. I learned the importance of maintaining retail and keeping a neat, tidy and positive work environment. I had communication with management and got along well with everyone. The hardest part was days of being understaffed at the register or not having a manager available to assist in purchases requiring an override. I enjoyed most getting to train new people to cashier even though I hadn't been there as long as most people.

Overall a fun and challenging place to work,I found the companies beliefs and values to be true to their employees. The benefits and compensation offered were comparable to the area. The only thing that made me look to other companies was lack of advancement opportunity. The local market was not big enough for the volume of people looking for advancement and relocation was not an option at the time.,3,Former Employee,dairy department associate and a cashier ,"Richland Center, WI",2/27/17,2017,2,27

Learned a lot within the time I worked there,"I was cross trained in every department while working at Neighborhood Market, and even though I took leadership steps and strides to work there, I was denied the opportunity to advance and it was disappointing. I first learned the cash register here, and every day was different since we had to constantly work on new projects and got new inventory, but I eventually learned how to do everything in every department. My main departments were dry grocery and pharmacy/makeup. I was often in charge of managing inventory and making sure everything was correct and up to date within the system. I was often chosen to work as acting Customer Service Manager when the one working had to go on lunch and had to multitask while doing so.",3,Former Employee,SALES FLOOR ASSOCIATE ,"Escondido, CA",2/27/17,2017,2,27

no loyalty,"pay is reasonable to the work required. Training is something you have to seek out. Management is there for themselves and more than willing to throw you under the bus to save themselves. Culture was great 10 to 15 years ago when I 1st started slowly loosing that culture. hardest part of the job was getting up in the morning knowing you you were heading in to bust your rump and received little to no gratitude or respect. Veterans beware, Walmart's hire a Vet initiative is a PR stunt to make them look better to the public. yes they will hire you but that's as far as it goes. There is nothing they do to retain you. Take it from a Vet that worked for Walmart for 15 years with little to no growth (and I promise you its not because i didn't grow).

And, that you should always take the extra step to make the customer happy and always find a way to help if you can. The management was very inconsistent. Something that I did was praised one day, and then scolded the next. Also couldn't really talk to management about anything because no steps were taken to fix any problems. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the amount of money in the cash register was always accounted for, and make sure that if you were running low on certain bills, that you request change a little ahead of time because sometimes it took a while before a CSM could get to you.

Electronics at one of the busiest Wal-Marts,"Job requires the incredible flexibility to be moving freight, scanning items as a cashier and also pitching sales to potential customers all within a single shift. I worked at one of the busiest stores so management was pretty on top of running things and keeping the workplace clean and functioning. Culture of my store was eerily family like just because of the culture of Wal-Mart is to give the company 40 years and retire, so people stick around long enough that everyone knows everyone. People get territorially over chances to move up because of the fact people stay on for careers. Overall it's exactly what you expect for a retail job just compounded by the fact Wal-Mart is what it is.

Hardworking employees with optimistic attitudes,"A typical day at Walmart Supercenter in Central, SC as an employee taught me how to put others first and make sure every customer was satisfied to the fullest. I learned that you have to treat every customer with respect regardless of their attitude, persona, and/or actions. To be completely honest, the management there on a scale from 1 to 10 they were probably a 3 at the most. The workplace culture was very diverse and interesting in more ways than one. You meet so many different people from around the city, state, country, and from around the world even. The hardest part of the job was probably having to help the customers that were so rude, derogatory, and just down right mean as a hornet. You always have to keep calm, cool, and collected though or else you wouldn't be able to make it at any job, truthfully.

Now that they are at the top, they don't mind enforcing the rule on others._x000D__x000D_Additionally, they are asking for more work time from associates.

Depends on who you ask..,"A typical day at work starts off really well, until it came to your lunch time. The CSM's would forget to let you go to lunch which would cause you to get flagged. When you get flagged, it can actually cause you to lose your job. I learned how to handle difficult customers, bag items properly, work in a very fast paced environment, and how to make people happy. Management was hard to deal with at times, when you needed them the most, they weren't around to help you. The workplace culture was pretty good, everyone was lenient on tattoos, piercings, and colored hair in the workplace. The hardest part was dealing with very difficult customers, it's not the fact it was hard, it was the fact that no matter what you tried to do they weren't satisfied.

Associate Position,It was a normal day of working and do what you can do to get the work done. I have learned about of how it works in the workplace. And still learning how to cooperate and communicate barrier with customers and managers. It is difficult for one person to do all the work and timing to get it done is most difficult to do.

Terrible Culture and Management,"Working for Walmart was a blessing and a nightmare. They allow for flexible scheduling of work hours, even as a member of management. This is great if one has a complex out of work life, such as school or a family. However, there is a pervasive, overwhelmingly negative culture permeating the entire organization. The corporate attempts at a warm and positive culture are so transparent and fake that they have the opposite effect. The pay was terrible for the work done. Management seemed to bully or treat associates badly as if it were to ""get back"" at the company for how they were treated prior to becoming management. Its also very discouraging to lose an inventory management position to an automated computer based system that worked very poorly.",2,Former Employee,Inventory Manger ,"Carson City, NV",2/22/17,2017,2,22

its ok,"if you like being timed and micromanaged this will be a great place to work. its very much a logistics job. Everything you do is timed as an order filler. Including the time it take you to get to and from breaks as well as clocking out. There is no margin for wasted time at this job. If you dont hit standard you will be fired after a few weeks. Even once i learned how to order fill i found the standard sometimes doesnt give you a realistic amount of time. And management will ask you to do other things and they wont always adjust your time correctly for it. Some people catch on and some just dont. The job isnt for everyone. Order filling is incredibly tedious though. if youre the weekend shift you will only work 3 days a week, but be ready to only average about 30 hours per week. the hourly pay is best in the industry but my weekly take home only averaged about 500 a week for the whopping 3 months i was there.

Good for young employees,"The environment at Walmart is very friendly, your coworkers are respectful and your management will do their best to make sure you're doing the things you need to do to advance. With my experience, Walmart as a company is reluctant to work with a college schedule. Walmart does not pay much care to the health of their employees in the aspect of calling in when needed. Doctor's notes do not matter in place of absences. You will be treated like you are expendable because you are. So as long as you maintain attendance and your location can/will work with college/school hours, Walmart is a good company to work as a starter job.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"High Ridge, MO",2/19/17,2017,2,19

The associates who work hard are always pushed harder, while the lazy associates get away with doing nothing and no one holds them accountable. All management teams I've worked with in each facility seem to struggle with the same thing; accountability. You're either told they're handling it and they forget, or nothing happens at all.

Not a very nice company to work for,"Walmart has this policy of cutting employees hours to save money on wages, which leaves the department undermanned. There is no way possible to take care of the customer's needs when a department is undermanned. Customer's get upset and decide to shop somewhere else. So in their attempt to save 20,000 a year in wages, Walmart is sacrificing 100,000 a year in income that it would have made if they had a financial policy in place to keep customers happy. It is not smart, is not sensible, and is not sound. In addition, it leaves employees unsatisfied with the company.

"Great Coworkers, questionable Management","We would meet at the start of every shift on where we were going to be that. The problem is that way too often the labor hours did not match up with how many people we had. For instance I worked in the frozen food area, and the labor hours were often above the hours that I could work. And the hours were often 12 hours or better. And that does not include having to go out to push carts, or help with a meat & and produce truck, or the zone that had to be done before leaving.

Worst place to work,I was only here for six months. I was going to school at the same time as working here and they would constantly change the schedule.

One day I would close at 10 p.m. and then be expected to come back at 5 a.m. Managers are supposed to switch departments to be able to become a store manager so the understand how each department runs but most of them have never actually worked in the department they run so they have unreachable expectations for their workers because most of the time they don't schedule enough people to work in a department a day and expect you to go and finish another departments work along with your own.,1,Former Employee,GARDEN CENTER AND PRODUCE SALES ASSOCIATE ,"Marquette, MI",2/16/17,2017,2,16

At the same time, you will assist the cashier by bagging the items appropriately and carrying them to the customer's cart. If the customer seems to be struggling, you might also be asked to help them load their groceries  into their car. After a few examples from the cashier, you might be asked to take over and run the register for the next few customers, or the customer service manager (CSM) might ask a cashier to train you on a closed lane in training mode on the register. (You will practice with real items on a fake transaction of which will not actually be purchased. It's just to give you a feel of how to do things.) _x000D_By your fourth day, the CSM might ask how comfortable you feel running the register on your own and you might get your first lane by yourself to run the register and do regular transactions.

This place is terrible,"Customer Service/Sales is stressful, you don't get paid enough, management doesn't back you up if customers are wrong, they don't care about their workers, and they have to put up with too much for too little money for the hours that they get.

Don't work here.",1,Former Employee,Assist clients ,"Wheeling, IL",2/9/17,2017,2,9
Not something I liked.,The pay is good that is something I did like. They ask for your availability but I would always end up scheduled during class time no matter how many times I corrected them. They said they would give me 25 hours when I had heavy load courses but still gave me close to 35 hours or 36 hours. There were people that needed more hours so I do not understand why they didn't give more hours to those who needed them.I was very happy and cheerful at first but management can be very rude and my cheerfulness didn't last. Management doesn't communicate and it causes a lot of problems. Some of the managers are not very well trained and do not know how to handle certain situations in a professional manner. Some members of management are really good but the majority doesn't seem to care or know what they are doing. When I finally confronted them about my scheduled hours there was retaliation from my supervisor. I asked around and other associates (not just students) that work there have gone through the same situation. They do not follow the policy the way they should which often causes a lot problems with customers.,2,Former Employee,Cashier/Money Center/Customer Service ,"Edinburg, TX",2/9/17,2017,2,9

Great people but I need more money and security,Walmart is great. Once you get to the benifits. You do not get any discount until 3 months in. You will constantly get yelled at by coustomers but no matter what happens the management is usually always understandable to the situation. They are willing to work with your hours. The only thing is if you are sick or the roads are so bad that it is highly dangerous for you to drive you only get four times to call out within a six-month period. That is very hard when everyone is sick during the winter and when it is always snowing. More than likely it will always be held against you if you call out for any of those reasons or even if you have a family member that is in need of you being there.,4,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Concord, NH",2/9/17,2017,2,9

"Hard work, but worth it","My shifts at Walmart typically consisted of determining which items needed to be stocked, and retrieving them from the backroom. Another major aspect of my job was zoning the shelves, which meant that I would pull items to the front of the shelves so they would appear fully stocked. I generally had little direct supervision and would often not be given a specific task to do when I arrived at work, but I did not take that as an excuse to be lazy, and would diligently do my job until my shift was over.",2,Former Employee,Sales Floor Associate ,"Lawrence, KS",2/8/17,2017,2,8

Fun environment depending on who's working that day,Walmart needs to hold a training at least once a year for the managers to teach them how to handle customers as well as associates. The managers in some stores are never on time when it comes to opening up certain departments for vendors and customers. Cashiers and customers have to wait several minutes before cashing out because money is not prepared on time. If a customer has an issue and wants to speak to a manager the customer is kept waiting to at least 20 minutes for a manager respond.,4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2/8/17,2017,2,8

horrible place to work at no reasonable management,A day at work is having customers come up to me and smiling because i took care of them and made sure their orders were right.

Productive and fun work place with great opportunities,"During my typical workday at Walmart I am responsible for providing my customers with excellent customer service and I do that by going above and beyond for the customers and my managers. I also have to make sure that I work the freight I'm given so I can restock the items in its correct location. Working at walmart I learned how to use a scanning gun which tells what items need to be ordered and it also tells you which bin the item is placed in.  The managers at walmart care about their employees, they're respectful and they offer you an opportunity to move up in the company. When the store is not that busy it's nice and quiet and you're able to finish the tasks you're given in a timely manner instead of rushing when it's packed. The hardest part of my job is when i have a lot of freight with so little time to finish , I say that because when a customer needs help looking for something they sometimes want you to take them to the item instead of pointing in the direction it's in. The part I enjoy the most is when I know I've made a customer happy by giving them my time and patience, I also enjoy when my hard word is noticed and appreciated it makes me feel good to know that I'm doing an excellent job.",5,Current Employee,Backroom Associate ,"Secaucus, NJ",2/8/17,2017,2,8

It was a lot of favoritism going on within the company. Other than that it was ok. A typical work day involved clocking in, going to my department and getting started on freight. Putting product on shelves and making the aisle look nice, after i was done with that i would go outside and help with loading customers vehicles and mop and sweep. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the different personality's of different customers. the most enjoyable part was payday, lol. just kidding. i enjoyed what i did very much and i was very upset when i had to part ways, but everything happens for a reason..",2,Former Employee,Cashier/Sales Associate Garden Center ,"Utica, NY",2/2/17,2017,2,2

As Expected,"Nearly all of my training from Walmart was done on a computer for the first week. After I had completed the very boring and unhelpful training program I was thrust into the work with very little explanation of what exactly it was that I was supposed to do. The typical day consisted of unloading stock from a truck off a line and onto the pallets organized by the departments. After that I moved onto stocking shelves. If any products were damaged or spilled I would clean the mess and take the product to the back and claim it out. I learned a lot about how a big retail store functions and what it takes to keep one moving, but I felt I meant little to the company and was considered expendable. Despite that, though, almost all the employees were friendly and my managers and supervisors always helped me if I had any question. My coworkers were friendly, and I got along well with them all.

Sucked,It's a horrible choice unless you're seriously hard up. Next to nobody knows much of anything about the stuff in their department besides the bare minimum (sometimes not even that much).

You dress, talk & act more professional then your Superior others and yet don't get advanced because here in Yakima, WA at the Nob Hill wal-mart it's not those who work hard that get promoted it's those that they personally like. They turn bums that have been working there for a few months into CSM's when theres VERY HARD WORKING people there thats been cashiering for years that would do it better & easily deserve the job.

Not bad for a first job,"Not a bad job for someone looking for their first job out of highschool. Somewhat flexible with school schedules and days needed off or short shifts. But sometimes they ""lose"" time off requests or don't follow set availability for anyone. Depending on the store, it's a decent environment. Fellow workers dislike being there so they take it out on you, they also like to reward and advance the people that don't do anything. They also tend to overlook major things like short staff, until a customer complains about someone and that person gets in trouble for nothing. Very biased company that just cares about padding their pockets.",3,Former Employee,Sales Associate ,"Mansfield, PA",1/29/17,2017,1,29
Bad Bad,"Management is awful at the auburndale wal mart. they managers are not open minded as they just want you to suck up to them all day and do exactly what they say as they run around the store mingling with each other.

Really great place to work.,"A typical day at work would consist of checking customers out at the register, answering customers questions about anything form cell phones to video game consoles, activating and transferring both_x000D_prepaid and contract/post paid cell phone plans, zoning, stocking, and working other departments around the store such_x000D_as: Toys, front Cashier, Sporting Goods, Pets, garden Center and Grocery fairly regularly.

Most of my day was dealing with customers and helping them find what they need. Management is biggest variable when you work for Walmart. Some are great and some either don't do their jobs, are constantly trying to get under your skin or doing something else that frustrates you, but most are just like everyone else. They are people that love where they work and are great to work under. The hardest part of the job was working under managers that don't understand how your department works. They get sent over to deal with your area and they just start to try and change how everything works. They just didn't have any experience with how we did things. The best part was becoming friends with all your co-workers and regular customers. If you're a friendly person, it's like working with family.",4,Former Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Orange, TX",1/29/17,2017,1,29

I honestly wouldnt recommend working here to anyone,I personally think that management is very rude and unprofessional. The heart of the store is management and you cant promote smiling faces and happy customers if you have an attitude all day. I think that my co- workers were pretty nice and I miss some of them but had to resign.

Walmart Super-center Waukesha,"Typically good for hours. Management there is not completely developed. Some managers are good , while others have some skills they could work on(Leadership Wise). Managers there always expected too much while not actually helping achieve the goals set. Benefits as far as paid vacations hours where good though, they basically started racking up after training. The sick policy is lacking though. I almost lost my job because I was sick for a week with a really bad stomach flu(They did not care about a doctors note).

"Managements expectations were only @ ankle level, which became a continuous trip hazard.","Granted, this is my personal experience working at only one WalMart location. I realize that each location has its own culture based on local workforce pools and doesn't reflect the culture that Corporate WalMart may have in mind or may portray. WalMart Distribution, Terrell, TX. however, pretty much did their own thing. Many times during my 18 mos. there, I was told by mgmt., ""We can't possibly adhere to ALL the company rules. We can't tell you which ones not to adhere to, but we can't tell you which ones we adhere to either."" In general, I found that mgmt., across the board, was ignorant of corporate policy, and discouraged and badgered anyone seeking deeper understanding of the policies. The maintenance department was very negligent of Arc Flash policies, continually disregarded lockout/tagout prodedures when it suited them best. _x000D__x000D_My overall experience there discouraged me from having any desire to apply there again.",1,Former Employee,Industrial Electrician ,"Terrell, TX",1/28/17,2017,1,28

Whether it is something that you only plan on doing for a short period of time or a full fledged career Walmart is the place. Being a cashier was usually an alright job. The absolute most difficult aspect are the customers themselves. Not all the customers, but the ones who are having a bad day. Sometimes it's not easy.

Probably the worst place to work,"In your first 6 months of working at Walmart, you have 4 points before you are terminated. They refuse to accept doctors notes unless you are terminally ill, so if you get sick and miss work, you receive a point. You do not get full time until you get to six months.

I highly suggest not working for walmart.",1,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Saint Charles, MO",1/28/17,2017,1,28
Fast paced work and a lot of customer service,"When I would come into work, we would start unloading the trucks and sorting the boxes according to the department and aisle that it belonged to. I learned that I was not suited for retail.. Management depends on who it is. I had a manager who was sexist and hated me so working was miserable.

Love it best when its busy.  Very rewarding due to customers.,"Very badly managed at the store level.  WalMart as a corporation runs a tight ship.  Very admirable.  However, at the individual stores, management is rotated frequently.

Fun Place to Work but No Flexibility,"I loved working at WalMart, the other cashiers were always friendly, the store manager always said Hi and was nice.  The customers were friendly and I was good at my job.  The biggest downfall is the flexibility in hours and maintaining a regular schedule.  I'm a single mom and am not available to work after about 5:30.  WalMart wants you to be available until 11 pm every single night in order to work full time there.  I was seeking part-time, 28 hours per week.  And it was like pulling just to get that on a weekly basis, even though that's what we agreed to when I was hired.  Eventually I was cut back significantly and I spoke with my manager twice about it.  I was told that WalMart is fully staffed and the hours I was getting have to be given to other people too.  Also, I was told, people who work at night don't always want to work at night and the computer system is trying to be fair to everyone.  This is not right, an agreement is an agreement.  I wouldn't think a company like WalMart would have a hard time giving a single mom 28 hours per week, but they did.  So I was left out in the cold with few hours because of a computer system that was trying to be fair to everyone...  wasn't fair.",4,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Le Mars, IA",1/27/17,2017,1,27

Security and worklife balance was not favorable.,I was the only employee assigned to the toy section so my work days were very hectic. We had employees who would take off and quit which left me covering many shifts without a team to work with. I learned time management and to ask for help when needed. Department managers were extremely nice and supportive. Store managers were rude and unsupportive. There were times of strong teamwork and communication when needed amongst departments. There wasnt much workplace drama and everyone who showed up for work came focused. The hardest part of the job was being the only person in the toy department.

Productive and fun working place,"An average day in the warehouse can be full of different emotions. Sometimes there is excitement, confusion, or frustration. I get excited when I see a new challenge, but sometimes frustrated when results are not solely in my control. Our managers take the time to learn about us as individuals, and apply that knowledge when placing us in areas as a team. I have learned that the quality of the service that we provide is the most important factor, not just getting the job done. Time management is the hardest part of the job, though after gaining experience it can be mastered. Management was'nt the best at times, but I still managed to get my work done at a reasonably time. I can honestly say that the job was fairly easy and i really enjoyed working at Walmart.

multi functioning position,Walmart was a god company to work for and if you wanted to learn something different from what you already know they were quick to teach you. I enjoyed learning many different positions and areas of the store and it helped me to become the manager that I am today. You were held accountable for your attendance which is important to me. If you are not at work you cannot perform your job at the rate you should. One thing that I did not like about the company is that they claim to be big on Respect the Individual yet co-workers can treat you horribly and they do nothing about it. Customers can also treat you like garbage and you HAVE to take it.

Stress free environment with accessible Management.,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent at Walmart. A typical day at work for me entailed going to the back and clocking in. Then I went to the front of the store and scanned my badge into a computer system that would direct me to the cash register I was assigned to. If I came across an issue while checking out a customer. I was trained to call a member of management to come assist. While I was waiting for them to come I had polite conversation with the customer. I learned  how to properly stock shelves, price items, handle a cash register, and how to unload a truck. The management their is very friendly and easy to approach.  The environment was very relaxed and friendly . All of my coworkers were kind and genuine people that instantly helped me feel happy that I got to work with them. The hardest part of the job for me personally was working at self checkout because you have to constantly be looking to make sure nobody is stealing. I didn't want anyone to steal something right under my nose. So whenever I was in self checkout I was a little bit more stressed then at a regular cash register. My favorite part of the job was interacting with the customers and making sure they left my register happier then when they came to it.",5,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Cheyenne, WY",1/26/17,2017,1,26

Interesting place to work.,"Walmart is a very interesting place to work. Working at a register, I was able to meet and talk with many people whom had different back grounds and opinions. Working in this environment I was able to get to know many different people and be exposed to many different opinions. This gave me a relative idea about how to interact with people on a professional and personal scale._x000D_Management was always a little thin. It seemed that they only ever had two CSMs on the sales floor, but they were tenacious and somehow made it work._x000D_The hardest part of the job was often dealing with a compromising situation involving a customer and lack of information. Walmart has many rules and guidelines we are expected to follow, but some situations can arise where there is no set rule or guideline for dealing with the situation.

Decent Pay with flexible hours,"I've been at Walmart for over a year now and my department has no problem keeping up with the company expectations, however, the amount of work the managers have you do at the same time cutting your hours to benefit the business just doesn't seem correct to me. Walmart has treated me pretty well though they gave me promotions throughout the store from being a regular associate to a customer service manager and now a department manager, on top of I have regular hours Monday-Friday 630-330 weekends off and they give me all the vacation time I want. Over all I enjoy the company but stressing out daily to keep your department in order then coming in the next day to have it be a mess again and having to take the blame since it's your department isn't really for me.

Good for those who like this kind of work.,"Honestly it isn't terrible if this is the type of job you'd want. I love Electronics but honestly I feel Walmart has a very poor selection, at least at my store. The rudest of customers will always flock to this area of the store, as will the thieves. I personally cannot keep a smile on to rude people, so it isn't the job for me. However, a job is a job, but here at Walmart, if management needs someone somewhere else for a bit, they'll be sure to make you do someone else's job too. It's ridiculous. I would probably like it much more if I wasn't being pulled to the front to run register, or do things in Garden center, or stupid things like that I never signed up for. I'm not the type to care too much, and at times, this job is great. I've made a lot of friends with coworkers, and I've also made some decent conversations with some customers. When you get good hours, you get good money, but Walmart LOVES to cut hours, so be ready to work more than one job, or try to burn your tail off getting full time, which will probably not happen, even if you're the best at what you do. In closing, I see this as a hold over job. If you need a job badly and this is offered, take it until you find something that pays more and makes you feel better as a person.",2,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,Alabama,1/23/17,2017,1,23

efun place,"A typical day at work was working hard and taking care of customers. I learned to work a register and the types of attitudes you got to take care of in a calm nice manner. The management did a great job at they're own job, but would somewhat fail at taking care of the associates due to them talking to other co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when you had so much to scan and you were going as quickly as possible and find out they were buying a spilling product and you had to clean it up while rescanning everything.

Walmart,A typical day at Walmart is running freight and assisting customers. I learned how to connect with the customers to get a better idea of what they are looking for. example: There are times that I didn't know  exactly what the customer was looking for so I would look it up and if i still couldn't find it I would go check with a manager to see if we sold the item. Management surely did not work as a team . There was one manager that could hold the store together and everyone worked together as a team. The other two managers made everyone feel unappreciated and like we we're walking on egg shells.

For example, I would do cupcakes one day and fill the racks and one day I would decorate cakes and prepare backstock. By the end of my shift I would make sure all of my utensils were clean and my work area was cleaned. My time here, I learned how to base ice cakes and basic cake decorating designs. Throughout my time here the management was enforced, honestly at times but not very well communicated. Walmart overall was very diverse and open to all types of people. The customer always comes first. The most enjoyable part of my day was making a customers vision of their celebration come to life through food art.

They would tell you your wrong even if you did exactly what they asked of you, they were extremely short and rude in conversation made you feel less of a person.",2,Former Employee,Deli Associate ,"Spokane, WA",1/21/17,2017,1,21
Walmart is a good place to start out working,"A typical day at Walmart has you doing just about every job you could think of in retail. You're constantly learning about customer service and the industry. Management drives you to work in a way that drives you to excel in your area. The only hard part about the job is that it gets very monotonous after some time. While you can learn a fair amount in this setting, nothing really ever changes. The best part of the job though is how social it can be. You can meet hundreds of people in a single work day, most of which are more than happy to carry on a casual conversation and joke around with you.",3,Current Employee,Cashier ,"Brownsville, PA",1/21/17,2017,1,21

Very productive and fast pace.,Walmart is one of the best companies I have worked for. The management team and the associates conduct themselves with integrity and always work as safe as possible.

The company's benefits and shares within the company are also very good.,5,Current Employee,Inventory Control Quality Assurance ,"Atlanta, GA",1/21/17,2017,1,21
"Fun coworkers, but awful customers","Got there, punched in, and went to my manger to see what register number i obtained for the day. Every once in awhile i would have to move registers to cover other cashiers when they went on breaks or lunch. Only downfall is that the registers rely so much on management every time they needed to be unlocked or opened, and management would usually take awhile to come.",3,Former Employee,Cashier ,"Las Vegas, NV",1/21/17,2017,1,21
Walmart is a good business to work for,Walmart gave me my first chance to work when I did not have any work experience before. I was treated well as a co-worker and given the chance to advance to my first manager experience.,4,Former Employee,Lawn & Garden Sales Floor Associate ,"Las Cruces, NM",1/21/17,2017,1,21
Typical retail workplace with a twist,"Originally I applied here for a sales floor associate/stocking job and it was what I would expect from a retail job. However, due to the fact that this place tended to be low on workers, I was placed on almost every part of the store. To list most of it off I worked in: groceries, stationary, sporting goods, frozen foods, dairy, truck unloading, cashier, stocking shelves in respective aisles, as well as working in the back of the store. It was kind of a shame how to make up for lack of workers that they have the associates do all types of work. Perhaps I was moved to all parts of the store since I adapted quickly and the managers saw that, but that is mere speculation. The jobs for the most part were straight forward and easy to understand. Management for the most part wasn't really a problem till they kept changing management to the point where eventually even the workers didn't like the change that was going on. I'm not sure if that is a problem now but when I was working I disliked the ""new"" management that took over. At the very least, I got a board array of skills unintentionally from that job.",3,Former Employee,Stocker/Cashier ,"Freehold, NJ",1/21/17,2017,1,21

Customer friendly,There are no typical days at Walmart as each day brings new and different challenges. You learn to change with the job as it changes around you. The management tends to have a hands off approach until they are needed then they are micromanagers. The culture of Walmart is pretty basic; each departments employees help one another. The hardest part of the job is the changing shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the daily interaction between customers and employees.,3,Former Employee,Sales Associate/ Inventory Control Specialist ,"Porter, TX",1/21/17,2017,1,21

Simple work and easy hours,"I have worked at Walmart in the past. I had to leave the store I was working at because of relocating with my family, but I had planned on quitting either way. The ,main reason I had decided to quit was because management changed my job title right before I was eligible to receive a raise, and then told me that they wouldn't do anything about it.  I would have stayed at the company had the management been a bit better. The specific store was in Midlothian, Texas. The management was slacking and did not take care of the employees. I had a great time working there and would definitely go back under different management at a different store.",4,Former Employee,Cashier/Customer Service ,"Murchison, TX",1/21/17,2017,1,21

So that isnt true. _x000D__x000D_The hours are long, because of mismanagement, and they have absolutely no problem making good workers pick up slack from bad ones, with no appreciation shown.

A environment that helps.,"A typical day at work is coming to work on time and staying productive throughout your shift because if you do not do these steps constantly then you are letting yourself down and others that work with you.

"Structurally sound, but extremely stressful","A typical night of work always began with some sort of staff meeting and job assignment for fellow associates and I. After that we would all move to the floor and or assigned tasks, with very few hiccups. It was required in the particular Wal-Mart I worked at more than some others due to the very small staff available each night. Most of the things I learned, I had to learn by myself since there was little time to spare for managers or other more experienced associates. The hardest part of the job in my experience was just getting used to not seeing the sun much when you worked nights, and the stress of being short staffed on a night with a 2100 piece truck. There was always stress and always camaraderie during those times, but there was also no shortage of stress induced snapping at each other. Normal for most places or work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the store so well that any shopping you had to do there was really quick. Or easily being able to help a customer without even really thinking about it.",3,Former Employee,Sales/Stocker ,"Salem, MO",1/20/17,2017,1,20

It is a good in between jobs kind of job.,"You meet a lot of great people.  I have not had the greatest experience with upper management, but lower management has been great! The job itself is very easy and you don't have to have too much going on upstairs to understand what to do.  A typical day at work starts off for me early in the morning, I help out my department manager by splitting the load.  We then take our freight from the truck that had arrived and we work everything into its proper home.  Through out the day we get more freight to be worked, as we are working freight we also zone up the area to make it look nice and so the prices reflect the accurate products.  Essentially that is all that is done.  Personally I would help out management in getting the sections refreshed and I would be in charge of setting up and painting all of the Demo units, i.e. Tablets, TV's, Laptops.  I would also help out in the similar departments to electronics, so Wireless Phone Center, Photo Center, and the Online Pickup Center.  It is a fairly relaxed job with the occasional unhappy manager.  You could do the absolute best that could possibly be done and some managers just can't be pleased, but you try your best anyways and make your self and everyone else pleased.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with particularly difficult customers and managers, other than that it is fairly easy.  The most enjoyable part was definitely the friends you make on the job.  Over all it is not a bad or hard job at all, but it is not something you would want to do for the rest of your life either.  So it is a good temporary job to help you - more...",2,Current Employee,Electronics Sales Associate ,"Riverton, UT",1/20/17,2017,1,20

"Wal-Mart Peons, Rooks, and Kings","This job is a mixed bag of everything. Some days are great, while others are terrible. Believe it or not, the customers bring the most influence on how well a day goes for associates. The environment is very dynamic, with each day bringing forth its own challenges. If you get a chance for advancement, it is certainly worth it in the long run. You have to fight hard to earn full-time, yet alone, advancements. However, those advancements come with great pay once you get beyond a department manager, as well as job security.

Terribly mismanaged,"Typical assignment in the store varies with the manager on duty - not necessarily a negative. Most problems stem from upper management , and Walmart culture and expectations in general. Manager hardly allows more than one day off at a time and never a particular set day off. Hour cuts are common and the open door policy is useless with current management when addressing these concerns. Pay is often inadequate, and other associates are routinely cut from the schedule when they are needed in the store - creating unnecessarily high workloads.

If you have a lot to give they will take it,Customers make this job great. You can not go a day with out a crazy minute. If you have the right mind set you can make it great. Days go fast because it is almost always busy. I learned so much in my 16 years and worked with great people that it would be hard to start with one thing.

"Okay place to work, except the management at this location.","The job wasn't that bad, and it paid fairly well. However, the management at this particular location didn't treat employees very well, and it made for an unpleasant work environment. They didn't do very much themselves and had unrealistic expectations about the workload. I typically get along with others quite well, and certainly don't harbor any prejudice against management, but I didn't care for the attitude of my manager or some of my co-workers. I was working 3rd shift, which sometimes means working with odd characters. The hardest part of the job wasn't any physical aspect of it. It was dealing with the manager incessantly checking up on everyone and acting like nobody was working fast enough. Constantly being bothered only decreases morale, and decreased morale hurts productivity. The biggest hassle was having to face and organize the shelves every single day at the end of my shift because the prior shift was instructed by their manager to fill in gaps with product that doesn't belong in the gaps, knowing that my job is to then undo everything they did--only to have them yet again undo my job every single day.",3,Former Employee,Stocker/Customer Service ,"Portage, WI",1/19/17,2017,1,19
