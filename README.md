### :airplane: [Air Travel Safety](https://github.com/SurenaNokham/SurenaNokham.github.io/tree/main/Air%20Travel%20Safety)
This portfolio showcases a series of data visualization projects focused on airline safety. It includes dashboards, executive summaries, blog posts, infographics, and video presentations, each aimed at correcting public misconceptions influenced by sensationalized media reports. Tailored to different audiences‚Äîfrom the general public to executive committees‚Äîeach project aims to present clear, concise, and engaging data-driven insights, reinforcing the message that air travel remains one of the safest modes of transportation. This portfolio demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data presentation and strategic communication.

### :seedling: [Crop Recommendation](https://github.com/SurenaNokham/SurenaNokham.github.io/tree/main/Crop%20Recommendation)
This project utilizes machine learning to develop a crop recommendation system based on soil properties and environmental factors. By analyzing data on soil nutrients, pH levels, moisture, and climate conditions, the model provides personalized crop planting suggestions aimed at maximizing yield and sustainability. The project applies several classification algorithms to predict the most suitable crops for given soil and weather conditions, helping farmers make data-driven decisions to improve agricultural productivity.

### :brain: [Depression Rates by Country](https://github.com/SurenaNokham/SurenaNokham.github.io/tree/main/Depression%20Rates%20by%20Country)
This analytical project examines the prevalence of depression across various countries, utilizing global health datasets to identify patterns and contributing factors to mental health issues. By integrating data from the World Health Organization and other health surveillance sources, the study employs statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to compare depression rates internationally. Insights from this project are intended to inform health policy makers and public health officials, offering a clearer understanding of mental health trends and aiding in the development of targeted interventions.

### üõ†Ô∏è [Home Repair Database Project](https://github.com/SurenaNokham/SurenaNokham.github.io/tree/main/Home%20Repair%20DB%20Project)
This project involves creating a comprehensive database system for Bob's Home Repairs, a small company that handles minor home repair jobs. The project includes developing an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, designing normalized tables in third normal form, and writing SQL scripts to create and populate the database. Key SQL queries are also provided to manage business operations such as tracking customer bids, payments, and material purchases. The goal is to streamline Bob's operations, reduce manual bookkeeping, and support the business's growth by leveraging a robust and efficient database system.

### üé• [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/SurenaNokham/SurenaNokham.github.io/tree/main/Movie%20Recommendation%20System)
This project involves creating a movie recommender system using the TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations. The dataset, sourced from MovieLens, includes movie titles and genres. The recommender system works by converting movie genres into a TF-IDF matrix, computing cosine similarity scores between movies, and recommending ten movies similar to a user-specified title. This process ensures users receive movie suggestions based on genre similarities, enhancing their viewing experience by presenting them with titles that match their preferences. The system is tested and demonstrated to provide accurate and relevant recommendations.

### :books: [Personalized Book Recommender](https://github.com/SurenaNokham/SurenaNokham.github.io/tree/main/Personalized%20Book%20Recommender)
The Personalized Book Recommender system is designed to enhance the reading experience by suggesting books that align with individual user preferences and past reading habits. Utilizing collaborative filtering and natural language processing techniques, this project analyzes user reviews and book metadata to create a sophisticated recommendation engine. The system not only helps readers discover new books but also supports publishers and libraries in effectively curating content to meet reader demand.

### üéµ [Predicting Song Popularity](https://github.com/SurenaNokham/SurenaNokham.github.io/tree/main/Predicting%20Song%20Popularity)
This project analyzes the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023" dataset to identify factors driving song popularity. Using exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques, we evaluated attributes like tempo and playlist inclusion. Despite challenges with model accuracy, the project provided insights into how these factors influence streaming success, helping music industry stakeholders make data-driven decisions to boost song visibility and audience engagement.

### :factory: [Rendering Plant Yield Study](https://github.com/SurenaNokham/SurenaNokham.github.io/tree/main/Rendering%20Plant%20Yield%20Study)
This project focuses on optimizing production processes in rendering plants through detailed analysis of yield data. By examining factors such as input material quality, processing temperatures, and equipment efficiency, the study aims to identify key variables affecting yield in rendering operations. Advanced statistical methods and predictive modeling are employed to propose operational improvements that can lead to enhanced efficiency and reduced waste. The findings are expected to support industry efforts in sustainability and cost reduction.

### ü¶† [Seasonal Foodborne Outbreak Analysis](https://github.com/SurenaNokham/SurenaNokham.github.io/tree/main/Seasonal%20Foodborne%20Outbreak%20Analysis)
This project explores the seasonal variation in foodborne illness outbreaks using data from the CDC (1998-2015). The hypothesis is that foodborne illnesses peak during summer months (June, July, August) due to warmer temperatures and increased outdoor cooking. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), various statistical methods, including histograms, CDFs, and analytical distributions, were applied to identify patterns and correlations. The analysis revealed a spike in outbreaks during summer, but further investigation with more quantitative data is needed to confirm causal relationships. This project aims to enhance understanding of seasonal impacts on foodborne illnesses to improve public health strategies.

### ‚òπÔ∏è [Walmart Employee Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/SurenaNokham/SurenaNokham.github.io/tree/main/Walmart%20Employee%20Sentiment%20Analysis)
This project aims to analyze sentiment in Walmart employee reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By applying logistic regression to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative, the project seeks to uncover insights into employee satisfaction and retention. Key findings include trends in employee ratings over time, common themes in reviews, and sentiment distribution across different job roles. This analysis helps Walmart identify areas for improvement and enhance overall employee satisfaction, ultimately contributing to a more engaged and productive workforce.
