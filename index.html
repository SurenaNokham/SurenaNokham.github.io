        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Surena Nokham, also known as Feyra. I was a microbiologist and am now studying to become a data scientist. I enjoy reading, listening to Audible, being a foodie, spending time with my Bichon and German Shepherd, and binge-watching good shows. Currently, I'm working on several data science projects, including analyzing sentiment trends in social media and creating personalized book recommendations using user reading habits. My goal is to leverage data science to provide actionable insights and solutions.</p>
