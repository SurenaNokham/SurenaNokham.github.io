        <h1>About</h1>
        <img src="profilepic.jpg" alt="Feyra Nokham" style="width:280px; height:336px;">
        <p>Hello and Welcome to my Portfolio! I'm Surena Nokham but all my life I've gone by my middle name, Feyra (pronounced like Farrah). I was a Microbiologist and am now studying to become a data scientist. I enjoy reading, listening to Audible, being a foodie, spending time with my Bichon and German Shepherd, and binge-watching good shows. Currently, I'm working on several data science projects, including analyzing sentiment trends in social media and creating personalized book recommendations using user reading habits. My goal is to leverage data science to provide actionable insights and solutions.</p>
        
        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p>I am currently the Analyst Data for the R&D Data Management Team at Tyson Foods Inc., where my primary responsibility is overseeing the migration of legacy Hillshire plants into Tyson's sophisticated Labeling System. As the Subject Matter Expert for Tyson Labeling System (TLS) and Tyson Label Generator (TLG), my role encompasses a broad spectrum of technical and operational functions. These include the creation, maintenance, and updating of label templates using Adobe Illustrator, a tool in which I have gained considerable proficiency. Additionally, I ensure the efficient distribution of labels to plants via TLG upon request and act as the emergency contact for critical downtime issues, swiftly troubleshooting problems or coordinating with IT and services to restore operations. My responsibilities extend to managing offline projects that fall outside our Product Data Management (PDM) system, keeping meticulous track of inventory, and assisting R&D Scientists with technical issues related to Zebra printers. I also handle box office tickets from plants, resolving emergency incidents and overseeing cost accounting requests to facilitate material management and specification changes within our PDM system.
        <p>Prior to my current role, my career trajectory at Tyson Foods included significant stints as a Senior Research Laboratory Microbiologist, an Associate Laboratory Microbiologist, and a Laboratory Analyst for IEH Laboratories. In these capacities, I honed my skills in executing non-routine processes, conducting comprehensive studies, and standardizing procedures to adhere to food safety standards. My experiences have imbued me with a robust understanding of microbial behaviors, enhancing my capability to lead and streamline workflows while boosting operational efficiency across teams.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I completed my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of Arkansas Fort Smith back in June 2013, and I've proudly added a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science from Bellevue University to my academic credentials in August 2024. This journey through the realms of science and data has deeply enriched my expertise, allowing me to thrive in roles that merge technology with scientific inquiry. It's a privilege to apply this blend of knowledge at Tyson Foods, where I contribute to pioneering innovations at the very crossroads of technology and science.</p>
